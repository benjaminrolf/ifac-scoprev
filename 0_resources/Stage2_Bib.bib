 abstract = {Today, despite the fact that most of the supply chains have a suitable structure and high operative effectiveness, quick changes in the business environment, the high number of innovations, customer's expectations and requirements, increased communication between suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors all contribute to high levels of uncertainty, disruptions, chaotic behaviors, challenges and threats in supply changes. These unexpected risks and natural inevitable changes force supply chain management to adopt new and innovative approaches in order to deal better with risk-related disruptions.The resilient supply chain is one of these approaches. The goal of this study is to use the grounded theory method to investigate the concept of resilience and identify each of the resilience factors in supply chain studies. Adaptability, reversibility/recovery, versatility, reactivity, response to disruption, and the ability to continue working in difficult situations were identified as six main concepts for improving supply chain resilience as a result of analyses. This article will help researchers in their understanding of the concept of supply chain resilience and the factors that influence it. © 2021 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold: to investigate the antecedents of resilience and to highlight the importance of resilience in achieving reconfiguration in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on literature on supply chain resilience and collects data from 253 companies in Qatar to understand the influence of the antecedents of supply chain resilience and the impact of resilience on reconfiguration using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings show that antecedents like risk management culture, agility and collaboration positively affect the supply chain resilience. Further, the study establishes that companies can leverage their supply chain resilience to reconfigure supply chain in case of disruptions. Practical implications: This study is important for supply chain managers in Qatar, as the country faced major disruption of supply chains in wake of the blockade imposed by its neighbors with which it had the only land route and maximum trade. The findings from this study should aid mangers in developing resilient supply chains. Originality/value: This paper highlights the role of supply chain resilience in achieving reconfiguration. Further, novelty of the work reported in this paper lies in its context where supply chains recently faced actual disruptions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to obtain insights into the typology of uncertainty and relevant strategies adopted by manufacturing companies to achieve better supply chain flexibility. Strategies are classified into reactive (buffering) and proactive (redesigning). We develop a framework that links supply chain uncertainty, the two types of strategies for achieving supply chain flexibility and the relevant objectives to be achieved. Four case studies are compared in terms of uncertainty typology and strategies being adopted to improve supply chain flexibility. We present three propositions as a result of the study. First, to achieve better flexibility, companies have been focusing more on buffering than on proactive or redesign strategies. Second, companies tend to focus on internal operations rather than collaborating with external parties, and third, the power structure in a supply chain governs the type and configuration of supply chain flexibility. © 2014 The Author(s).

 abstract = {The concept of a supply chain exists for over twenty years but partners and configuration selection process still is rather unstructured. In order to increase value in any supply chain, a more comprehensive and integrative approach is required to select the right partners and establish the right configuration along the chain. Under economic growth, wrong decisions does not jeopardize profitability dramatically. However, recent economy downtrends has made the choice of suitable partners in the dynamic supply chain a key strategic concern. The nature of these decisions usually is complex and unstructured. This paper aims to present an intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral operator based approach to partners and configuration selection. In order to bring structure in the evaluation process, the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model developed by Supply Research Council is employed. The paper discusses the development of the value chain concept from partners selection perspective, outlines general similarities and differences of the value chain and the SCOR, and uses a simple V-form supply chain example to establish the proposed approach. Finally, results of the application and sensitivity of the results to the change in the selection criteria weights are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We conceptualize dynamic capabilities of a firm as consisting of multiple levels. Capabilities at the highest level affect the formation of first order dynamic supply chain capabilities. Furthermore, first order capabilities modify the operational capabilities. We propose constructs for second and first order dynamic supply chain capabilities. Performance implications of dynamic supply chain capabilities have also been empirically tested based on data from 275 managers from Pakistani manufacturing industry.

@article{Banerjee20123051,
 abstract = {A responsive and flexible supply chain in the global product value chain set-up links the manufacturer with various inter-company entities, such as suppliers, distributors, contract manufacturers and customers to deal with volatile demand. It is imperative and prudent to look at the overall product chain rather than focusing on any single supply chain entity. From a supply chain perspective, it is crucial that these individual entities are lean and agile (leagile) themselves, as well as the overall product value chain. As a result of the global nature of the product value chain, the concept of the decoupling point has undergone a paradigm shift. Through the literature review the authors establish three different types of decoupling point existing in product value chains, namely: (1) product structure decoupling point (PSDP), bill of materials decoupling; (2) supply structure decoupling point (SSDP), supply network decoupling; and (3) demand transfer decoupling point (DTDP), associated with information sharing. It is argued that such decoupling points are already an established and accepted phenomena, but have not been comprehensively discussed until now. It is proposed that, in the global supply chain, PSDP and SSDP are elemental decoupling points and DTDP is a logical decoupling, which is a function of PSDP and SSDP. It is proposed that DTDP swings between PSDP and SSDP and the swing direction is a critical piece of supply chain information that helps identify distortion. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) method is proposed to discover the relationship of DTDP with SSDP and PSDP using interpretation matrices and stress coefficients. Considering the supply chain as a fuzzy system, a combined effect of MDS over fuzzy applications has been used to determine the extent of swing of DTDP in the particular application of the supply chain. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The models currently used to get insight in supply chains assume a predefined supply chain structure, as orders are exogenously defined. Consequently, those models cannot grasp the dynamic nature of supply chains with modular plants. In this paper a market conceptualization based on agent-based computational economics is presented that includes transport costs in the negotiations and enables the modeling of supply chains as structures that emerge from market dynamics. It is shown that this conceptualization can capture the market dynamics that are needed to simulate a dynamic supply chain. © 2015 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.},

The third notion of supply chain flexibility considers it as an extension of flexibility of individual nodes in the supply chain. The fourth perception of flexibility views the flexibility within supply chain in terms of the flexibility of choosing and managing the structural relationships. Finally, the fifth perception of supply chain flexibility considers it as a performance metric in the supply chain.

@article{Biswas2017194,
 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify, analyze, and categorize the major enablers of reconfigurability that can facilitate structural changes within a supply chain in a global scenario. The paper also addresses five reconfigurability dimensions in the perspective of supply chains and the major enablers to attain them. The paper further aims to understand the mutual interactions among these enablers through the identification of hierarchical relationships among them. Design/methodology/approach: A framework that holistically considers all the major enablers of reconfigurability has been developed. The hierarchical interrelationships between major enablers have been presented and interpreted using a novel qualitative modeling technique, i.e., total interpretive structural modeling (TISM), which is an extension of ISM. SPSS 22.0 is employed to carry out a one-tailed one-sample t-test further to test the hypotheses for validating the results of TISM. Impact matrix cross-reference multiplication applied to a classification (MICMAC) analysis has been employed to identify the driving and dependence powers of these reconfigurability enablers. Findings: In this paper, 15 enablers for reconfigurability paradigm have been identified through literature review and expert opinions. The authors established interrelationships and interdependencies among these enablers and categorized them as enablers of each dimension. New product development and customer satisfaction come at the highest level of priority. The levels of these enablers were obtained using TISM. The authors compared the results with the clusters derived from MICMAC analysis, and the results are found to be well within the acceptable range. Research limitations/implications: The study has implications for both practitioners and academia. The work provides a comprehensive list of enablers that are relevant to reconfigure supply chains in today’s volatile global market. This research will also help decision makers to strategically focus on the top-level enablers and their concerned dimensions. The research is based on an automobile company case study and can be extended to products with volatile and changing demands. Originality/value: The proposed model for reconfigurability enablers using TISM is a new effort altogether in the area of supply chain management. The novelty of this research lies in its identification of specific enablers to reconfigure a supply chain through different dimensions. © 2017, 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to assess supply chain reconfigurability in a global scenario. The paper attempts to measure comprehensive relative reconfigurability index (CRRI) in an automobile case supply chain by holistically considering fifteen enablers of reconfigurability. The present research evaluates CRRI by utilizing two distinct assessment models that calculate relative reconfigurability index (RRI). Firstly, a deterministic assessment model is developed from the total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) digraph, and secondly, an integrated assessment methodology that utilizes both the Delphi technique and the additive weighting method to calculate RRI. The uniqueness of the present research is to quantify reconfigurability in the case supply chain by a numerical index termed as CRRI. The paper analyzes the level of reconfigurability competence of the case supply chain in comparison with an ideal supply chain and thus facilitates structural flexibility. The proposed model for calculating CRRI, using two methodologies and comparing the results, is an innovative way of measuring supply chain reconfigurability. Supply chain's preparedness to structurally change in the present business environment of uncertainty and turbulence can be evaluated and it would act as an aide in decision making pertaining to reconfigurability in supply chains. © 2019},

 abstract = {At the time of instability becomes the norm (climate changes, natural disasters, epidemic, etc.) the management of collaborative networks, such as supply chains, is becoming more and more complex and critical. This instability only adds to the complexity of an already very complex system. Thus, supply chain managers have to adapt to multi-dimensional complex situations. Dealing with instability is a key expectation for these managers. One tool to help managers make decisions in this unstable environment is simulation. This article introduces some first results on an “atomic” reconfigurable supply chain simulation model based on Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model. This simulation tool will be used to apply an innovative physics-based approach of risk and opportunity management, that designs disturbances by forces moving the considered supply chain within its performance framework.

 abstract = {Flexibility in supply chain networks dealing with uncertainty, has become a research challenge over the past years. This work proposes a flexible supply chain network design (SCND) model that uses generalized production/warehousing nodes instead of individual production plants and warehouses while conquers with demand uncertainty using a scenario-based approach. It also deals with inventory management and decisions on strategical and tactical level (facility location, production rate, warehouse capacity, demand allocation between generalized nodes, inventory levels, product flows, suppliers’ product availability and links between all facilities). The proposed Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model allows intra-layer flows between generalized nodes and aims at minimizing total network cost. A case study is formed to test the applicability of the model for a medium sized European company. A comparison was made between a classic supply chain network and generalized network that deals with uncertainty. Results have revealed cost benefits for this model, making it not only applicable, but also cost effective for the company that will apply it. This decision support system, can help managers in taking strategic decisions such as facility location, with a higher level of accuracy. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

Hence, they must react to changes in order to adapt quickly its network. In this paper we focus on a two echelon supply chain problem dealing with supplier selection issue during periods in a highly flexible context. How to select suppliers is the main question we try to answer in this research. A suggested approach based on dynamic optimization is highlighted to solve this problem. Copyright © 2014 SCITEPRESS.},

 abstract = {Natural disasters can wreck havoc on business operations. When civil unrest swept the UK in August 2011, the effect on business was stark, losing the retail sector £300m in unexpected costs and lost revenues. On the other side of the world, the natural disaster that hit Japan in early 2011 is estimated to have run up costs in the region of £189bn in repairs. Beyond this, the earthquake and its aftermath shattered supply chains, with technology companies expecting delays of up to six months before business could resume fully. It is impossible to predict incidents like these, but businesses can help mitigate disruption in the supply chain by undertaking business continuity management (BCM). A flexible supply chain is essential when it comes to BCM - whether it means being able to cope with altering transport routes at short notice, or finding or replacing a supplier at the last minute. Understanding the supply chain is critical when responding to major impacts that affect supply chains in multiple points - like IT system failures and country-wide fuel strikes. Businesses should carry out detailed business impact assessments and risk assessments right across the end-to-end supply chain and not just at key single points of failure. It is an intensive process that needs dedicated resources and ownership at the highest level. Recognising this, DHL has designed a 10-step process, which it has implemented across its global supply chain business. This paper provides an overview of what a supply chain really looks like, what can cause disruptions and how far up/down the supply chain companies need to go with their BCM planning.},

 abstract = {Purpose: Short product life cycle and/or mass customization necessitate reconfiguration of operational enablers of supply chain (SC) from time to time in order to harness high levels of performance. The purpose of this paper is to identify the key operational enablers under stochastic environment on which practitioner should focus while reconfiguring a SC network. Design/methodology/approach: The paper used interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach that presents a hierarchy-based model and the mutual relationships among the enablers. The contextual relationship needed for developing structural self-interaction matrix (SSIM) among various enablers is realized by conducting experiments through simulation of a hypothetical SC network. Findings: The research identifies various operational enablers having a high driving power towards assumed performance measures. In this regard, these enablers require maximum attention and of strategic importance while reconfiguring SC. Practical implications: ISM provides a useful tool to the SC managers to strategically adopt and focus on the key enablers which have comparatively greater potential in enhancing the SC performance under given operational settings. Originality/value: The present research realizes the importance of SC flexibility under the premise of reconfiguration of the operational units in order to harness high value of SC performance. Given the resulting digraph through ISM, the decision maker can focus the key enablers for effective reconfiguration. The study is one of the first efforts that develop contextual relations among operational enablers for SSIM matrix through integration of discrete event simulation to ISM. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a multi-agent modelling approach that supports supply network configuration decisions towards sustaining operations excellence in terms of economic, business continuity and environmental performance. Two types of agents are employed, namely, physical agents to represent supply entities and auxiliary agents to deal with supply network configuration decisions. While using the evolutionary algorithm, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II to optimize both cost and lead time at the supply network level, agents are modelled with an architecture which consists of decision-making, learning and communication modules. The physical agents make decisions considering varying situations to suit specific product-market profiles thereby generating alternative supply network configurations. These supply network configurations are then evaluated against a set of performance metrics, including the energy consumption of the supply chain processes concerned and the transportation distances between supply entities. Simulation results generated through the application of this approach to a refrigerator production network show that the selected supply network configurations are capable of meeting intended sustainable goals while catering to the respective product-market profiles. © 2018 IEEE.},

This paper discussed how a responsive the supplier selection answer for above challenges in terms of exact and crisp solutions which are harder to achieve. The decision making in selecting suppliers and obtaining raw material, in the case of responding the demand more quickly, facing several options and is a critical decision, is often based solely on the intuition of decision makers. An intuitionistic fuzzy hedge formulation and modeling were setup for obtaining rules to ensure and to allow supplier selection with the considerations of intuitionistic approach on relevant parameters. Modeling stage encompasses the determination of variables which influence the supplier selection, constructing membership and non-membership function in which the rule of the model affecting formulation of intuitionistic fuzzy hedges in details, rule construction and comparing verification result with conventional association rule mining (ARM).

However, a lack of integration spanning these individual frameworks can be observed. In this conceptual paper, we hypothesize that reconfigurability can be considered such an integral perspective that consolidates the research in SC adaptation to ever changing environments. We theorize a new notion – a Reconfigurable SC or the X-network–that exhibits some crucial design and control characteristics for complex value-adding systems in highly vulnerable environments. We support our argumentation and conceptual viewpoints by a literature analysis along with tertiary studies to review and structure contextual factors of designing the X-networks. We propose respective frameworks and discuss the implementation principles and technologies at the macro and micro levels. Two novel concepts–dynamic SC meta-structures and dynamic autonomous services–are introduced. Distinctively, we go beyond the existing knowledge to predict proactively the future directions in the reconfigurable SCs.

 abstract = {Over the years, supply chain reconfiguration decisions have been solely based on operational risk. Simplification strategies, such as horizontal mergers, and networking strategies, such as risk pooling, are conflicting paradigms that have been shown to improve financial performance of supply partners. The implication of this to disruption risk is not fully known, especially as it concerns information security breach (ISB). Analysts have rated ISB as a huge disruption risk, costing businesses millions of dollars. Using a credible and well-established agent-based simulation approach and statistical analysis, we examine the impact of ISB on the simplification and risk pooling strategies respectively under three different order replenishment systems. The effect of reconfiguring the supply chain is first examined in a non-security breach scenario and then in a breached scenario. We find that reconfiguration has no benefit to a supply chain using a parameter based replenishment policy (option I), in both breach and non-breach situations, but leads to significant advantage when batch ordering model (option II) or a combined batch-and-parameter based ordering policy (option III) is used. We also established that batch ordering system favours the risk pooling strategy whereas a combined batch-and-parameter ordering system favours the simplification counterpart especially when the simplification is at the wholesaler tier. This study has significant implications for supply chain design as well as information security priorities. This is one of the first papers to look at how ISB impacts supply chain configuration and the role of ordering decision context. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, a framework to enable flexible global supply chain operational planning in stochastic environments is presented. In order to cope with unexpected events like natural or man-made disasters, flexible international long-distance transportation modes and postponement strategies are taken into account in our supply chain model. In order to balance supply chain costs and the flexibility of supply chains, a two-stage multi-scenario stochastic programming model is developed where the stochastic events are represented by corresponding scenarios. High quality solutions of all our problem instances are generated by using a Python based stochastic programming framework to solve the model.

 abstract = {This paper investigates the application of diverse transportation modes for a global supply chain (SC) in stochastic environments. The motivation of our paper is to investigate the idea of enabling a global flexible SC with disruptive risks in making it less vulnerable by applying diverse transportation modes which is also our first contribution. The flexibility stems from the fact that transportation modes with a low-speed transportation contain latent time buffers that can be used by accelerating transport activities. This represents a promising approach to make supply chains (SCs) more flexible and to establish an additional degree of freedom in order to manage stochastic events like minor disruptions or serious catastrophes. In this paper, a stochastic programming model for a multi-stage multi-product SC is developed. SC partners, including multiple suppliers, a processing center, two assembling centers, multiple distribution centers and retailers, are incorporated into the model. The second contribution of this paper is that different types of possible future catastrophic disruptions are quantified and included in the model. SC catastrophic disruptions like transportation delays or the fact that a SC node is disrupted by a serious catastrophe are stochastic factors of our model. The model is solved by using PySP, a specific modeling and stochastic programming framework. In order to show the quality of solutions of the stochastic programming model (SP solutions), a large amount of scenarios is generated to simulate the real case for each instance. The expected SC costs for these scenarios will be evaluated based on SP solutions and wait-and-see solutions, which are benchmarks. In addition, decision makers with neutral, optimistic and pessimistic attitudes regarding the occurrence of disruptions are also simulated and evaluated in the computational experiments. Managerial insights are concluded from computational results. The most important conclusion is that proper transportation mode planning enables a flexible global supply chain. Further conclusions like the quality of stochastic solutions and solutions of simulating decision makers with neutral, optimistic and pessimistic attitudes, as well as the most beneficial transportation modes in SCs with uncertain environments are proposed based on the computational results. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Worldwide competition originated the development of integrated supply chains (SCs) that are distributed manufacturing systems integrating international logistics and information technologies with production. This paper develops a decision-making model based on discrete consensus in order to assign tasks to each actor of the SC at the operational level. In particular, some actors of the SC generate tasks that other actors, localized in a downstream stage, have to complete. We provide a novel distributed algorithm that aims to minimize the task costs assuming that each actor can perform a subset of the available tasks and can communicate with a subset of actors. In order to show the effectiveness of the distributed algorithm, a case study is considered. The problem is formalized as a distributed consensus algorithm, i.e., as a procedure using which the agents of the SC can exchange messages and update autonomously and iteratively their assigned tasks. Some results prove that the convergence to a task assignment consensus is reached in finite time and a stopping criterion is provided. © 2012 IFAC.},

 abstract = {We address the dynamic design of supply chain networks in which the moments of demand distribution function are uncertain and facilities’ availability is stochastic because of possible disruptions. To incorporate the existing stochasticity in our dynamic problem, we develop a multi-stage stochastic program to specify the optimal location, capacity, inventory, and allocation decisions. Further, a data-driven rolling horizon approach is developed to use observations of the random parameters in the stochastic optimization problem. In contrast to traditional stochastic programming approaches that are valid only for a limited number of scenarios, the rolling horizon approach makes the determined decisions by the stochastic program implementable in practice and evaluates them. The stochastic program is presented as a quadratic conic optimization, and to generate an efficient scenario tree, a forward scenario tree construction technique is employed. An extensive numerical study is carried out to investigate the applicability of the presented model and rolling horizon procedure, the efficiency of risk-measurement policies, and the performance of the scenario tree construction technique. Several key practical and managerial insights related to the dynamic supply chain network design under uncertainty are gained based on the computational results. © 2020 The Authors.

 abstract = {This paper provides a review of the literature while contributing to academic understanding of the concepts of agility and flexibility within the supply chain. The research identified 83 peer-reviewed articles through a structured review technique, which is based on a three-stage refinement process. Data reduction procedures using codification, sentence strings and a review of keywords, title, abstract and conclusion were used in the search. The papers identified focused on organizational and supply chain agility and flexibility. The acknowledged gaps in understanding and development of agility and flexibility in supply chains were identified and categorized in terms of conceptual, contextual and methodological gaps. Subsequent to the gap analysis, this paper argues that effective relationship integration with key partners is a fundamental mechanism for mitigating the problem of control dissipation, which has hindered academic understanding with respect to development and application of agile and flexible capabilities in supply chains. The findings in this paper will help academics to gain a better understanding and to develop the concepts of supply chain agility and flexibility. In addition, the findings indicate that supply chain stakeholders need to address the issue of relationship integration when undertaking, or participating in agility and flexibility development programmes, so as to maximize supply chain performance. The paper concludes by highlighting implications for managers and researchers, and proposes a number of areas for future investigation. © 2016 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

To take advantage of available opportunities for different actors and locations, companies need to effectively transfer production. Design/methodology/approach-The case studied was a transfer of production between The Netherlands and Sweden. The case was selected based on the opportunity it provided to perform a longitudinal study of an ongoing production transfer. Findings-Different flexibility dimensions have different importance depending on the receiver or sender. A production transfer can be divided into four parts: knowledge, physical, administrative and supply chain transfer. The manufacturing flexibility have a high impact on the physical and knowledge transfer, the new product development dimension also have a major impact on the administrative transfer in combination with the supply chain flexibility dimension IT. The supply chain transfer was impacted by the supply chain flexibility dimensions except IT. Practical implications-The paper presents a first step towards a tool for analysing the strength and weaknesses within units in relation to receiving/sending production. Furthermore, that the production transfer should be viewed as four parts with interdependencies help to identify the order of the transfer process.

In ICT product supply chains, disruptions are often observed as vulnerabilities discovered in components used in the products. The vulnerabilities can be associated with the components themselves as well as with suppliers, and they can be averted by patching and supply chain reconfiguration. The paper elaborates a simulation model for analyzing relationships between the cost of treating the vulnerabilities and the supply chain configuration. We show that flexible supply chain configurations have the lowest cost and are the most resilient to vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities associated with suppliers, for example, due to the loss of their trustworthiness, cause more-significant fluctuations in supply chain performance than the vulnerabilities associated with individual components. The monitoring cost have a significant impact on the selection of the most-resilient configuration. © 2020 IEEE.},

This paper addressed some new aspects of the subject and achieved robust results by considering five objective functions. These five functions are as follows: minimization of production line disruptions due to the performance of suppliers, minimization of the complaints of production line about supplied parts, minimization of defective parts received from suppliers (PPM), maximization of on-time delivery services, and minimization of overall costs of supplied parts. Reviewing the literature, the originality of this study are as follows: 1) identifying the structure of a supply chain (SC) in general and particularly in an automobile industry SC; 2) investigating the modeling techniques of the existing SC models for coordinating all the members of a product SC; 3) building a hybrid model of IVFRN-BWM and a robust goal programming agile and flexible supply chain in an uncertain situation; and 4) identifying the suitable scenarios/cases for testing the proposed models to validate the models.

 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide evidence on the impact of network flexibility and its ambidextrous influence on a firm's exploratory and exploitative partnership selection. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop our hypotheses based on the literature of network flexibility and draw on a sample of publicly listed firms in Taiwan semiconductor and optoelectronics industries. The authors collect our data from survey questionnaires and archival sources and examine our hypotheses by using the generalized linear model (GLM) approach. Findings: The authors’ empirical findings show that configuration flexibility has a greater influence on exploratory partnerships, while manufacturing flexibility has a greater impact on exploitative partnerships. In addition, when firms are ambidextrous (i.e. have both types of flexibility), they are able to simultaneously obtain both exploratory and exploitative partnerships. The authors’ findings indicate that balancing network flexibility is critical when firms execute ambidextrous alliance strategies. Research limitations/implications: The authors’ use of survey data to measure network flexibility may limit our observations related to network evolution. In addition, the authors’ use of public annual reports to capture firm partnerships may cause us to ignore informal relationships between partners. Practical implications: The authors’ empirical findings suggest that the types of partnerships firms develop depend on which types of flexibility they possess. The results further suggest that decision makers have to find a way to develop a balanced strategy between network configuration and manufacturing flexibility when they would like to develop an ambidextrous alliance strategy. Originality/value: The authors’ study advances the understanding in the literature on supply chain flexibility and its ambidexterity by connecting network flexibility and ambidextrous alliance strategy. The authors offer a guide to supply chain managers in the area of network design. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Purpose: The stable relationship of one-supplier-one-customer is replaced by a dynamic relationship of multi-supplier-multi-customer in current market gradually, and efficient scheduling techniques are important tools of the dynamic supply chain relationship establishing process. This paper studies the optimization of the integrated planning and scheduling problem of a two-stage supply chain with multiple manufacturers and multiple retailers to obtain a minimum supply chain operating cost, whose manufacturers have different production capacities, holding and producing cost rates, transportation costs to retailers. Design/methodology/approach: As a complex task allocation and scheduling problem, this paper sets up an INLP model for it and designs a Unit Cost Adjusting (UCA) heuristic algorithm that adjust the suppliers’ supplying quantity according to their unit costs step by step to solve the model. Findings: Relying on the contrasting analysis between the UCA and the Lingo solvers for optimizing many numerical experiments, results show that the INLP model and the UCA algorithm can obtain its near optimal solution of the two-stage supply chain’s planning and scheduling problem within very short CPU time. Research limitations/implications: The proposed UCA heuristic can easily help managers to optimizing the two-stage supply chain scheduling problems which doesn’t include the delivery time and batch of orders. For two-stage supply chains are the most common form of actual commercial relationships, so to make some modification and study on the UCA heuristic should be able to optimize the integrated planning and scheduling problems of a supply chain with more reality constraints. Originality/value: This research proposes an innovative UCA heuristic for optimizing the integrated planning and scheduling problem of two-stage supply chains with the constraints of suppliers’ production capacity and the orders’ delivering time, and has a great practical significance to the dynamic relationship establishment of multi-supplier-multi-customer in current market. © 2014 Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

 abstract = {We consider a dynamic food supply chain with multiple process steps where the decisions at each step include supplier selection and settings for their process parameters. We assume that the resulting quality level of the product at every step is stochastic. We also consider that this quality level at each supply chain step has a minimum accepted level and any product that does not meet the minimum accepted level is rejected. We propose an integrated approach that uses Big Data mining techniques to study the effect of these decisions on the quality of the final product and determine our state transition matrix. From there, stochastic optimization methods are implemented to find an optimal policy describing the preferred suppliers and settings for their process parameters. The goal of this policy is to maximize the supply chain's expected profit and reduce rejected product. We show how this technique outperforms traditional techniques in running time as the problem's complexity (state and action space size) grows. We also conduct experiments to explore how the optimal policy changes as the quality threshold for acceptance becomes more restrictive and exhibits a convex behavior. © 2020},

Enterprises try to cooperate in different configurations enabling an increase in value added. Since the basic processes forming the usefulness of form, place and time are production operations and logistic processes, hence cooperation in these two task areas is increasingly essential. Therefore, subcontracting of production and logistic tasks is an essential factor determining the structure of contemporary supply chains which are called network chains. The resistance of network supply chains to disruptions is the same important exploratory area. Moreover, from the perspective of individual chain links forming a network supply chain, an essential issue is the skill of adapting itself to variable conditions of the environment and changes in the structure of the chain itself.

The objective of this article is to design a reconfigurable supply chain network by optimizing inventory allocation and transportation routing. A two-stage programming is composed according to Benders decomposition by allocating inventory in advance and anticipating the changes of transportation routings; thus the transportation routing is stochastic in nature. In addition, the fuzzy shortest path is developed to solve the problem complexity in terms of the multi-criteria of lead time and capacity with an efficient computational method. The results and analysis indicate that the proposed two-stage programming with fuzzy shortest path surpasses the performance of shortest path problem with time windows and capacity constraint (SPPTWCC) in terms of less computational time and CPU memory consumption.

 abstract = {Today, there are growing challenges on business environment because of increase in competition and customer expectations.selection of supplier and later order allocation is an essential subject matter in the area of supply chains. An well-ordered and flexible supply chain allows the firm to choose the correct suppliers at the right time for the right kind of materials, with reduced purchase cost, thereby improving competitiveness. Supply chains have the basic characteristics like multiple conflicting criteria, demand uncertainties, lead time and delivery uncertainties. In the literature isolated studies on supplier selection using mathematical models, multiple criteria decision making techniques and multiple stakeholder requirements are commonly found. Integration of these aspects give promising results. The correlated Analytic Hierarchy (CAHP) considers the correlation effect between criteria in the Analytic Hierarchy process. Linear physical programming (LPP) is a multi-objective optimization method that develops an aggregate objective function of the criteria in a piecewise, goal-programming fashion. LPP model enables decision maker to think about multiple criteria (i.e., cost, customer service, and rejections) and to express criteria preferences in terms of degrees of desirability. This paper proposes an integrated method for dealing with such problems using correlated Analytic Hierarchy- and linear physical programming techniques. The method proposed demonstrates selection of appropriate suppliers and allocates orders optimally among them.finally model calculation is presented. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {In recent years, supply chains seem to be moving more towards reconfiguring their networks to become more profitable. In the times of COVID-19, where the whole supply chains have been disrupted, suppliers are unable to supply, and manufacturers are unable to manufacture because of lockdowns in the various regions around the world. This pandemic can be compared to past earthquakes and tsunamis, as the coronavirus is also a natural disaster. Due to these past disruptions, organizations have taken many precautions and developed risk mitigation strategies to manage them. Because the COVID-19 outbreak shows the importance of new business perspectives like repurposing a viability strategy, that comes with sustainability and reconfigurability. Where reconfiguration focuses on adaptation, which directly means changes in resources and capabilities and repurposing focuses on a quick response solution to address the shortage. In this paper, a study has been done in two phases to model viability in an automobile supply chain during the COVID-19 times. In the first phase, a hybrid Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach is used to get the best criteria and alternatives with sustainability and reconfigurability under consideration. The multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) model has been developed in the second phase. Suppliers' weight that is obtained will be used to get the optimal order and allocation. This model will help develop supply chain strategies to cope with situations that hinder the firm's competitiveness.

 abstract = {Supply chain integration (SCI) and reconfiguration (SCR) are two primary approaches in recent supply chain management. However, their conflicting mechanisms and axioms have engendered two branches of research. This study, based on the concept of ambidexterity, argues that pursuing SCI and SCR simultaneously as the ambidextrous management of supply chain (AMSC) is key to manufacturers to gain superior performance. Based on the dynamic capabilities view (DCV), this paper identities data analysis capability and organizational mindfulness as important drivers of the AMSC. Based on 333 samples of Taiwanese manufacturing firms, our findings demonstrate that the AMSC has a positive effect on the manufacturer performance. Data analysis capability and organizational mindfulness can support a manufacturing firm to sense environment and to facilitate the AMSC. Although research on SCI and SCR has advanced over the past years, less studies reconcile such two contradicting approaches. By considering SCI and SCR depth in terms of their mechanisms and axioms, this study clarifies the relationship between SCI and SCR and shows their effects on the manufacturer performance. Furthermore, this study extends the DCV by showing that data analysis capability and organizational mindfulness are key to foster dynamic capabilities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Two categories of auction mechanisms, single-winner or multi-winner auction, are used in this paper. A multi-agent model is developed to study these four categories of supply chains. The results of experiments show that, with the decrease of safety stock, the tendencies of the retailer's profit are changed under different structures. Also, the optimal (near-optimal) safety stock, corresponding to the maximum profit, shows significant difference under different structures. The results of this paper demonstrate that the safety stock can be significantly changed and financial benefits can be achieved while working under different supply chain structures with (T, S) strategy. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.},

However, this tendency of supply chain network complexity intensifies the uncertainty of supply chain network's operating environment; any node in the supply chain network occurs unexpected incident which will soon affect the associated upstream and downstream enterprises and then affect the all enterprises on the network. For cascading problems of supply chain, this study proposed a capacity reallocation strategy with local and global information integrated. Based on this strategy, three attacking methods were adopted to simulate emergency events of supply chain and the vulnerability of supply chain network is measured through maximum connected subgraph and network efficiency. The experimental results show that the reallocation strategy put forward is practical and highly efficient. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

 abstract = {Supply chain viability concerns the entire supply system rather than one company or one single chain to survive COVID-19 disruptions. Mobility restriction and overall demand decline lead to systematically cascading disruptions that are more severe and longer lasting than those caused by natural disasters and political conflicts. In the present study, the authors find that large companies and manufacturers with traditional advantages suffer greater losses than small ones, which is conceptualized as the “Hub Paradox” by empirically investigating one Warp Knitting Industrial Zone of China. An underload cascading failure model is employed to simulate supply chain viability under disruptions. Numerical simulations demonstrate that when the load decreases beyond a threshold, the viability will drop down critically. Besides, supply chain viability depends on two aspects: the adaptive capability of the manufacturers themselves and the adaptive capability of the connections of the supply network. The comparison study demonstrates that enhancing cooperative relations between hub and non-hub manufacturers will facilitate the entire supply network viability. The present study sheds light on viable supply chain management. Compared with conventionally linear or resilient supply chains, intertwined supply networks can leverage viability with higher adaptation of redistributing production capacities among manufacturers to re-establish overall scale advantages. Finally, the present study also suggests solving the “Hub Paradox” from the perspective of complex adaptive system. © 2022, The Author(s).},

 abstract = {Robustness of a supply network highly depends on its structure. Although structural design methods have been proposed to create supply networks with optimal robustness, a real-life supply network can be quite different from these optimal structural designs. Meanwhile, real cases such as Thailand floods and Tohoku earthquake demonstrate the vulnerability of supply networks in real life. Obviously, it is urgent to enhance the robustness of existing real-life supply networks. Thus, in this paper, a supply network reconfiguration method based on adaptive variable neighborhood search (AVNS) is proposed to enhance the structural robustness of supply networks facing both random and target disruptions. Firstly, a supply network model considering the heterogeneous roles of entities is introduced. Based on the model, two robustness metrics, Rr and Rt, are proposed to describe the tolerance of supply networks facing random and target disruptions, respectively. Then, the problem of reconfiguration-based supply network robustness enhancement is described. To solve the problem effectively and efficiently, a new heuristic based on general variable neighborhood search, namely, AVNS, is proposed. Finally, a case study based on three real-life supply networks is presented to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed robustness enhancing method. © 2020 Ping Lou et al.},

@article{Mackay2019,
 abstract = {As disruptions and uncertainty have become emergent themes within the supply chain literature, attention has shifted towards the choices enacted to combat the negative effects of disruptions. Extant research highlights the importance of system states–namely robustness and resilience–towards mitigating the probability and magnitude of disruptions, however, there appears to be a lack of conceptual guidance surrounding two popular strategies–redundancy and flexibility–that have been proposed to mitigate the impact of disruptions. To address this issue, we review and investigate contextual factors from empirical research that may offer insight into conceptual strategies that can be utilised to improve post-disruption system performance utilising a methodology based upon an abductive approach to conceptual theory building. In this paper published research on resilience and robustness in supply chains is considered, alongside research in other areas such as risk, systems theory, and ecology. Inference drawn from empirical research is often highly contextualised, but collectively highlights unique generalisable factors. Our research proposes four broad conceptual strategies–insurance, expediting, strategic adaptive capability and reconfiguration–that each uniquely serve to reduce the probability and magnitude of supply chain disruptions. Our research concludes that the difference in utility between redundancy and flexibility as means to enhance resilience and robustness is influenced by interactions between the supply chain, the disruption characteristics (inclusive of speed of onset and time horizon) and the decision maker. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

 abstract = {The most common solutions to protect the supply chains for disruptions are increasing inventory, adding capacity, and using multiple suppliers. While these approaches in general prove to solve the disruption problem, they come with a negative effect on cost per product and cost of capital. In a highly volatile demand environment with fast pace changing technology, increasing inventory can constitute a big risk for obsolesce, hence additional measures are needed to create a competitive business advantage with such a supply chain. Furthermore, when competing about the same sources, as in the case of semiconductors, Operations Executives need to be able to respond fast when supply issues occur, in order to minimize the potential impact from a disruption. The ability to react and response to a disruption is enhanced with Supply chain risk tools utilizing the most recent technologies, such as Control Tower solutions enabling End-to End monitoring and transparency. However, even with the help of such technology, the decision maker will still be reactive and can merely respond to occurrences. To reach the next level of responsiveness, additional layer of intelligence is needed in the supply chain solution. From the available literature about Supply Chain Resilience, and similar advanced supply chain solutions, we can conclude that the main focus of research has so far been on the demand side, i.e., how to enhance forecast management. There are thus few practical and academic contributions on how to manage the supply side or more precise on how to manage the Inbound Supply Chain in a volatile business environment. The purpose of this paper is to investigate what factors that are crucial to regard when creating a proactive and responsive Inbound Supply Chain. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.},

 abstract = {Purpose -The conceptualization of flexibility in organizations historically emerged from three views which relate to economic, to organizational and to manufacturing perspectives. Despite the growing number of publications about supply chain flexibility in the area of supply chain management, there is a lack of consensus on how to define and to conceptualize supply chain flexibility froma management point of view. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview of the literature on the supply chain flexibility perspective and contributes to our understanding of the current state of research and its future development. Design/methodology/approach -The researchmethodology used is the systematic literature review. In total 92 articles were selected from databases of well-known journal publishers in the field of economics, business studies and management sciences as well as grey literature to cover the topic of supply chain flexibility. Findings -A limited number of studies in the field of supply chain flexibility apply theories and define the term supply chain flexibility. Instead they focus on a particular part or dimension of the supply chain. Based on the analysis, a distinction is made between flexibility in the supply chain and supply chain flexibility. Based on the function and characteristics of the supply chain, the authors selected 30 flexibility dimensions that cover supply chain flexibility by concentrating on the different business areas involved. Research limitations/implications -The results support researchers and practitioners by identifying relevant trends and gaps in the field of supply chain flexibility. Originality/value -The authors review the dimensions and aspects of supply chain flexibility that are currently taken into account in the literature. In this way, the authors provide an overarching perspective on the flexibility literature relating to supply chains. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, it is necessary to paying attention to the opportunities and threats in the field of industry and trade, and evaluate the ability of industries and companies in dealing with uncertainties and existing risks, and it is very important to manage supply chain risk. The main purpose of this study is to be careful against risky suppliers and reducing the injury rate in the event of a disruption. Therefore, in this regard, a multi-stage mixed integer programming model with a proactive approach has been used; that in the first stage, the model reports the amount of supply from suppliers without considering the risk criterion, and at the same time, it seeks to optimal state of minimization the supply chain costs (including purchase cost, shipping, maintenance, supplier selection and return goods). In the second stage, after the suppliers which supplying the parts, have been identified, the model seeks to minimize the identified risks of suppliers under different scenarios. In the third stage, the model tries to achieve an optimal state of supplying the parts from less risky suppliers. In the continuation of this study, an integrated multi-objective programming model has been designed, which will be solved by the epsilon constraint method, and the best output will be reported from the Pareto’s optimal set of answers; Finally the results of the model will be compared in two multi-stage and integrated multi-objective modes and the correctness of the performance is confirmed. © 2021 KIIE},

 abstract = {Supply chain flexibility (SCF) represents the capability of firms to respond to unanticipated changes in customer needs and competitor actions. Given the growing research interest in flexibility strategies, the development of a valid and reliable instrument to measure organizational responses toward environmental uncertainties or risks is imperative. However, no systematic and scientific research has been conducted to develop such an instrument. The present study adopts a comprehensive and rigorous procedure to develop a multifaceted scale for SCF through an empirical investigation. The results of a confirmatory factor analysis suggest that SCF can be operationalized as a second-order factor model comprising four dimensions, namely: sourcing flexibility, operating system flexibility, distribution flexibility, and information system flexibility. A series of goodness-of-fit indices further demonstrates that this scale is internally consistent, reliable, and valid. The various findings suggested in the present study provide a more succinct picture of SCF, and the well-validated scale could be used as a basis for further research and theoretical groundwork in the field of supply chain management. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve this understanding, it is not only important to have a good understanding of individual firm’s manufacturing flexibility next to supply chain flexibility, but also to consider the internal (among production network’s facilities) and external (other tiers of supply chain) relationships in a production network. Studying the production network’s flexibility dimensions facilitates the effective use of the synergy of cooperation in the network. On other words, the potential in the network structure cannot be exploited unless the planning and control of network consider the available flexibility of network and operationalize the opportunities which arise. This paper identifies different dimensions of flexibility in a production network and describes how they can support firms in responding to customers’ needs. This research employs exploratory and descriptive approaches and uses a single case study of Norwegian diary to capture the dynamics of production networks. Three product categories with different network characteristics are selected, and the identified network flexibility dimensions are investigated for these products.

 abstract = {The electric mobility market is characterized by demand volatility and a changing supply chain with new to the industry suppliers. In order to cope with demand volatility, the production capacities must be synchronized with external supply chain partners through changeability and flexibility measures. We define flexibility as the ability to quickly react to changing demand volumes within the current supply chain and production structure. Changeability needs further investments to adapt to the changing environment. This paper presents a method for the design of flexible and changeable supply chains, predicated on an examination of two companies’ production systems and two different supply contract designs. We consider a quantity flexibility contract and a new developed contracting matrix. The method is being validated by a prototypical application in the production of electrified automotive powertrains. The results show an increase in supply chain flexibility for the quantity flexibility contract and we are able to introduce a changeable supply chain with the use of the contracting matrix. © 2019 The Authors.

 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of three important relational capabilities – absorptive capacity (AC), transactive memory systems (TMS), and organisational interoperability (OI); on the flexibility of buyer-supplier relationships and performance in retail supply chains. Drawing on the relational view of strategic management, the impact of relational capabilities on two forms of supply chain flexibility is examined – configuration flexibility (CF) for switching suppliers with minimal penalties, and planning and control flexibility (PCF) for altering supply schedules, quality, and delivery lead-time. Design/methodology/approach: Strategic- and tactical-level managers from 211 retail stores in the UK were surveyed. The authors validated a measurement model with structural equation modelling and tested four hypotheses on the mediating role of relational capabilities on supply chain flexibility and retail performance, controlling for size, duration of relationship, and market segment. Findings: Results showed that the three relational capabilities partially mediated the positive effect of CF and PCF on operational performance in big middle and niche retailers. Examining the interaction effect of the forms of flexibility on the relational capabilities and performance, the authors found positive interaction effects on TMS and OI but a non-significant effect on AC. Practical implications: In addition to providing novel theoretical insights on supply chain flexibility, the findings have practical implications for supplier selection and buyer-supplier relationship management. Originality/value: Overall, the study highlights the impacts of relational capabilities on adopted operational strategies such as flexibility, buyer-supplier relationships, and retail performance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Because the supply network of an enterprise should be flexible enough to capture and overcome market dynamics, one of the major concerns of global enterprises is to make their supply network reconfigurable. Although many strategies for flexible management of a supply network have been proposed, especially for mitigating supply network risks, it still remains unclear how to apply the strategies to a supply network and how to reconfigure the supply network. This paper examines the influence of flexibility strategies in a dynamic global market environment on the structure of supply network, and proposes a method of reconfiguring the supply network of an enterprise to cope with its flexibility strategies. A reconfigurable supply network model is proposed, and flexibility strategies are classified, and critical indices of strategies are defined. In the proposed model, each business actor is defined as a network node and each node has its own goal. A node optimizes its goal to reduce and overcome the risk of market environments. The result of optimization indicates that the supply network structure is reconfigured dynamically. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {The recent Covid-19 outbreak has caused severe disruption of the global supply chain, which tests firms’ ability to survive and build resilience. The concept of adaptive supply chain management (A-SCM) has never been tested against a severe supply chain disruption, such as a pandemic. Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine how firms in Indonesia develop resilience through the implementation of components of adaptive supply chain management, namely risk management, resource reconfiguration and supply chain flexibility, in order to survive severe supply chain disruption. Research design, data and methodology: A qualitative method and PLS-SEM were used to analyze 120 data collected from Indonesian manufacturing firms in various industries. Results: The findings show that risk management, resource reconfiguration, and supply chain flexibility are important components that make up A-SCM. However, only risk management contributes to help build firm resilience in the presence of severe supply chain disruption. Conclusions: The components of A-SCM have been empirically tested. The implication is that managers should carefully use RM to prepare firms for different scenarios to develop contingency strategies. This research contributes to the supply chain management body of knowledge in the context of pandemic-level disruption and broadens the dynamic capabilities perspective. © 2020.

Due to fast and dynamic demand variations in recent times, the supply chains for outsourced components also need agility and quick reconfiguration to adapt to these challenges. For a known demand scenario, the manufacturer must select the optimum combination of suppliers to minimize the total cost of supplies as well as the transportation cost. The two objective functions developed in this model represent the minimization of the total cost of supplies including transportation and maximization of reliability of the set of suppliers. As the two objectives may have trade-offs in many instances, a set of Pareto optimal non-dominated solutions is searched using an evolutionary algorithm called self-organizing migration algorithm or SOMA.

 abstract = {The paper explores the meaning of flexibility in the context of lean, agile and leagile supply networks and articulates a supply network flexibility framework. Two key 'sources' of flexibility are investigated: vendor flexibility and sourcing flexibility. The paper introduces an extension of the 'leagility' concept beyond the simple material flow decoupling point concept. Two new types of leagility are put forward: (1) leagile with vendor flexibility systems, which combine the use of agile vendors with lean sourcing practices and (2) leagile with sourcing flexibility systems, which combine the use of lean vendors with agile sourcing practices. Case studies of two UK based specialist fashion retailers' supply networks are presented in order to gain insights into the sourcing strategies used and the sources of flexibility employed by retailers at supply network level. A new taxonomy that dynamically links vendor and sourcing flexibility with lean, agile and leagile supply network strategies is proposed. We suggest that the proposed taxonomy can be used as a guideline for firms designing and managing parallel supply pipelines that match different operating environments. The findings add to the understanding of the ways in which the two sources of supply network flexibility (vendor and sourcing) interact in practice and provide evidence of the ways in which companies can strike balances between these sources, as well as the effects that can be achieved and some of the trade-offs involved. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Enterprises in an industrial cluster could dynamically alliance in the form of cluster supply chains to share inner-cluster resources and services, and respond to the ever-fluctuating customer demands in a cost-effective way. However, an effective and feasible method enabling such dynamic cluster supply chain configuration (CSCC) lags behind practice due to the conflict of interests. Researchers are designing All-in-One theoretic models to optimize CSCC with the assumed decision details of all enterprises, while in fact clustered enterprises are seeking effective decentralized decision mechanisms which protect their decision autonomy in the frequently re-configured CSC. A newly emerged multi-disciplinary optimization method, Augmented Lagrangian Coordination (ALC), which supports the open-structure collaboration with strict optimization convergence, is thoroughly investigated in this paper and applied to solve the conflict. Through a complete analysis of CSC's configuration policies in typical stages, a generic CSCC model is proposed and then partitioned into an ALC-based decentralized decision model by the typical decision autonomy distribution in clusters. Clustered enterprises collaborate vertically and laterally along the ALC model through multi-dimensional couplings to achieve the overall consistency and optimality. Results have proved the effectiveness of ALC for CSCC problem. A set of sensitivity analysis is also conducted to find out the condition in which an order has to be fulfilled in a CSC and the most appropriate configuration. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {Resilience and flexibility in manufacturing and supply chains are widely discussed at times of the present crises situation due to COVID-19 pandemic. It is a question of ongoing debate among practitioners about the role of flexibility and complexity in building resilience for firms and their supply chains. In this research, we examine the flexible business strategies at the demand, supply, and process side of supply chains contributing to resilience. Five of the major flexible business strategies were acknowledged in this research and the single items for constructing them were posited. In this study, we observe the correlations among the constructs based on survey-based research in electronics manufacturing firms, followed by a dimensionality reduction of constructs using factor analysis. The data collected were subject to several initial tests for ensuring validity, reliability, and adequacy using relevant statistical indicators. The measurement model was converted into a structural model and path coefficients were determined. From the path analysis, the latent variables contributing to flexibility in supply chains were found to be independent estimators of resilience. Adding to it, we observe that the single items for measuring the flexibility of supply, process, product, and pricing strategies were evidenced to be strongly correlated. The results are useful to managers for taking decisions related to flexibility implementation, towards enhancing resilience in supply chains. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

In this study, supply chain network design problem is investigated and an efficient solution approach is presented. Specifically, a heuristic graph theoretic-based algorithm is proposed for solving a multi-echelon responsive supply chain network design problem with lateral-transshipment among retailers. The possibility of lateral-transshipment is considered to increase the customer satisfaction by increasing the availability of the goods, and to reduce total inventory handling costs. Consideration of lateral transshipment provides a trade-off between transportation costs and inventory handling costs at the retailers. Graph theory is used to investigate and study the structure of the supply chain network and it is shown that the network can be reduced to a k-partite graph. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with an exact commercial solver on test problems. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm generates high-quality solutions in a reasonable time in comparison with the exact solver. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

At first, the single-objective cost minimisation problem is formulated and extended as a multi-objective problem incorporating responsiveness as another objective. Pareto solutions are obtained using augmented ε-constraint (AUGMECON) method. The major inferences include: 1) the cost minimisation model opens a fewer facility under nominal condition and prefers capacity expansion strategy under disruptions; 2) the inclusion of responsiveness objective results in opening more facilities with outsourcing as preferred reactive strategy; 3) DM’s attitude significantly affect structural decisions but not the parametric decisions such as capacity expansion, material flow redirection, and outsourcing; 4) a neutral DM selects a dispersed and diversified portfolio of facilities, whereas averse DM opens backup facilities closer to critical facilities.

 abstract = {Although a responsive supply chain is an integral part of order-winning manufacturing strategies, it has not been clear how firms build a responsive supply chain in global manufacturing environments. Built upon a synthesis of the existing literature and relevant theories, this paper presents a research model that defines the drivers, strategy, and practices of a responsive supply chain and the performance outcomes. This paper is one of the rare empirical studies that identify key variables relevant to the implementation of a successful responsive supply chain. The effective implementation of a responsive supply chain requires a careful definition of a responsive supply chain strategy in terms of the product range, and the frequency and innovativeness of the product offerings. Firms also need to provide key implementation practices (i.e.; sharing of information with customers, collaboration with suppliers, use of advanced manufacturing technology) to achieve pull production to achieve responsiveness to the market. This study also suggests that the key contextual factors that influence the extent of implementation of a responsive supply chain strategy are mostly the size of firms, industry characteristics, and customer and supplier bases, rather than the location of manufacturing firms. This paper shows that the effective implementation of a responsive supply chain strategy involves the integration of inter-organizational resources (i.e.; socio-relational and techno-process integration) across the global supply chain to enhance pull production capabilities. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {This article investigates the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and their proactive mediation by adaptive operational decisions in different network design structures in anticipation of and during the pandemic. In generalized terms, we contribute to the understanding of the effect of preparedness and recovery decisions in a pandemic setting on supply chain operations and performance. In particular, we examine the impact of inventory pre-positioning in anticipation of a pandemic and the adaptation of production-ordering policy during the pandemic. Our model combines three levels, which is not often seen jointly in operations management literature, i.e., pandemic dynamics, supply chain design, and operational production-inventory control policies. The analysis is performed for both two- and three-stage supply chains and different scenarios for pandemic dynamics (i.e., uncontrolled propagation or controlled dispersal with lockdowns). Our findings suggest that two-stage supply chains exhibit a higher vulnerability in disruption cases. However, they are exposed to a lower system inertia and show positive effects at the recovery stage. Supply chain adaptation ahead of a pandemic is more advantageous than during the pandemic when specific operational recovery policies are deployed. We show that it is instructive to avoid simultaneous changes in structural network design and operational policies since that can destabilize the production-inventory system and result in higher product shortages. © 2022},

 abstract = {Supply chain (SC) is a dynamic process that entails a continuous flow of information, materials and funds across multiple functional areas, within and between chain members in order to meet customer's requirements and to maximize their profit. Such dynamic process requires instantaneous acquisition and constant re-evaluation of partners, technologies and organizational structures. However, firms may encounter problems related to the dynamic process. Petroleum companies, in this globalization era are one of the dynamic supply chain entities, which require dynamic processes of capabilities, due to their high degree of uncertainties. Motivated by the complexity of uncertainty in the petroleum companies and its typical characteristic of SC, this study intends to understand the process of dynamic SC management. Using the resource-based view and organizational learning theory as the basis for developing the framework of the study, this study aimed to identify and understand the process of dynamic SC capabilities. Company in oil and gas in Malaysia will be chosen as the sample case in understanding the process of the dynamic SC capabilities and SC performance. Due to the subjectivity of the study that requires understanding process of SC, this study proposes to employ interpretive paradigm where it would guide towards rigour qualitative methodology. This study will provide rich and thick description of the dynamic of SC where the outcome will contribute to the managerial and theoretical perspective of SC management in oil and gas industry. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

 abstract = {Supply chains suffer from serious vulnerabilities and disruptions with increasing global crises, including pandemics and natural disasters. Dynamic and complex supply chain environments have constantly led companies to modern management approaches such as resilience to address disruptions. Besides, the sustainability approach enhances the strength of the supply chain in disruptions by considering economic, social, and environmental aspects. This paper develops a mathematical model for designing a supply chain network considering resilience and sustainability. In this model, suppliers were exposed to disruption with different probabilities. The model has three objectives: minimizing total costs and maximizing suppliers' social and environmental scores. A robust scenario-based stochastic programming approach has been used for potential disruption scenarios. The multiobjective model is solved by the ϵ-constraint method in GAMS software. The numerical results show the performance of the model in a different situation. Also, the robust scenario-based stochastic programming approach allows the average performance of the supply chain in each objective to improve. © 2021 Zahra Sadeghi et al.},

 abstract = {To increase resilience in supply chains, we investigate the optimal design of flexibility in a backup system. We model the dynamics of disruptions as Markov chains, and consider a multiproduct, multisupplier supply chain under dynamic disruption risks. Using our model, we first show that a little flexibility in the backup system can go a long way in mitigating dynamic disruption risks. This raises an important and fundamental question in designing flexibility in the backup system: to achieve the benefits of full backup flexibility, which unreliable suppliers should be backed up? To answer this question, we connect the supply chain to various queueing and dam models by analyzing the dynamics of the inventory shortfall process. Using this connection, we show that backing up suppliers merely based on first moment considerations such as their average reliability or average product demand can be misleading. All else equal, it is better to back up suppliers with (1) longer but less frequent disruptions, and (2) lower demand uncertainty. In addition to such second moment effects, by employing the Renyi's Theorem, we demonstrate that when disruptions are relatively long (if they occur), backing up the suppliers for which the expected wasted backup capacity is minimum provides the best backup flexibility design. We also develop easy-to-compute and yet effective indices that (a) guide the supply chain designer in deciding which suppliers to backup, and (b) provide insights into the role of various factors such as inventory holding and shortage costs, purchasing costs, suppliers reliabilities, and product demand distributions in designing backup flexibility. © 2016 INFORMS.},

 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this research is to develop a conceptual framework in which dynamic capabilities (DCs) for the creation of logistics flexibility are outlined, and elaborate it further based on empirical data from a case study at a Swedish fast fashion retailer. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual framework that aims to delineate the relationship between generic classes of DCs and logistics flexibility is proposed. Thereafter, based on a theory elaboration approach, empirical data from a case study at a Swedish fast fashion retailer is used to identify more specific DCs and further outline the characteristics of the DCs classes. Findings: The proposed framework draws on the three DC classes of sensing, seizing and reconfiguring, and how they underscore logistics range and logistics response flexibility. The framework also distinguishes between DC classes and logistics flexibility that occur at operational, structural and strategic levels. DCs for the creation of logistics flexibility at a Swedish fast fashion retailer have also been identified and described as a means to further elaborate the characteristics of the DC classes. Research limitations/implications: Current empirical data is limited to one specific company context. Practical implications: The research presents a systematic and comprehensive map of different DCs that underscore logistics flexibility, a useful tool supporting logistics development efforts regarding flexibility. Originality/value: The establishment of a more detailed DC lens, in which different classes of DCs are included, means that an improved understanding for how flexibility is created can be achieved. It helps the research to move beyond the “here and now” existence of logistics flexibility to instead focus on how logistics flexibility can be created. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we consider the inventory problem of a firm facing disruption probability in its supply chain which consists of multiple suppliers and multiple demand nodes. The firm wishes to minimize its total expected cost in a finite time horizon setting. In order to manage the supply chain disruption, we introduce flexibility into the supply chain network of our inventory management problem. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, and a state-dependent optimal threshold policy is derived. We show that the expected cost function is monotonic in the convex ordering of the demand distribution and that the optimal policy can be characterized with the ratio of the ordering cost and the disruption probability of supply. We also numerically demonstrate that the flexibility of the supply chain network reduces the total expected cost. © The Operations Research Society of Japan.},

This study focuses on the efficient coordination of parallel, reconfigurable, inter-organizational supply operations. A novel market-based approach is introduced to support supply networks' parallel and decentralized reconfiguration.

However, the academic literature needs empirical studies on SC resilience capable of investigating the inter-organizational components of flexibility along different tiers. Therefore, this paper analyzes the main lack of flexibilities in three Brazilian automotive SCs that limit their resilience and therefore their capacity to better support and meet the demand changes in the marketplace. A multi-tier case study approach is adopted. Research findings identify lack of flexibilities in different tiers that inhibit the SC resilience as well as manufacturing and SC flexibilities that build SC resilience. The findings also highlight that the same SC may have the flexibility to be resilient for one of its products but not for another product, what sheds new lights on the academic literature. Finally, flexible SCs should be designed to increase SC resilience to cope with mishaps as significant demand changes.},

 abstract = {Supply chains often experience significant economic losses from disruptions such as facility breakdowns, transportation mishaps, natural calamities, and intentional attacks. To help respond and recover from a disruption, we investigate adjustments in order activity across four echelons including assembly. Simulation experiments reveal that the impact of a disruption depends on its location, with costlier and longer lasting impacts occurring from disruptions at echelons close to ultimate consumption. Cost functions based on system inventory and service can be quite ill-behaved in these complex problem settings. Expediting, an adaptive ordering approach often used to mitigate disruptions, can trigger unintended bullwhip effects, and hurt rather than help overall performance. As an alternative to expediting interventions, dynamic order-up-to policies show promise as an adaptive mitigation tool. We also find benefits in the dynamic policies from incorporating a metaheuristic parameter search over multiple echelons, yielding significantly better solution quality than embedded unimodal search. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The approach is based on the idea to characterise all FSN members by their functions or services and to describe them via profiles thus defining their roles. The profiles described by the application ontology are associated with agent-based services that negotiate to take into account explicit and tacit preferences of the enterprises, in order to dynamically configure a network on demand. Semantic service discovery and dynamic composition are used to accomplish this task. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

 abstract = {Agile supply chain analytics is about ability to adapt business intelligence (BI) systems to meet the changing needs of the supply network and its environment. Agile BI incorporates both technical and process-oriented approach to development, management, and delivery of BI solutions. To achieve agile BI, supply chains must provide and establish the necessary infrastructure, architecture, tools and processes in a way that enables them to deliver BI systems capable of quickly and effectively adapting to the rapidly changing business needs and environment factors. However, most supply chains still lack methods, processes and tools to successfully design and implement these systems. The paper first provides an analysis of current situation and a concise background research, followed by the introduction of the integrated and adaptive supply chain business intelligence model. This model enables design of pervasive analytical systems for collaborative decision-making, monitoring and management of the supply network. The main components of the model are described, as well as the architecture and features of the specialized supply chain intelligence web portal which demonstrates usefulness and applicability of the proposed model. This system allows creation of a new breed of flexible and agile BI systems which ultimately results in more efficient, responsive and adaptive supply chains. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

To this end, we propose a generic two-echelon supply chain with an emergency backup supplier, which is modeled using control engineering approach. The simulation study is carried out for both frequent-but-short and rare-but-long disruptions to evaluate its impact under the emergency sourcing strategy, with long-term profit and backlog of the supply chain firm as performance measures. The study provides insights into parameter settings and potential trade-offs involved in designing an emergency sourcing strategy. Further, the results for the frequent-but-short scenario show that a trade-off between improvement in service level and long-term profitability of the firm exists, which is affected by cost, response time and spare capacity of the backup supplier. As for the rare-but-long scenario, the trade-off is between preparedness and recovery actions. © 2020, © 2020 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers.},

 abstract = {Over the past two decades, the scope of some key subjects in operations management has extended beyond the single company to include supply chain (SC) partners and their interactions. One example of such an extension is the contemporary concept of supply chain flexibility (SCF). Although there has been considerable academic progress on SCF, most of the previous studies on this topic have been confined to a single firm, thereby neglecting other important aspects of a supply chain. Therefore, the development of empirical multi-tier studies capable of investigating the inter-organisational components of SCF is required. Within this context, this paper has the purpose of exploring the main effects of flexible SC capabilities or their lack at various tiers that limit the SC's ability to provide products to end-customers. The research design was a multiple case study with internal and external validity checks, within-case analysis and cross-case comparisons, based on a research framework that scrutinises the relationships between SC contextual constraints and flexibility types. The study took place in three representative SCs of the Brazilian automotive industry and sought mainly to identify and compare SC contextual constraints that hinder product delivery to end-customers. Constraints such as suppliers' capacity, diversity of suppliers, suppliers' cooperation, trust and commitment, tariffs, exchange rates and inventory were identified in different supplier tiers of the OEMs as the main factors influencing the observed volume and mix flexibilities. Additionally, SCF types such as sourcing, relational, delivery, postponement, new product and responsiveness influenced the SC's flexibility provided to the end-customers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {In order to stay responsive to evolving customer demands and to meet the need for greater product customizations, many manufacturing enterprises are recognizing the need to quickly reconfigure their manufacturing systems and supply chains. Making reconfiguration decisions requires a system-level optimization that involves many factors such as manufacturing tasks, outsourcing decisions, supply chain configurations, as well as risks. This paper proposes a graph-based cost model to optimize the configuration of manufacturing supply chain networks to support reconfiguration decision-making. An optimization model is formulated to minimize the total cost of the manufacturing enterprise with the consideration of operating cost and reconfiguration cost. To effectively quantify the reconfiguration cost, a graph-based cost model is developed to characterize the relationship between the graphical similarity of two supply chain networks and the reconfiguration cost. Outsourcing decisions and supply chain risks are also considered in the proposed model.

It may also be considered to plan strategies, in order to gain competitive edge over competitors. Recently extensive work is being reported in SCF focussing mainly on its multi dimensional aspects and implementation. However SCF is no free lunch and it may require huge investments to realise its potential benefits. 'How much flexibility is required', thus becomes the prime concern for firms willing to be flexible. This question is rarely discussed in the literature and in its scarcity, flexibility performance measurements remains untouched for risky and uncertain environments. Therefore measuring SCF is a prominent field where research needs to be focused. In this paper a mathematical model is proposed to evaluate supply chain flexibility at supplier buyer interface with an aim to attain robust supply in all possible scenarios. Further cost of procurement in view of flexibility is investigated in disastrous scenarios to support procurement decisions by managers. The paper contributes by analysing and evaluating SCF in environment of demand and lead time uncertainties and risks of major plant disruptions. © Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management 2013.},

This paper contributes by analysing supply chain disruptions in extremely risky environments that are coupled with uncertainties in demand and lead times from downstream. These uncertainties are captured by a probability density functions, more precisely the normal distributions. A flexibility measure ψ is designed which not only ensures timely supply of material from the supplier but also ensures to maintain a continuous supply at minimal risk to buyer in case of complete disruptions at supplier's production sites. As this flexibility measure ψ varies from 0 to 1, it reflects a 0 to 100% flexibility of supplier from buyers' viewpoint. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

 abstract = {Purpose – Changes are inevitable in risky and uncertain business environments of today’s volatile supply chains. The concept of flexibility originates from this need to mitigate the ill-effects of risks and uncertainty in supply chains. In this paper, an attempt is made to present an exhaustive review on supply chain flexibility (SCF) and its implementation to gain strategic advantages. Design/methodology/approach – A citation analysis method is employed in this paper to discuss, analyse and apprehend the conceptual, empirical, analytical and simulation studies done in this field. In this paper, about 110 papers on flexibility from many reputed journals are examined to study and assimilate various aspects of flexibility. Findings – SCF embraces a unified process-based view including the core processes such as procurement, sourcing, distribution and logistics and mitigates uncertainty or risks involved. The review helps to assimilate the key knowledge about relevant practices in SCF and helps to draw implementing strategies while offering managerial insight on the subject. Research limitations/implications – Citation and co-citation analysis is done to review the SCF literature. Efforts are made to investigate relevant papers from various journals regarding its ability to mitigate risk or aid in making strategic decision. The study, however, is limited to certain industries in the papers as per chosen approach here. The strategies described in here may further be verified by the researchers and practitioners pertaining to their study or industries focused. Practical implications – It provides managerial insight for practitioners on how to use flexibility within the firm and across supply chain while considering various trade-offs. Originality/value – This paper is unique as a review paper, as it encompasses various kinds of studies done on SCF from conceptual models to mathematical models. Further, it briefs with the current practices in industries/SC towards being flexible. It talks of various trade-offs in pursuit of flexibility and concludes while suggesting numerous research gaps and opening new dimensions for SCF research. It offers many managerial and academic implications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Considering the mixed results obtained from linking supplier integration with performance outcomes, a 'dynamic' component - or the ability to reconfigure the supply chain to adapt to changing environments - appears critical to creating a sustainable competitive advantage. This study identifies integration sensing, seizing and transforming as sub-capabilities that together form a dynamic capability, referred to herein as supplier integrative capability (SIC). That is, SIC enables buyers to sense changes in the supply environment by sharing information with suppliers, seize opportunities presented by establishing procedures to analyse this information and make long-term changes to existing processes. A global sample from the industrial sector reveals that the three capabilities exhibit complementarity and must exist simultaneously for the capability to be effective, which then enhances both process flexibility and cost efficiency and helps firms avoid the traditional trade-off of cost and flexibility. In addition, market and technological dynamics strengthen the effect of SIC on operational performance; supply base complexity attenuates this link. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Our study which is grounded in information processing theory argues that two mechanisms can support firms in building up sourcing flexibility. Based on a survey of 336 manufacturing firms from Europe and the U.S. and using partial least squares (PLS) modeling as well as hierarchical regression analysis, we show that supplier evaluation and selection, and the integration of information systems at the buyer-supplier interface are positively related to sourcing flexibility. Sourcing flexibility, in turn, is curvilinearly related to delivery performance. Finally, delivery performance positively influences the product's financial performance. The strong associations between sourcing flexibility, delivery performance, and product financial performance underscore that sourcing flexibility merits the attention of supply chain managers during supplier selection and purchasing decisions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Due to highly competitive market environment, the supply chain network of business organization are not only efficient but also flexible. The flexible supply chain of business organization is greatly influenced by the suppliers. Hence, the selection of suppliers has to be flexible which not only take into account the quantitative factors but also take into account qualitative factors. In this paper, a novel attempt is conceptualized to model a flexible supplier selection (FSS) problem by integrating the qualitative and quantitative models for supplier selection problem. A MINLP, a quantitative model, is considered in the proposed FSS framework where factors such as lead time, quality, supplier's capacity and transportation cost are considered. Similarly, in qualitative model factors such as loyalty, technology adaptability, CSR and environmental factors are considered. AHP and IRP, qualitative models, have been applied and compared for supplier's ranking. An integrated ranking of AHP and IRP is used for modeling FSS problem. Finally, Integration of quantitative and qualitative model provides the set of deviation which measure the level of flexibility from pure solution of supplier selection problem by quantitative and qualitative model. The methodology of FSS problem is presented and demonstrated through an illustrative example of multi-product, multi-source and multi-period case. © 2014 Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.},

The objective is to minimize total cost. The network must be dynamically reconfigured (i.e., by opening facilities, expanding and/or contracting their capacities, and closing facilities) over time to accommodate changing trends in demand and/or costs. The problem involves a multi-period, multi-product, multi-echelon supply chain. Research objectives of this paper are a traditional formulation and a network-based model of the DSCR problem; tests to promote intuitive interpretation of our models; tests to identify computational characteristics of each model to determine if one offers superior solvability; and tests to identify sensitivity of run time relative to primary parameters. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {Purpose - The conceptualization of flexibility in organizations
historically emerged from three views which relate to economic, to
organizational and to manufacturing perspectives. Despite the growing
number of publications about supply chain flexibility in the area of
supply chain management, there is a lack of consensus on how to define
and to conceptualize supply chain flexibility from a management point of
view. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview
of the literature on the supply chain flexibility perspective and
contributes to our understanding of the current state of research and
its future development.
Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology used is the
systematic literature review. In total 92 articles were selected from
databases of well-known journal publishers in the field of economics,
business studies and management sciences as well as grey literature to
cover the topic of supply chain flexibility.
Findings - A limited number of studies in the field of supply chain
flexibility apply theories and define the term supply chain flexibility.
Instead they focus on a particular part or dimension of the supply
chain. Based on the analysis, a distinction is made between flexibility
in the supply chain and supply chain flexibility. Based on the function
and characteristics of the supply chain, the authors selected 30
flexibility dimensions that cover supply chain flexibility by
concentrating on the different business areas involved.
Research limitations/implications - The results support researchers and
practitioners by identifying relevant trends and gaps in the field of
supply chain flexibility.
Originality/value - The authors review the dimensions and aspects of
supply chain flexibility that are currently taken into account in the
literature. In this way, the authors provide an overarching perspective
on the flexibility literature relating to supply chains.},

framework in which dynamic capabilities (DCs) for the creation of
logistics flexibility are outlined, and elaborate it further based on
empirical data from a case study at a Swedish fast fashion retailer.
Design/methodology/approach A conceptual framework that aims to
delineate the relationship between generic classes of DCs and logistics
flexibility is proposed. Thereafter, based on a theory elaboration
approach, empirical data from a case study at a Swedish fast fashion
retailer is used to identify more specific DCs and further outline the
characteristics of the DCs classes. Findings The proposed framework
draws on the three DC classes of sensing, seizing and reconfiguring, and
how they underscore logistics range and logistics response flexibility.
The framework also distinguishes between DC classes and logistics
flexibility that occur at operational, structural and strategic levels.
DCs for the creation of logistics flexibility at a Swedish fast fashion
retailer have also been identified and described as a means to further
elaborate the characteristics of the DC classes. Research
limitations/implications Current empirical data is limited to one
specific company context. Practical implications The research presents a
systematic and comprehensive map of different DCs that underscore
logistics flexibility, a useful tool supporting logistics development
efforts regarding flexibility. Originality/value The establishment of a
more detailed DC lens, in which different classes of DCs are included,
means that an improved understanding for how flexibility is created can
be achieved. It helps the research to move beyond the ``here and now″
existence of logistics flexibility to instead focus on how logistics
flexibility can be created.},

 abstract = {Factory in a box (FiB) is an emerging technology that meets the dynamic
and diverse market demand by carrying a factory module on vehicles to
perform on-site production near customers' locations. It is suitable for
meeting time-sensitive demands, such as the outbreak of disasters or
epidemics/pandemics. Compared to traditional manufacturing, FiB poses a
new challenge of frequently reconfiguring supply chain networks since
the final production location changes as the vehicle carrying the
factory travels. Supply chain network reconfiguration involves decisions
regarding whether suppliers or manufacturers can be retained in the
supply chain or replaced. Such a supply chain reconfiguration problem is
coupled with manufacturing process planning, which assigns tasks to each
manufacturer that impacts material flow in the supply chain network.
Considering the supply chain reconfigurability, this article develops a
new mathematical model based on nonlinear integer programming to
optimize supply chain reconfiguration and assembly planning jointly. An
evolutionary algorithm (EA) is developed and customized to the joint
optimization of process planning and supplier/manufacturer selection.
The performance of EA is verified with a nonlinear solver for a relaxed
version of the problem. A case study on producing a medical product
demonstrates the methodology in guiding supply chain reconfiguration and
process planning as the final production site relocates in response to
local demands. The methodology can be potentially generalized to supply
chain and service process planning for a mobile hospital offering
on-site medical services.},

 abstract = {The reliability of supply partners is particularly vital in agile supply chains as it is vulnerable to the inability of a supply partner to meet its high responsiveness and flexibility requirements resulting in the disruption of the whole network. Disruption can have expensive and extensive results for the entire agile supply chain. To mitigate the risk of disruption and improve the reliability of the whole agile supply chain, decision-makers need to pay more attention to supply chain design and construction while simultaneously taking into account the sourcing strategy decisions. This paper proposes a series of models for the design of agile supply chains using dynamic programming modeling. These provide decision-makers with a systematic way of analyzing one of the key decisions of sourcing strategy, namely the trade-off between the number of supply partners and reliability. The efficacy of the models is demonstrated through their application to a Chinese bus and coach manufacturer by way of an empirical illustration. The results show that this approach is effective for this application, and it can be applied in other related decision-making scenarios. The methods offered in this paper provide managers with a practical tool to design their agile supply chains while considering the trade-offs between the number of partners and the reliability of the entire agile supply chain. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {A new e-Service model called dynamic supply chain is characterized by their dynamic nature in easily being formed and disbanded with the seamless connectivity provided by e-Marketplace. The new term "supply mesh" was coined to represent this virtual community of companies in which dynamic supply chains, as per project (also known as make-to-order), are formed across different tiers of suppliers. In a supply mesh, a dynamic supply chain can be formed vertically, from the top to the bottom layers, mediating different companies for a project. Companies that are on the same level laterally are usually competitors, and the companies that are linked vertically as supply chains are trading partners. From a global view, the companies that are connected in the supply mesh can be viewed as individual entities that have self-interest. They may compete for survival as well as collaborate with each other for jobs. Given such complex relations the challenge is to find an optimal group of members for a dynamic supply chain in the supply mesh. A multi-agent model called the collaborative single machine earliness/tardiness (CSET) model was recently proposed for the optimal formation of make-to-order supply chains. This paper investigates the possibilities of applying CSET in a supply mesh, and the corresponding allocation schemes are experimentally studied in simulations. One scheme called Cost-driven principle leads to destructive competition while the other one namely Pareto-optimal evolves into a cooperative competition that tries to mutually benefit every participant. The results, based on samples from the U.S. textile industry, show that a cooperative competition scheme is superior in terms of optimal allocation, which obtains maximum satisfaction for all participants. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

While this proposition seems coherent in theory, empirical evidence supporting this is limited, as existing literature has centred on exploring the impact of supply chain resilience on disruptions which are based on set time frames, non-supply chain specific as well as examining non-dynamic disruptive events. This study contends that resilience strategies are dynamic and as such their applications within supply chains differ. Therefore examining the impact of resilience will be appropriate on a dynamic disruption within a specific supply chain. In view of this, the paper examines through existing literature the applicability of agility within the pharmaceutical supply chain when dynamic disruptions like drug shortages occur.

Recognizing that greater cross-functional and cross-company efforts to increase flexibility were making a focus limited to manufacturing flexibility insufficient to deal with a more complex and turbulent environment, a growing body of literature began to look beyond the flexible factory to the flexible supply chain. Although researchers reach an agreement with a depiction of flexibility as a capability of responding to uncertainty at minimal cost, the effect of environmental uncertainty on flexibility is not consistent in different empirical studies, representing at least three perspectives: a positive effect, a negative effect, and no effect.

 abstract = {Through the development and usage of an agent-based model, this article investigates firms' adaptive strategies against disruptions in a supply chain network. Viewing supply chain networks as complex adaptive systems, we first construct and analyze a realworld supply chain network among 2,971 firms spanning 90 industry sectors. We then develop an agent-based simulation to show how the model of firms' adaptive behaviors can leverage competition relationships within a supply chain network. The simulation also models how disruptions propagate in the supply chain network through cascading failures. With the simulation, we seek to understand if a firm's adaptive behaviors can reduce the impact of disruptions in supply chain networks. Therefore, we propose, evaluate, and analyze two types of adaptive strategies a firm can leverage to reduce the negative effects of supply chain network disruptions. First, we deploy in our model a reactive strategy, which restructures the network in response to a disruption event among first-tier suppliers. Next, we develop and propose proactive strategies, which are used when a distant disruption is observed but has not yet hit the focal firm. We discuss the implications related to how and when firms can improve their resilience against supply disruptions by leveraging adaptive strategies. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.},

 abstract = {Shipbuilding materials are characterized by diverse kinds, large quantities and wide distribution of suppliers, which make the supply network complicated. Complex networks have led to increasing uncertainties that may cause disruptions in the supply chain. Flexibility is an effective measure to cope with uncertainty, thus this paper aims to integrate flexibility into the supply chain of shipbuilding materials and explore supply, logistics, organization and quality flexibility by focusing on the requirements of shipbuilding enterprises. This paper combines Quality Function Deployment (QFD), fuzzy theory and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to guide practical design. After determining five customer requirements (CRs) and 24 design requirements (DRs), QFD links CRs and DRs to determine the most important feasible DRs for improvement of supply chain flexibility. Research results reveal that the most important design requirements can be summarized into four aspects, namely domestic procurement, supply chain member cooperation, supplier supervision, and emergency response construction. Moreover, it is found that long‐term strategic partnerships with suppliers and strategic logistics outsourcing are effective strategies. This paper provides insight into implications for strategic decisions of shipbuilding enterprises. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

 abstract = {The COVID 19 pandemic, fluctuating demand, market uncertainty and the emergence of new technologies explain the need for a more flexible and agile supply chain. In fact, several important factors should be taken into account in the process of building an adaptive and reconfigurable supply chain. Reconfigurability is used to measure quantitatively the capability of supply chain to change easily their structure and functions. The aim of this work is to evaluate the level of reconfigurability of a supply chain. Quantitative measures of six indicators that characterize reconfigurability are presented in this paper. Then, an index of reconfigurability in supply chain is developed based on The Multi-Attribute Utility Theory in order to choose the most reconfigurable configuration. An illustrative example is also given. From the discussion, it is deduced that the characteristics of the reconfigurable supply chain impacts positively on the degree of reconfigurability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

They must also implement strategies that allows them to deal with these new challenges. Supply chain modularity offers the opportunity to change and reorganize the structure of the supply chain to meet changing market needs. In this paper, we propose a new framework to design a modular supply chain using Design Structure Matrix and a modularity measurement in Reconfigurable Supply Chain. We also show the importance of integrating the direction of flows, i.e. inbound and outbound flows in the calculation of modularity and, in particular, its impact on lead time.

 abstract = {In an increasingly changing and uncertain market, adapting the supply chain to new changes requires reconfiguring supply chains processes to improve its performance. The decision-making process for the reconfiguration of supply chains must take into consideration the uncertainty and imprecision related to the judgments of the decision-makers. This paper deals with uncertainty in the decision-making process of supply chain reconfiguration using the Dempster-Shafer theory. An approach to reconfigure supply chain business processes under uncertainty is also proposed to improve the decision-making process for supply chain reconfiguration. The reconfiguration of the supply chain involves selecting the most appropriate configuration, process, actor and role that should be reconfigured in advance in order to optimise the reconfiguration using the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. To reduce the imprecision and uncertainty related to the judgments and preferences of the decision-makers, the Dempster-Shafer theory is applied and, to validate the introduced approach, a case study is conducted. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

 abstract = {The reconfiguration of supply chain is becoming a crucial concept used to deal with market disruptions and changes such as the COVID-19 pandemic, demand uncertainty, and new technologies. It can be defined as the ability of the supply chain to change its structure and functions in order to adapt to new changes. Its assessment requires an understanding of its quantitative factors to provide indicators that are easy to interpret. Effective reconfigurability assessment can be achieved by measuring quantitatively its six characteristics (modularity, integrability, convertibility, diagnosability, scalability, and customization). This paper aims at identifying the quantitative factors of each characteristic and their inter-relationships by using Total Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM). The structural model obtained by TISM is applied to understand the dependency quantitative factors. Based on TISM results, a classification of quantitative factors is determined using “Matrice d′Impacts Croisés, Multiplication Appliquée à un Classement” (MICMAC) analysis. This article provides a better understanding of the six characteristics previously mentioned to improve the reconfigurability of supply chains by considering the interactions between their factors. Thus, this analysis helps managers to understand the characteristics that influence the change of the supply chain structure and those that enable changing the supply chain functions in order to optimize the supply chain reconfiguration process. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {This contribution presents the application of a systematic tool for the synthesis of flexible supply networks under uncertain conditions. The proposed methodology consists of four steps during which an inflexible supply network constructed under nominal conditions progressively develops into a flexible network. First-stage variables are determined by a two-scenario mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model in which uncertain parameters deviate through specified ranges from their nominal values. The second-stage variables are determined by one-scenario Monte Carlo stochastic optimization. The approach is demonstrated on an illustrative case study of an agricultural biogas supply network with the objective being to maximize economic, eco- and viability profits. Flexible biogas supply networks with 28 uncertain parameters were achieved with acceptable computational effort. The expected economic and viability profits decreased compared to nominal profits by around 8%, while the eco-profit increased slightly as a result of higher utilization of less burdensome raw materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Supplier selection is nowadays one of the critical topics in supply chain management. This paper presents a new decision making approach for group multi-criteria supplier selection problem, which clubs supplier selection process with order allocation for dynamic supply chains to cope market variations. More specifically, the developed approach imitates the knowledge acquisition and manipulation in a manner similar to the decision makers who have gathered considerable knowledge and expertise in procurement domain. Nevertheless, under many conditions, exact data are inadequate to model real-life situation and fuzzy logic can be incorporated to handle the vagueness of the decision makers. As per this concept, fuzzy-AHP method is used first for supplier selection through four classes (CLASS I: Performance strategy, CLASS II: Quality of service, CLASS III: Innovation and CLASS IV: Risk), which are qualitatively meaningful. Thereafter, using simulation based fuzzy TOPSIS technique, the criteria application is quantitatively evaluated for order allocation among the selected suppliers. As a result, the approach generates decision-making knowledge, and thereafter, the developed combination of rules order allocation can easily be interpreted, adopted and at the same time if necessary, modified by decision makers. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, an illustrative example is presented and the results analyzed. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
