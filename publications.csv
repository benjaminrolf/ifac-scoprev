The emergence and increasing pressure to invest in new IS architecture and infrastructures has become a high priority issue within organisations, and largely influenced by the need to deliver better value products and service through robust and responsive supply chains. With this in mind, business managers are seeking to use appropriate methods and techniques to appraise and justify the financial contribution of IS at strategic, operational and tactical levels. Thus, comprehensive but understandable methodologies are needed to solve the complicated project justification problems arising from the complexity of new technologies. Notwithstanding, a wide body of literature has emerged that sheds light on various methods for evaluating the cost and benefits of IT/IS investment, ranging from simple to very complex techniques. This paper sets out to provide a review of this literature in order to lend insights into our understanding of the plethora of reported research in the literature that has propagated investment justification and benefits management models and frameworks. We show that the IT/IS evaluation literature contributes significantly to scholarship on the IS.

Based on theoretical foundations of the upper echelon theory and the dynamic capability theory, it also assesses the mediating role played by supply chain innovation in the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and supply chain adaptability. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed on survey data collected from 139 firms in Sudan, Japan, and China. The results reveal that entrepreneurial leadership had positive effects on supply chain innovation and supply chain adaptability despite varying business environments. The results also provided interesting findings regarding the moderating role of supply chain innovation as a mediator of the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and supply chain adaptability. The findings of the study stress the importance of entrepreneurial leadership for firms’ adaptability across nations. Although the number of countries included in this study was limited, these countries exhibit different cultural and structural settings. These findings suggest the possibility of the generalizability of the results. The findings also imply that firms should place greater emphasis on improving their supply chain processes and upgrading relevant technologies in order to facilitate the development of adaptable supply chains. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126215018&doi=10.1007%2fs43069-022-00135-x&partnerID=40&md5=cad6683460152a0459d671efd071ac62,Scopus

Using low integrated, standard contractual relationships as a reference group, this study assesses how moderately integrated partnerships and highly integrated strategic relationships moderate the impact of LSP's innovation on the user's SC adaptability. Methodology: Moderated partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed on survey data collected from 48 Sudanese companies. Findings: The findings revealed that innovation by LSPs had the greatest positive impact on SC adaptability in firms maintaining a moderate level of logistics integration. Interestingly, firms highly integrated with their LSPs witnessed a reduced effect of logistics innovation on their SC adaptability. In other words, while user-provider partnerships reinforced the impact of LSPs' innovation on user's SC adaptability, strategic relationships weakened this impact. Originality: Extant literature advocates fully integrating with LSPs to build a responsive, efficient SC. Nevertheless, the complexities of managing a highly integrated relationship with LSPs may pose challenges that exceed the expected benefits of such relationships. This study provides empirical evidence that moderate, rather than full, integration with LSPs may yield greater benefits for the users of logistics services. © 2021 Proceedings of the Hamburg International Conference of Logistics.

The response time to customer orders, critical to the success of the supply chain, is the sum of the flow time in the facility and the delivery time to the customers. The response time performance in our models is measured by the probability that the response time is shorter than a constant. This nonlinear performance measure makes the models less or not tractable. The objective of both problems is to minimize the expected network cost that consists of the cost of delivery to customers as a function of the time of delivery (or the mode of transportation), the fixed cost of locating facilities and the capacity cost as a linear function of the processing capacity. The main decision variables are the number and locations of facilities, the resources allocated to them and the delivery mode selected between facilities and demand. In the first problem, a constraint is imposed to ensure an acceptable response time level. In the second problem, a penalty is charged on the number of days that each unit is delivered later than the targeted response time and is incorporated into the objective function. In the first problem, the probabilistic constraint on the flow time can be linearized and the problem can be formulated as an integer linear programming model. In the second problem, we propose an approximation approach to linearize the objective function and an iterative search and cut algorithm to combine linear approximation with neighborhood search. A multi-start meta-heuristic is also suggested. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of these solution procedures. Recommendations are made on the basis of the computational results. This appears to be the first study in the area of locating capacitated facilities with stochastic demand to incorporate the delivery mode choice decision and to evaluate the expected congestion cost as a function of the actual flow time in the facilities, instead of the average one. The models developed enable the decision maker to investigate the effect of a combination of facility location, capacity allocation, and delivery mode decisions on the expected network cost and the response time. In addition, the findings of the computational experiments shed light on tuning parameters of approximation algorithms. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091814777&doi=10.1002%2fnav.21940&partnerID=40&md5=6e1d1bc4c29a502411bfb23f22a267bf,Scopus

As per Arent et al. (Improved offshore wind resource assessment in global climate stabilization scenarios, [4]), 77% of global offshore wind potential is located in water depths deeper than 60 m. However, floating substructures do not yet meet the market expectations with regard to LCOE. By integrating new materials as well as modularity into the design, the costs of the tension leg platform (TLP) development presented in this pater have been significantly reduced. Pre-stressed Ultra-High-Performance-Concrete (UHPC) pipes will be used for this sub-structure. The buoyancy bodies will be fabricated using concrete shell elements known from tunnel engineering. The use of casted iron for the nodes and the Transition Piece (TP) leads to further advantages regarding design and costs. All components are designed for transportability (e.g. via railway) in order to ensure a high level of flexibility within the supply chain. The structural design has been calculated to support turbines of up to 6 MW rated power and more. In October 2017, a scaled model (1:50) of the new substructure design for use with a 6 MW turbine was successfully exposed to wind and wave loads at the Ocean Engineering Tank of the École Centrale de Nantes (ECN). In June 2018, a second measurement campaign was started, and in September 2018 a third campaign will be run to verify the transport & installation process. Th presentation and paper will focus on the TLP design as well as on the model fabrication and scaling. Furthermore, measurement results from the ECN test will be presented. Therefore, the presentation will introduce the measurement setup as well as the measurement types to verify the simulation model.

Design/methodology/approach: Theoretical synthesis and conceptualization of new construct. Findings: Based on Madhavaram and Hunt’s (2008) resource hierarchy concept, the key to successfully competing with a sustainable supply chain may lie in whether the resources enabling both sustainability and effective supply chains are interdependent, as opposed to merely co-existent. Research limitations/implications: Most current theory regarding sustainable supply chains regards environmentally-friendly factors as resources that are additively bundled with supply chain resources. To determine if competitive performance differentials exist between truly green supply chains, and supply chains that merely adopt green practices, measurement must account for both the interdependence of green and supply chain resources, and their common cultural antecedents. Practical implications: The study indicates that it is not sufficient for firms to have expertise in both sustainability and in supply chain practices; managers in each of those areas must develop the cultural antecedents of both supply chain and sustainability excellence if firms are to achieve meaningful competitive capabilities through sustainable supply chains.

The adaptive cycle framework may help explain change and the long term dynamics and resilience in supply chain networks. Adaptive cycles assume that dynamic systems such as supply chain networks go through stages of growth, development, collapse and reorientation. Adaptive cycles suggest that the resilience of a complex adaptive system such as supply chains are not fixed but expand and contract over time and resilience requires such systems to navigate each of the cycles’ four stages successfully. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses the adaptive cycle framework to explain supply chain resilience (SCRES). It explores the phases of the adaptive cycle, its pathologies and key properties and links these to competences and behaviors that are important for system and SCRES. The study develops a conceptual framework linking adaptive cycles to SCRES. The goal is to extend dynamic theories of SCRES by borrowing from the adaptive cycle framework. We review the literature on the adaptive cycle framework, its properties and link these to SCRES. Findings: The key insight is that the adaptive cycle concept can broaden our understanding of SCRES beyond focal scales, including cross-scale resilience. As a framework, the adaptive cycle can explain the mechanisms that support or prevent resilience in supply chains. Adaptive cycles may also give us new insights into the sort of competences required to avoid stagnation, promote system renewal as resilience expands and contracts over time. Research limitations/implications: The adaptive cycle may move our discussion of resilience beyond engineering and ecological resilience to include evolutionary resilience. While the first two presently dominates our theorizing on SCRES, evolutionary resilience may be more insightful than both are. Adaptive cycles capture the idea of change, adaptation and transformation and allow us to explore cross-scale resilience. Practical implications: Knowing how to prepare for and overcoming key pathologies associated with each stage of the adaptive cycle can broaden our repertoire of strategies for managing SCRES across time. Human agency is important for preventing systems from crossing critical thresholds into imminent collapse. More importantly, disruptions may present an opportunity for innovation and renewal for building more resilience supply chains. Originality/value: This research is one of the few studies that have applied the adaptive cycle concept to SCRES and extends our understanding of the dynamic structure of SCRES. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087816005&doi=10.1108%2fIJLM-01-2020-0019&partnerID=40&md5=eb1d82e746c9791b221a32bc21acd7f3,Scopus

Scholars are also requested to conduct further studies such as investigating the effect of supply chain redundancy on supply chain performance. © 2022 Growing Science Ltd.

These unexpected risks and natural inevitable changes force supply chain management to adopt new and innovative approaches in order to deal better with risk-related disruptions.The resilient supply chain is one of these approaches. The goal of this study is to use the grounded theory method to investigate the concept of resilience and identify each of the resilience factors in supply chain studies. Adaptability, reversibility/recovery, versatility, reactivity, response to disruption, and the ability to continue working in difficult situations were identified as six main concepts for improving supply chain resilience as a result of analyses.

It has grown from being a promising idea to one of the fastest research and development paradigms of the computing industry. However, security and privacy concerns represent a significant hindrance to the widespread adoption of cloud computing services. Likewise, the attributes of the cloud such as multi-tenancy, dynamic supply chain, limited visibility of security controls and system complexity, have exacerbated the challenge of assessing cloud risks. In this paper, we conduct a real-world case study to validate the use of a supply chaininclusive risk assessment model in assessing the risks of a multicloud SaaS application. Using the components of the Cloud Supply Chain Cyber Risk Assessment (CSCCRA) model, we show how the model enables cloud service providers (CSPs) to identify critical suppliers, map their supply chain, identify weak security spots within the chain, and analyse the risk of the SaaS application, while also presenting the value of the risk in monetary terms. A key novelty of the CSCCRA model is that it caters for the complexities involved in the delivery of SaaS applications and adapts to the dynamic nature of the cloud, enabling CSPs to conduct risk assessments at a higher frequency, in response to a change in the supply chain. © 2019 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074131341&doi=10.1109%2fCSCloud%2fEdgeCom.2019.00-14&partnerID=40&md5=b6ddec7c8268d3557ce38c68501e82b1,Scopus

The decision variables in the model are monthly harvest levels of two types of woody biomass, forest harvest residues and unutilized biomass, from 19,315 forest depletion cells (each 1 km2) for a one year planning horizon. Sixteen scenarios are tested to examine the sensitivity of the cost minimization model to changing economic and technological parameters. Reduction in moisture content and improvement of conversion efficiency showed relatively higher reductions in monthly and total costs of woody biomass feedstock for the AGS.

This leverages Organizational learning, organizational culture and corporate knowledge in implementing changes. The ""IPST"" is the moderator between the supply chain business process reengineering of the process changes and systems thinking approach for improvement. Design/Methodology/approach: A theoretical framework is developed from the systems thinking literature; linking integrated system thinking to firm supply chain sustainability. Theoretical versus practical integrated thinking approaches are applied to contrast the rigid management of sustainability with a model that focuses on relationships and broader indicators of societal supply chain business dynamic issues. Illustrations of the conceptualized framework are presented for discussion and for further empirical research. Findings: The (IPST) the Iceberg Problem Solving Tools is a practical tool for the current repetitive events in complex business environments of the supply chain. The tool helps the business management, in seeing the entire effects of the pining emerging events within the firm's supply chain business process; where small changes in the leverage points of the chain business processes or system process lead to tremendous results in the performance of the firm's supply chain. Practical implication: Potential firms supply chain crises can arise if the daily business events are not well analysed this will impact the root causes; by taking the right actions for the right causes of the business events to avoid management quick win failures. The implemented action taken will occur by placing the triggers of the supply chain events in its original form; within the main workflow process; this will have the effect of implementing the best results of the ""IPST"" in any supply chain business scenarios.

Case overview/synopsis: The case deals with a typical challenge of periodical delivery systems, in this case specifically of The Topical, an Indian periodical. The service manager of the company, Sara Jindal, recognized a problem with customer retention. She explored the causes and found that The Topical, a 20-year-old company, was losing its popularity due to the untimely delivery of the magazines. To solve the problem Jindal, tried to gain an understanding of the operational processes and realized that there was no issue in the warehouse regarding inventory control, management or order pickup. However, she found that the magazines were parceled through book post and that there was no tracking policy in the company for the deliveries. Therefore, it was not possible to know whether the magazines got delivered on time. The matter was taken seriously and as a solution, the possibility of integrating drones into the delivery system came up.

The mathematical model's objective is to maximize the net present value (NPV) under uncertain parameters of potential demand and transportation costs. Therefore, the sensitivity of the actual demand on the pricing decisions of the final and returned products in the supply chain network. The main decisions of the mathematical model are to maximize the NPV related to the location of potential facilities, determine the amount of product inventory in the production center, reduce the length of the queue of production lines and determine the optimal amount of product transfer flow between facilities. Also, the most important decisions related to the related network are determining the optimal price of final products and returns in the supply chain network. Flexible Robust-Fuzzy optimization (FRFO) method is used to control the uncertainty parameters and the four algorithms G-HHO, PSO, ALO and GWO are used to solve the problem. The calculation results show that with the increase of uncertainty in the network, the value of NPV decreases and also with the increase of the number of production lines, due to the reduction of the queue length of the parts, the cost of waiting time decreases and the value of NPV increases. On the price of final and return products, the price in the forward and backward chain has increased and as a result, the NPV value has increased. By analyzing more tests, it was also observed that the G-HHO algorithm obtained the highest average NPV value in solving large numerical examples. While the PSO algorithm has reached the near-optimal solution in the shortest time. Also, there has been no significant difference between the averages of the comparison indices between the solution algorithms. Examination of the solution results between the solution methods shows that the maximum relative difference between the results is less than 5%, and the proposed G-HHO algorithm has the highest efficiency in solving large sample problems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137275051&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2022.118741&partnerID=40&md5=8c5ee13a986e7b62493afacf11710710,Scopus

In this paper, a model of evaluating SCN is detailed first. Then, the methodology for the Reliability-based robust design optimization approach is provided. A case study is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Reliability measure and the developed Reliability-based robust design optimization model. Results from the case study have shown that by implementing the developed optimization approach, a SCN is able to achieve a 90% of required reliability while minimizing uncertainty impact. © IEOM Society International. © IEOM Society International.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018421252&partnerID=40&md5=eb033d39698207c291dd32fbde68d234,Scopus

To cope with these challenges, mathematical programming models are developed to evaluate supply chain flexibility. However, under uncertainty, supply chain models become complex and the scope of flexibility analysis is generally reduced. This paper presents a unified approach that can evaluate the flexibility of a four-echelon supply chain via a robust stochastic programming model. The model simultaneously considers the plans of multiple business divisions such as marketing, logistics, manufacturing, and procurement, whose goals are often conflicting. A numerical example with deterministic parameters is presented to introduce the analysis, and then, the model stochastic parameters are considered to evaluate flexibility. The results of the analysis on supply, manufacturing, and distribution flexibility are presented. Tradeoff analysis of demand variability and service levels is also carried out. The proposed approach facilitates the adoption of different management styles, thus improving supply chain resilience. The model can be extended to contexts pertaining to supply chain disruptions; for example, the model can be used to explore operation strategies when subtle events disrupt supply, manufacturing, or distribution. © 2018 Almeida et al.

This supply chain design requires the development of flexibility as a critical capability. To this end, firms are considering Additive Manufacturing (AM) as one strategic option that could enable such a capability. This paper develops a conceptual model that maps AM characteristics relevant to flexibility against key market disruption scenarios. Following the development of this model, a case study is undertaken to indicate the impact of adopting AM on supply chain flexibility from four major flexibility-related aspects: volume, mix, delivery, and new product introduction. An inter-process comparison is implemented in this case study using data collected from a manufacturing company that produces pipe fittings using Injection Moulding (IM). The supply chain employing IM in this case study shows greater volume and delivery flexibility levels (i.e., 65.68% and 92.8% for IM compared to 58.70% and 75.35% for AM, respectively) while the AM supply chain shows greater mix and new product introduction flexibility, indicated by the lower changeover time and cost of new product introduction to the system (i.e., 0.33 h and €0 for AM compared to 4.91 h and €30,000 for IM, respectively). This work will allow decision-makers to take timely decisions by providing useful information on the effect of AM adoption on supply chain flexibility in different sudden disruption scenarios such as demand uncertainty, demand variability, lead-time compression and product variety. © 2021 by the authors.

Companies these days are continuously looking to expand their market geographically to attract new customers. With that in mind, the main concern of companies is to achieve their customers' requirements, which makes the supply chain (SC) longer and more complex. This leads to increased difficulty in managing the SC along with controlling risks and disruptions in SC. Such as loss of a critical supplier, a fire accident in the production facility, or an act of terrorism. To deal with these risks, SC must be designed to provide an efficient and effective response, keep its process working and be capable of recovering to their original state after disruptive events, this is considered as the core of supply chain resilience (SCRes). Furthermore, companies that design their SC with capabilities to react quickly to any disruptions in its process have the opportunity to become more stabilized and acquire an improved position in the market. Researchers have been exploring ways to acquire supply chain resilience, such as encouraging and improving collaboration between SC partners or by increasing the organization's visibility through monitoring SC events and patterns. Studies have shown that IT has a role in improving SCRes, such as information-sharing systems to promote collaboration and visibility tactics. However, recent research trends are exploring new and emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT). Despite the growing interest in IoT, minimal research has been carried out for its application in SCRes. Research in this direction is necessary to explore opportunities provided by IoT to redesign SC which in turn reinforces flexibility of supply chains and aspects of analysis of the product quality and how it could enable companies to improve their SCRes. This study is directly focused to identify and highlight this gap. © 2017 The Authors.

However, short delivery lead times imply stochastic demand peaks, for which production economics literature indicates that flexible capacity can be applied to mitigate their negative effects. In this paper a two stage supply chain with flexible capacity at the supplier and lead time dependent demand at the customer is investigated. Specifically, the random customer demand depends on the delivery lead time provided by the supplier and demand which cannot be fulfilled is lost. An analytical model is developed which includes predefined steady capacity and a demand dependent decision for flexible capacity. The trade-off between lost sales due to the provided delivery lead time, lost sales due to a lack of capacity, inventory cost and the cost for flexible capacity is discussed. Numerical results indicate that high capacity flexibility is needed if lost sales cost, demand variance, or customer lead time sensitivity is high. Furthermore, the positive effect of information sharing within the supply chain is evaluated. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020039320&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2017.05.007&partnerID=40&md5=14a88d44d127e077d3e8e90c463d9ed6,Scopus

The contract stipulates when a buyback contract is executed and the amount of buyback. We model the interaction of supply chain participants as a Stackelberg game and incorporate the participants’ reservation profits into the game to examine the effectiveness of the ABB contract with complete information. We demonstrate that the ABB contract can conveniently coordinate the supply chain, flexibly allocate profit, and facilitate avoidance of the aggressive overordering behavior of the retailer. This model is extended to the situation of information asymmetry, where the retailer holds private information about the cost of sales in discrete or continuous states. The optimal strategies of the supply chain and the participants are derived. Information asymmetry can damage the supplier but be beneficial to the retailer. The condition under which the supply chain achieves coordination is clarified. A numerical simulation is performed to verify and extend the results of the theoretical analysis. We show that the ABB contract always outperforms the ordinary wholesale price and buyback contracts with complete information. Supply chain coordination is more likely to be achieved if the demand variability is lower when weighing whether to share private information.

The contribution of this research is to explore and evaluate sustainable agility in supply chains for a dairy manufacturing organization located in Saudi Arabia. Other contributions of this research are to update the literature about the different factors contributing to achieve agile supply chain, propose conceptual framework and assessment approach incorporating the relationships between sustainable supply-chain capabilities, enablers, and attributes, and shortlisting the agility barriers and how they would facilitate manufacturing organizations’ performance. The paper presents supply chain agility evaluation approach, which covers identification of agile supply-chain capabilities and drivers. It also presents a conceptual model and a framework to define agility level and barriers within the supply-chain. In the paper, fuzzy logic approach is preferred, owing to its capability to incorporate and deal with problems involving impreciseness and vagueness phenomena. Threshold-value in this study for the case organization is set to 0.24829. The outcome of the adopted approach indicates that 21 attributes performed below the threshold value; these attributes are further categorized as agility barriers. These are the barriers within their supply chain that impact the agility-level. For the case organization, the foremost priority is to enhance maintainability and serviceability to make it flexible and inexpensive to establish an agile responsive supply chain. At the same time, it should have priority to focus on development and integration of their core competencies to deal with cross-functional and cross-enterprise issues in supply chain. For the case organization, the agility level was found “very agile,” although it is below the “extremely agile.” Thus, a study was developed to understand the behaviour of the supply chain agility and assess/evaluate it to support decision makers in order to develop a strategic solution for different organizational barriers. © 2021 by the authors.

This requires the supply chains to be highly flexible, visible, reliable and cost-effective leading to the achievement of Agile Supply Chain (ASC). In today’s competitive market, achieving agility in supply chain needs dynamic leadership, strategic vision, mutual cooperation from all members and effective utilization of information technology through customer focus. In spite of their initiatives to achieve ASC for improving their organizational performance, barring a few large companies, the medium and small size manufacturing companies have not yet been able to adopt and design supply chains which lead to ASC. This may be due to various challenges in the process of achieving agility. Also, the published literature in this area is very scanty.

Design/methodology/approach: Data on the consumption of cement and site works for 100 ongoing building construction sites were gathered for a period of 12 months. The variance partitioning capabilities of the Ordinary Least Squares and Hierarchical Linear Modelling forms of regression analysis are comparatively used to evaluate the sensitivity of cement demand to the meteorological profile of wet-humid climate Findings: The study outcome provides statistical evidence demonstrating that the meteorological profile of wet-humid climate induces a significantly high percentage of the variance in the real-time demand for bagged cement on construction sites. However, nested within this variance, are the fixed effects of the cement footprint of the building architecture inherent in the locality. Particularly, positive changes to reduce the wet trade composition of buildings or compensating changes in technological bias, are necessary to combat weather interference in the humid tropics.

Issues with U.S. and global markets for helium include inelastic demand, economic availability of helium only as a byproduct, only 4–5 major producers, helium’s propensity to escape earth’s crust, an ongoing absence of storage facilities comparable to the FHR, and a lack of consequences for the venting of helium. The complex combination of these economic, physical, and regulatory issues is unique to helium, and determining helium’s practical availability goes far beyond estimating the technically accessible volume of underground resources. Although most of these issues have been analyzed since helium was recognized to be a valuable mineral commodity in the early 1900s, very few economic models have been developed that adequately consider the unique characteristics of helium and helium markets. In particular, there is a notable lack of recent empirical work to estimate the responsiveness of helium demand, supply, prices, and trade patterns to the ongoing drawdown and sale of helium reserves stored in the FHR. In general, existing models of helium either do not account for an oligopoly controlling supply, or they do not evaluate potential helium extraction and storage programs based on an intertemporal maximization of the value of the resource.

Methods: We used a human-centered design (HCD) approach to engage communities and community health volunteers (CHVs) in redesigning a proven data-centric supply chain approach that included a digital solution, called cStock, for this challenging context. We conducted the HCD process in 4 phases: (1) understanding intent, (2) research and insights, (3) ideation and prototyping, and (4) supply chain design and requirements building. Data collection used qualitative methods and involved a range of stakeholders including CHVs, supervisors, and local beneficiaries. CHVs and their supervisors also participated in cStock usability testing. Drawing on insights and personas generated from the research, stakeholders ideated and codesigned supply chain tools. Results: The research identified critical insights for informing the redesign of cStock for nomadic communities. These insights were categorized into supply chain, information systems, human resources, behaviors, service delivery infrastructure, and connectivity. Four supply chain data solutions were designed, prototyped, tested, and iterated: A stock recording paper-based form, a user-friendly cStock application, a supervisor cStock application, and an unstructured supplementary service data reporting system using feature phones. Conclusions: Using the HCD process incorporated the perspective of CHVs and their communities and provided key insights to inform the design of the supply chain and adapt cStock. The process helped make cStock to be inclusive and have the potential to have a meaningful impact on strengthening the supply chain for seminomadic and nomadic communities in northern Kenya. A strong supply chain for these CHVs will increase access to essential and reproductive health commodities and contribute to improving the overall health and well-being of these communities, especially women and children. © 2021 Johns Hopkins University Press.

Four case studies are compared in terms of uncertainty typology and strategies being adopted to improve supply chain flexibility. We present three propositions as a result of the study. First, to achieve better flexibility, companies have been focusing more on buffering than on proactive or redesign strategies.

Major issues such as supply disruptions, shortages of raw materials and spare parts, restricted transport, and ineffective exchange of information between actors within the supply chain have resulted. The empirical evidence of these events is widely discussed in the literature, which has brought out the urgent need to rethink the configuration of customer-supplier relations at an overall level. One technology that is much discussed in the literature and potentially useful in supporting supply chain processes is the blockchain technology. Blockchain has been gaining attraction across different sectors, even if there are still few applications in supply chain management, most at an experimental level. The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential applications of blockchain to support supply chain processes, to fill the gaps highlighted during the Covid pandemic. Through the analysis of the literature, the authors aim to give a preliminary overview on the relationships between Covid-19 impacts and benefits achievable by the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain, for an effective supply chain reconfiguration in a post-covid era.

The sustainability indicators of RP utilization were identified through a critical literature review and consulting two experienced RP practitioners to determine the key variables regarding the potential impact of RP on the supply chain components, with an emphasis on sustainability pillars. A generic system dynamics modeling was provided to simulate the RP-adapted supply chain and measure its sustainability performance. The simulation results indicated that RP utilization in the design phase could decrease the number of the assembly parts and material consumption in conventional manufacturing, while indirectly affecting the reduction of waste generation, logistics, CO2 emissions, processes, and the total costs which are related to environmental and economic aspects of the sustainable supply chain. Findings indicated that significant increase in operational skills and knowledge as the main indicators of the social dimension could remarkably reduce the failure rates and increase the quality of the products. This indicator plays a pivotal role in operational success and could be enhanced through training programs. Social sustainability indirectly affects environmental and economic sustainability. This was the first model-based research to examine the potential effects of RP on the sustainability of a conventional manufacturing.

The study is designed to examine conflicting views on the effect of increased levels of governance on organizations' flexibility and supply chain performance, and determine whether ERM capability influences the observed differential effects. Building on theories related to the electronic integration perspective of firm agility and the role of knowledge integration on the activation of the link between strategic flexibility and performance, we develop a theory of ERM as an enabler of IT integration, flexibility, and performance. A cross-sectional field study of six companies illustrates the interrelationships and provides preliminary support for the theory. Subsequent testing using data from 155 Chief Audit Executives provides strong support for the theory. The results show that a broad-based, strategic approach to ERM enhances flexibility and strengthens the relationship between flexibility and performance. The results also provide evidence that enhanced IT integration is the mechanism through which ERM strengthens both flexibility and in turn performance. © 2015.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84948425405&doi=10.1016%2fj.accinf.2015.10.001&partnerID=40&md5=664539ff761d5c2ecf89b55f92586b5f,Scopus

However, the question why and under what circumstances certain product variants cause performance problems within value chain operations remains unsolved. Existing process descriptions, data-models and IT-systems are remarkably supporting planning and optimization efforts, but show significant deficits regarding the integration of heterogeneous internal and cross-company systems. Relevant issues such as the evaluation of demand variety impacts on the subsequent value-adding steps in the value chain are not sufficiently solved. Ontological modelling could notably advance the information exchange in complex value chains and thus enhance value chain flexibility through a semantic harmonization that enables faster and faultless information flows between companies. Further advantages are the distinct reusability, modifiability, extendibility and shareability of ontology-based value chain models and software. Despite a distinct need to advance cross-company integration, ontologies are used in supply chain management only occasionally. The need for methodical enhancement is high. Thus, the objective of this paper is to investigate obtainable benefits of ontological modelling for supply chain management (SCM) – here substantiated by means of a methodological support to improve product variety management in value networks. We provide a literature review, a conceptual framework and an implementation-guide for use in scenarios that represent the problems mentioned.

For this purpose, a multi-objective mathematical model is suggested that minimizes the carbon emissions and the total costs and maximizes the responsiveness of the system. Due to the dynamic space of the business environment, uncertainty is an integral part of the supply chain problem. Therefore, this research applies the robust possibilistic programming method to cope with uncertainty. Afterwards, since the research problem has a high level of the complexity, a hybrid solution approach based on a heuristic method and the meta-goal programming method is developed to solve the research problem in a reasonable time. Then, due to the importance of the ventilator device during the recent pandemic (COVID-19), this study considers this product as a case study. The main contribution of the current study is to design a green-responsive closed-loop supply chain network under uncertainty using a multi-objective robust possibilistic programming model, for the first time in the literature, especially in the medical devices industry. On the other side, the other contribution of this study is to develop an efficient hybrid solution method. The achieved results demonstrate the efficiency of the offered model and the developed hybrid method. Eventually, by carrying out sensitivity analysis, the impact of some of the critical parameters on the model is investigated. Based on the obtained results, an increase in the demand sizes leads to increasing the environmental damages and the total costs while reducing the responsiveness level. On the other side, an increase in the rate of return leads to an increase in all of the objective functions. Also, the achieved results show that when the capacity parameter is increased, the total costs are decreased, but the responsiveness and environmental impacts are increased. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126263494&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-022-19105-1&partnerID=40&md5=eea53ab8d06ed8d4413d9d4685111827,Scopus

This paper presents an analytic approach based on Joint Economic Lot Sizing model, and aims at capturing the most significant impacts resulting from the implementation of the AM concept on a two-level supply chain. This assessment of AM from inventory and logistics standpoints is targeted at providing insights into how manufacturers could adapt their supply chains’ planning to accommodate new paradigms introduced by AM. A numerical example followed by sensitivity analysis of a real industrial case study is presented to provide evidence for the main findings and further generalise them. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057320676&doi=10.1080%2f23302674.2017.1340985&partnerID=40&md5=54b990c29da1783f0bf005979a67e445,Scopus

The authors test entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and supply chain learning orientation (SCLO) as two antecedents of DSCCs. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses structural equation modelling to test a hypothetical model. Data are gathered from a survey of 275 operations managers in Pakistan’s turbulent manufacturing industry. Findings: The findings suggest that the weaker direct effects of EO, in comparison to the indirect effects, indicate that an SCLO mediates the relationship between EO and DSCCs. Research limitations/implications: It is widely accepted that firms do not compete with each other, instead, it is end-to-end supply chains that fight for market dominance. Many scholars use the dynamic capabilities view to understand supply chain level competition. However, the dynamic capabilities view is firm-centric in its examination of how companies transform internal resources to compete in the external environment. The theoretical contribution of this paper is a roadmap of how to build dynamic, supply-chain level and capabilities by determining the key antecedents. This paper explains that DSCCs emerge when buyers and suppliers share strategic orientations. Firms with an EO and the ability to learn with supply chain partners are well-positioned to develop DSCCs. This provides a new angle to theory testing by indicating that dynamic capabilities are enabled by an EO and an ability to learn with supply chain partners. Practical implications: Managers are given the building blocks of DSCCs, starting with fostering an entrepreneurially-oriented mindset in the company and then learning with supply chain partners. Entrepreneurially-oriented managers are encouraged to take risks and co-develop innovative ideas with suppliers during the supply chain learning process. Originality/value: This study is one of the earliest efforts to determine the strategic orientations that antecede the emergence of DSCCs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082587803&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-02-2019-0074&partnerID=40&md5=53d69a7572b4f58ede2da79d7aa61c47,Scopus

One is that the global supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is overly dependent on few locations and large-scale batch manufacturing. Regulators hope to enable more dependable location decisions and improved processing quality with the adoption of advanced technologies such as process intensification through continuous manufacturing (CM). Conceptual work suggests that the benefits of shifting from batch to CM accrue end-to-end across the PSC. Yet detailed quantitative information about CM is limited at an early stage of evaluation, and too specialised to inform managerial decisions about PSC reconfiguration. Supply chain and engineering criteria are rarely combined in the early-stage evaluation of alternative CM technologies. Extant CM research typically overlooks implications for supply chain managers. To address the current gap, this article evaluates, at an early stage of adoption, alternative CM reactor technologies for the synthesis of APIs in selected therapeutic areas. With evidence from secondary data, relevant technologies and criteria are identified, and their relative importance is evaluated in a semi-quantitative fashion following analytical hierarchy process (AHP) principles, ensuring that findings are intelligible to both engineers and managers. The proposed empirical work enriches previous conceptual frameworks predicated on volume-variety considerations. Specifically, findings suggest that, all things considered, microreactor technologies outperform alternatives. However, PSC managerial considerations introduce nuances in specific therapeutic areas, for example, antivirals where a tension between complex chemistry and the need for flexibility in unit operations may favour batch manufacturing. For analgesics the need to exploit the existing manufacturing base whilst addressing inventory reduction favours technologies that incorporate elements of batch and CM. The proposed analysis is in line with real-world decisions that global medicines manufacturers are increasingly facing, as governments seek to develop local health countermeasures to the COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of detailed information. © 2021 The Authors.

Rather than seeking competitiveness through standardization as is common to lean production, real-options reasoning explores opportunities to use supply-chain variability as a strategic weapon. We present an illustrative case study of a Swiss manufacturer of cable extrusion equipment supported by a formal real-options model that aids in valuing the embedded options that make up supply-chain flexibility: postponement, contraction, expansion, switching, and abandonment. Real-options reasoning provides a plausible retrospective rationale for the case firm's use of supply-chain flexibility that provided protection against competition from low cost, but less responsive competitors. Their intuitive real-options reasoning facilitated incorporating fuller information concerning volatility, flexibility, and control into choosing what products to make, in what quantity, and with work allocated to which supplier. The case study also highlights how competing through exploiting embedded real options requires a different managerial skill set than does competing through cost reduction.

Recently, the Chinese $62 billion investment in the wake of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which includes a network of highways and railways projects, will be a milestone for regional connectivity. Through CPEC, China aims to connect its north-western province Xinjiang to global supply chain networks via Gwadar port Pakistan. Since 9/11, Pakistan has become a terrorism stuck state, resulting in the loss of political and economic stability, reducing the infrastructure development and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Under these circumstances, risk assessment of supply chain networks in a responsive way toward these problems is crucial for authorities. This paper aims to identify and investigate the relationship between supply chain risks using the Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) technique. Additionally, interdependencies among risks have been calculated, and classification is done via cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis based on corresponding dependency and driving power. Results show that political and economic stability has the highest driving power and lowest dependence power, indicating that all the risks are directly or indirectly associated with it. Simultaneously, epidemics and ecosystem changes have the highest dependence power and most insufficient driving power, which shows its significant dependency on other risks. Finally, based on our model, authorities can design a resilient supply chain network responsive to several risks, and efficient operations are assured. © 2021, Fudan University.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123160790&doi=10.1007%2fs41111-021-00199-w&partnerID=40&md5=959cbc8ab10dd8760c505b2ce5ccec61,Scopus

However, with the shift toward more dynamic and flexible supply chains, privacy concerns severely challenge the required information retrieval. A lack of trust between the different involved stakeholders inhibits advanced, multi-hop information flows, as valuable information for tracking and tracing products and parts is either unavailable or only retained locally. Our extensive literature review of previous approaches shows that these needs for cross-company information retrieval are widely acknowledged, but related work currently only addresses them insufficiently. To overcome these concerns, we present PrivAccIChain, a secure, privacy-preserving architecture for improving the multi-hop information retrieval with stakeholder accountability along supply chains. To address use case-specific needs, we particularly introduce an adaptable configuration of transparency and data privacy within our design. Hence, we enable the benefits of information sharing as well as multi-hop tracking and tracing even in supply chains that include mutually distrusting stakeholders. We evaluate the performance of PrivAccIChain and demonstrate its real-world feasibility based on the information of a purchasable automobile, the e.GO Life.

To address the calls of previous researchers, this study aims to explore the following relationships: engagement and alliance capability whilst data analytics capability plays a mediating role; the relationship between alliance and data analytics capability with sustainable supply chain flexibility whilst industry dynamism is considered as a moderating variable and the relationship between sustainable supply chain flexibility and circular economy-target performance. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey was performed and data was collected from 760 employees of Indian firms. Covariance-based structural equation modelling was applied to perform the path analysis to determine a firm’s capabilities in shaping sustainable supply chain flexibility and enhancing circular economy target performance. Findings: Drawing upon dynamic capability theory, it was first established that engagement capability has a positive and significant influence on alliance capability, whilst data analytics capability played a partial mediating role. Second, it was established that alliance capability and data analytics capability significantly affect sustainable supply chain flexibility, whilst industry dynamism played a moderating role. Finally, it was clear that sustainable supply chain flexibility had a significant and positive effect on circular economy target performance, ultimately enhancing sustainability. Originality/value: This study advances the circular economy literature by recommending that firms must consider some critical operational level capabilities to develop their dynamic capability, i.e. sustainable supply chain flexibility, to better meet the competitive market conditions in turbulent business environments. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117368636&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-05-2021-0246&partnerID=40&md5=daa911c8ae7c72efd025a673708b99a1,Scopus

First, the hypotheses were tested using data collected from 190 experienced respondents working in the healthcare industry. Our structural equation modeling analysis using the partial least squares (PLS) method revealed that BDA capabilities play a pivotal role in building a responsive HSC and improving innovation, which has contributed to resilience during the current pandemic situation. High innovation leadership strengthens the effect of BDA capabilities on HSC innovation. High innovation leadership also increases the effect of BDA capabilities on responsiveness. Second, we validated and supplemented the empirical research findings using inputs collected in 30 semistructured qualitative questionnaires. Our article makes a unique contribution from the perspective of innovation leaderships. In particular, we argue that the role of innovative leadership in the COVID-19 pandemic situation is critical as it indirectly affects HSC resilience when BDA is in place.

More specifically, on one hand, market factors strongly influence DRC, whereas, on the other hand, both management and technical factors influence at lower level DRC. DRC has a positive influence on supply chain resilience. Flexible orientation is found to positively moderate the effect of DRC on supply chain resilience, whereas control orientation does not exert any moderating effect on DRC and supply chain resilience.

Besides, studies suggest that a counterfeit DRAM can be more vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. However, detecting counterfeit DRAMs is very challenging because of their nature and ability to pass the initial testing. In this paper, we propose a technique to identify the DRAM origin (i.e., the origin of the manufacturer and the specification of individual DRAM) to detect and prevent counterfeit DRAM modules.

An effective way to manage uncertainty and variance in operational and organizational systems is by introducing greater flexibility. The literature on flexibility in reverse logistics is surprisingly sparse, with an explicit focus on flexibility in reverse logistics nonexistent in the literature. To address this gap in the literature, and building upon literature in supply chain flexibility, we introduce a reverse logistics flexibility framework. The framework is separated into operational and strategic flexibilities. Operational flexibility includes a variety of dimensions such as product and volume flexibility across various reverse logistics operational functions. We have also included strategic flexibility categorized into network and organizational design flexibility dimensions. Additional sub-dimensions are also included in the framework. The framework is useful for practical managerial decision making purposes such as process improvement or programmatic evaluation. The framework is also useful as a theoretical construct for reverse logistics empirical research. To exemplify the practical utility of the framework we introduce a performance evaluation of third party reverse logistics providers model using a novel neighborhood rough set approach. Using illustrative data, sensitivity results help evaluate the neighborhood rough set technique's robustness with various reverse logistics performance factors.

Modern organizations have to respond quickly to their customers' dynamic demands without compromising on quality, productivity and cost. Achieving agility lies in designing agile friendly processes and thus firms need to concentrate on their supply chains and its enablers in the attempt of redressing themselves as responsive supply chains. To evaluate and improve the levels of supply chain agility, a model called Total Agile Design System (TADS) is proposed. TADS as a methodology identifies supply chain enablers and prioritize them in order to achieve supply chain agility. In this scoring model, agility index before and after implementation of TADS are measured and discussed.

It is imperative and prudent to look at the overall product chain rather than focusing on any single supply chain entity. From a supply chain perspective, it is crucial that these individual entities are lean and agile (leagile) themselves, as well as the overall product value chain. As a result of the global nature of the product value chain, the concept of the decoupling point has undergone a paradigm shift. Through the literature review the authors establish three different types of decoupling point existing in product value chains, namely: (1) product structure decoupling point (PSDP), bill of materials decoupling; (2) supply structure decoupling point (SSDP), supply network decoupling; and (3) demand transfer decoupling point (DTDP), associated with information sharing. It is argued that such decoupling points are already an established and accepted phenomena, but have not been comprehensively discussed until now. It is proposed that, in the global supply chain, PSDP and SSDP are elemental decoupling points and DTDP is a logical decoupling, which is a function of PSDP and SSDP. It is proposed that DTDP swings between PSDP and SSDP and the swing direction is a critical piece of supply chain information that helps identify distortion. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) method is proposed to discover the relationship of DTDP with SSDP and PSDP using interpretation matrices and stress coefficients. Considering the supply chain as a fuzzy system, a combined effect of MDS over fuzzy applications has been used to determine the extent of swing of DTDP in the particular application of the supply chain. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862703799&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2011.588624&partnerID=40&md5=405be0d04bd768eba808b10e2b860836,Scopus

It is important because it stimulates innovation and growth and leads to effective decision making. Culture is a significant factor in this process and the role of people is critical. Successful Knowledge Management in any enterprise depends on the employees willing to share and invest their individual knowledge in the organization. Other factors are the business strategic priorities, top management support and technology, which may act as an enabler. We present a method for building a Knowledge Management framework utilizing Quality Function Deployment (QFD). The essence of the original QFD method was to extract the customer needs or desires expressed in his own words and to translate them into measurable product characteristics and further processing. The method has been enhanced and instead of being solely a technique for product design it became a technique for a variety of topics such as improvement of manufacturing systems, deployment of flexibility in supply chains and others. Our conceptual model has a top-down structure with QFD sequential matrices. It represents a research framework of an eventual empiric research for identifying important KM actions leading to improvement of the competitive and human advantages of an enterprise. We assume that the Knowledge Management improvement needs in an organization stem from its strategic improvement needs. To propagate the improvement needs from the strategic level to the action level, we develop two QFD matrices. The first matrix translates the strategic improvement needs into the knowledge improvement needs of an enterprise while the second one translates the knowledge improvement needs into prioritized KM improvement actions. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

It differentiates between two modelling perspectives: the bottom-up perspective (from the flexibility of elements to integrated flexibility) of the early researchers for modelling flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) and the more recent top-down perspective, from flexibility as a strategy to resources needed for implementing it. The bottom-up perspective is represented here by three papers. One paper focuses on Petri nets as a modelling tool, another offers a multi-factor design of experiments (DOE) view on factors affecting the performances of an FMS, and the third one presents a framework of logistic flexibility. The top-down perspective focuses on supply chain flexibility and uses quality function deployment (QFD) as a hierarchical modelling technique. An original framework for analysing the flexibility of generic objects, utilising cloud diagrams, is also presented. In all these papers a variety of changes that flexibility has to cope with are modelled, enabling the viewing of flexibility as a powerful ingredient for responding to changes and reducing risks in uncertain and changeable environments. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890557638&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2012.756593&partnerID=40&md5=c28512e54a7b04c5e27585a5eecbf0c7,Scopus

Communication in between other cars and pedestrians, which fulfills the requirements of the automotive lighting industry, is needed. A very promising lighting solution for this application are highly segmented organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Unfortunately, small area OLEDs are very sensitive to electrostatic discharge due to the small capacitance of the OLED segments. This study presents a solution for highly segmented OLEDs to fulfill automotive requirements regarding electrostatic discharge (ESD) without cost driving external components but through the improvement of the OLED itself. This solution is designed to be cheap and simple in fabrication, derived from standard photolithography to ensure no impact on existing supply chains and flexible OLED fabrication. After introducing the improved device concept for highly segmented OLEDs and its boundary conditions, a detailed view on the corresponding fabrication steps is given. The capacitive response of the protected OLED segments with respect to OLEDs without the introduced protection layer is characterized via impedance spectroscopy.

For a sine shape gas demand, three scenarios were further investigated: varying biogas production in time, adding gas storage to a supply chain, and adding a second digester to the supply chain which is assumed to be switched off during the summer months. A regional gas demand modeled by a sine function is reasonable for household type of users as well as for business areas, or a mixture of those.

Within these systems, food value chains are increasingly recognised as being vital for development, yet relatively little is known about the vulnerability of such chains to GCC, or their capacity to adapt. This paper provides a framework to examine how food value chains are affected by the uncertain impacts posed by GCC and what this implies for adaptation. While intervention models mostly deal with measures for producers, the authors hypothesise that adaptation strategies must include the entire chain to achieve the scale needed to tackle GCC. The authors propose that comprehensive situation assessment is necessary to examine both behaviour and assets—two key attributes for adaptive capacities. This framework examines three sets of attributes: (1) The general setup and nature of the supply chain; (2) rural livelihoods’ and food supply systems’ vulnerability to GCC, including downscaled crop suitability modelling to assess precise impacts of GCC, and (3) the behaviour of people and entities involved in value creation and the institutions mediating them.

We consider a model consisting of a manufacturer releasing a new product with uncertain release date and demand, and a retailer who must determine the allocation of limited capacity between a preexisting third-party product and the manufacturer's new product that may or may not be released on time. The manufacturer has a private forecast about the likelihood of the product release and/or about the demand, which he shares (either truthfully or not) with the retailer. We show that under the ""traditional"" supply chain structure (one-time opportunity to order) no truthful equilibrium can emerge. However, if (1) the supply chain structure allows for postponement, i.e., the ability to delay orders at a certain cost by the retailer, and (2) the manufacturer has informational uncertainty about the retailer's capacity, then truthful information exchange may emerge in equilibrium, where the manufacturer transmits his true forecast and the retailer treats the transmission as truthful. The genesis of this effect is preference reversal, where the manufacturer is not sure which way to distort the forecast to best motivate the retailer to wait for the new product. Thus, we show that a truth-revealing mechanism can emerge from a relatively rich setup featuring two-sided information asymmetry interacting with postponement. © 2018 INFORMS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066143702&doi=10.1287%2fmnsc.2017.3003&partnerID=40&md5=47ccf75dc33ba8501ef45931bd22cb23,Scopus

However, to leverage big data and achieve supply chain innovation, a variety of complementary resources are necessary. In this study, we hypothesise that supply chain innovation (SCI) is dependent on firms’ big data analytics capabilities (BAC). Furthermore, we propose that this relation is mediated by two crucial capabilities of agility and adaptability that enable firms to efficiently meet the challenges of supply chain ambidexterity. Finally, we also test the moderating role of technology uncertainty in our research model. We collected data from 386 manufacturing firms in Pakistan and tested our model using structural equation modelling. The results confirmed our initial hypotheses that agility and adaptability both mediated our baseline relationship of BAC and big data innovation in supply chains. We further found support for the moderating role of technology uncertainty. Furthermore, technology uncertainty moderates the relationship between BAC and SCI. This study extends the current literature on digital analytics capabilities and innovation along the supply chain. Practically, our research suggests that investment in big data can result in affirmative consequences, if firms cultivate capabilities to encounter supply chain ambidexterity through agility and adaptability. Accordingly, we suggest that managers belonging to manufacturing firms need to build up these internal capabilities and to monitor and assess technology uncertainty in the environment. © 2022, The Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131335344&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-022-04772-7&partnerID=40&md5=2780fbd2cc615c014e4546811750e3da,Scopus

The contract allows the retailer to adjust the initial order quantity after the partial or full resolution of demand uncertainty, which helps the retailer reduce supply–demand mismatches. We use the multiplicative martingale model of forecast evolution to analyze the impact of lead-time reduction on the value of quantity flexibility for the retailer. We find that the shorter the lead time, the higher the value of quantity flexibility. Quantity flexibility may, however, also cause supply chain disintermediation problems for the retailer, such as the supplier bypassing the retailer and selling its products directly to end customers. We incorporate the “contracts as reference points” theory into our quantity flexibility contract model to capture the impact of supply chain disintermediation on the retailer's profit. This approach allows us to analyze the trade-off between decreasing supply–demand mismatches and increasing supply chain disintermediation problems. We show that the impact of lead-time reduction on decreasing the disintermediation risk highly depends on the critical fractile.

The paper attempts to measure comprehensive relative reconfigurability index (CRRI) in an automobile case supply chain by holistically considering fifteen enablers of reconfigurability. The present research evaluates CRRI by utilizing two distinct assessment models that calculate relative reconfigurability index (RRI). Firstly, a deterministic assessment model is developed from the total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) digraph, and secondly, an integrated assessment methodology that utilizes both the Delphi technique and the additive weighting method to calculate RRI. The uniqueness of the present research is to quantify reconfigurability in the case supply chain by a numerical index termed as CRRI. The paper analyzes the level of reconfigurability competence of the case supply chain in comparison with an ideal supply chain and thus facilitates structural flexibility. The proposed model for calculating CRRI, using two methodologies and comparing the results, is an innovative way of measuring supply chain reconfigurability.

The paper also addresses five reconfigurability dimensions in the perspective of supply chains and the major enablers to attain them. The paper further aims to understand the mutual interactions among these enablers through the identification of hierarchical relationships among them. Design/methodology/approach: A framework that holistically considers all the major enablers of reconfigurability has been developed. The hierarchical interrelationships between major enablers have been presented and interpreted using a novel qualitative modeling technique, i.e., total interpretive structural modeling (TISM), which is an extension of ISM. SPSS 22.0 is employed to carry out a one-tailed one-sample t-test further to test the hypotheses for validating the results of TISM. Impact matrix cross-reference multiplication applied to a classification (MICMAC) analysis has been employed to identify the driving and dependence powers of these reconfigurability enablers. Findings: In this paper, 15 enablers for reconfigurability paradigm have been identified through literature review and expert opinions. The authors established interrelationships and interdependencies among these enablers and categorized them as enablers of each dimension. New product development and customer satisfaction come at the highest level of priority. The levels of these enablers were obtained using TISM. The authors compared the results with the clusters derived from MICMAC analysis, and the results are found to be well within the acceptable range. Research limitations/implications: The study has implications for both practitioners and academia. The work provides a comprehensive list of enablers that are relevant to reconfigure supply chains in today’s volatile global market. This research will also help decision makers to strategically focus on the top-level enablers and their concerned dimensions. The research is based on an automobile company case study and can be extended to products with volatile and changing demands. Originality/value: The proposed model for reconfigurability enablers using TISM is a new effort altogether in the area of supply chain management. The novelty of this research lies in its identification of specific enablers to reconfigure a supply chain through different dimensions. © 2017, 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059570447&doi=10.1108%2fJAMR-09-2016-0071&partnerID=40&md5=284a71113ce668f9af3122e8774def51,Scopus

We test our hypotheses with data collected from procurement and supply chain professionals in Germany. Pursuant to our expectations, we find a positive and significant influence of internal and external knowledge transfer on supply chain flexibility. We further confirm a negative moderating effect of supply complexity on the relationship between internal knowledge transfer and supply chain flexibility, and a negative moderating effect of product complexity on the relationship between external knowledge transfer and supply chain flexibility.

There are two apparent strategic paths. Under circumstances of strong price pressure, there is demand for standardized TPL services offering simplicity, minimalism and functionality based on digitalization, e-commerce and servitization. Alternatively, with market developments responsive to supply chain complexity, digitalization, e-commerce and servitization enable development towards innovation and change. We conclude that these developments do not invalidate existing frameworks for TPL strategies but contribute alternative strategies. We formulate three propositions for each strategic path.

Disruptive technologies such as Blockchain and theInternet of things (IoT) are one of the main pillars that are driving this revolution. The integration of decentralised networks and automated workflows has the potential to become a pivotal factor in construction projects, especially in supply chain ecosystems within the off-site manufacturing field. Obstacles related to fragmented information, interoperability, transparency and “big data” management are the main drivers for change that the industry needs to address. Whilst organisations and users can automate workflows and processes by utilising IoT technology to transfer data without human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction, the interaction, storage and management of the data generated are not safe or reliable. Design/methodology/approach: The approach outlined in this paper addresses the challenges that IoT and centralised networks present. Blockchain, a peer-to-peer distributed database, offers the possibility to support and maintain the asset information without interruptions in all the stages of the life cycle. The synergy between these technologies, along with other techniques, methods and platforms (such as building information modeling (BIM)), based on a single environment, will support information traceability from the strategic definition to end of life. Findings: The framework of this study presents an excellent opportunity to apply new workflows and processes with the application of new technologies and protocols. It benefits from a well-established platform such as BIM to enable the coordination and management of digital assets as well as giving illustration and collaboration to the supply chain members. IoT and Blockchain are the other layers that work together with the third layer (BIM). This framework proposed the use of these platforms to ensure the information traceability of physical and digital assets, data automation and information management, in a dynamic supply chain ecosystem, bringing efficiency and transparency to stakeholders and users. Practical implications: This study provides an exploratory framework to be used by the supply chain members in offsite manufacturing, and the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry in general, to track asset information throughout their entire life cycle securely and transparently.

Previous approaches on the analysis of supply chain risks have been proposed but have drawbacks that may provide counterintuitive results. Thus, this study attempts to develop a methodological approach based on supply-driven input-output analysis with fuzzy parameters in order to address supply chain risk analysis.

While much of the fashion industry follows the logics of global production networks, this paper presents a case where small, independent firms have chosen instead to engage with local production networks. Drawing on interviews with 87 independent fashion designers and key informants, this paper examines the following question: In the context of global production, why do independent fashion designers choose to work locally? In answering this question, three key findings are presented: the motivations of designers who emphasize timeless design and high-quality local manufacturing; the strategies employed by designers to cultivate exclusivity and loyalty through the distribution of their collections; and the ways in which unique consumption experiences are utilized to articulate the values of their brand to consumers. While operating outside of the traditional fashion system provides independent fashion designers with the space for creativity, innovation, and control over their brand, it will be argued it also creates challenges with respect to growth beyond their niche market. © 2017 Canadian Association of Geographers / L'Association canadienne des géographes",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027713171&doi=10.1111%2fcag.12400&partnerID=40&md5=45676a5a9a1fc731435fe94ffbb0047c,Scopus

We start by analyzing a consignment contract with a revenue-sharing agreement in which a manufacturer decides both the price and the quality investment while the retailer sets the store advertising efforts. The manufacturer is the brand owner and increases the goodwill through quality and pricing. We solve three dynamic games, in which the manufacturer is the Stackelberg leader, and compare the related solutions. We discover that the manufacturer, as chain leader, will always propose the adoption of a coordination mechanism. When the manufacturer opts for a cooperative program, the retailer is always economically better off; thus, a cooperative program is always profit-Pareto-improving. When the manufacturer opts for a price discount mechanism, the retailer is always economically worse-off because the discount applies only to her margins. Nevertheless, the price discount mechanism is profit-Pareto-improving in the case of high production cost: The price discount allows for considerably reducing the retail price, which translates to a substantial increase in demand. In all other cases, the retailer sets zero price discount, thus preferring a non-coordinated framework. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065701385&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2019.04.027&partnerID=40&md5=6794adf30906e40afdfcde6a1f68ba8c,Scopus

The research design is based on primary data from a survey of 168 industrial buyer-seller relationships which map a broad set of dimensions of the economic transactions and structures in these business-to-business relationships. The empirical findings provide support for the hypotheses, and demonstrate that the effect of the buyer-specific monitoring procedures is positively associated with buyer control arrangements under conditions with rather modest external disturbances.

The authors can identify four types of supplier interfaces: Interactive, translation, specified and standardized ones. The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors explaining the diversification of these relationships between aircraft manufacturers and their suppliers, through the example of Airbus suppliers. Design/methodology/approach - Network analysis (to define the complexity level of aircraft components), data analysis (to characterize the diversity of aircraft suppliers) and a logit model were combined in order to link the supplier interfaces to the complexity of components and to the suppliers' characteristics. Findings - It is shown that the earlier a supplier is involved in the development process, the more responsibility is delegated to him and the more intertwined its relationship is with the prime contractor. Also, it is shown that component complexity plays a major role in a supplier's involvement during the integral design and face-to-face interactions matter greatly during the co-design phases of the products. Research limitations/implications - The research has rather a static perspective covering all the inter-firm relations within Airbus programs at once. By using the same databases, one could look into the evolution of supplier interfaces within the aeronautical supply chain. A dynamic view would provide some evidence regarding the recent restructuring of the supply chain.

According to the contract, the manufacturer is able to expedite or postpone the delivery if the retailer makes such a request. Hence, the retailer has the flexibility to modify the lead time by using the most up-to-date demand information. The optimal lead time policy is found to be a threshold-type policy. The sensitivity analysis also shows that R is much more sensitive to the change of lead time than Q, and thus, the paper is primarily focused on finding optimal R. We also provide a cost approximation which yields unimodal cost in R. Furthermore, we analyze the order crossing problem and derive an upper bound for the probability of order crossing.

The innovation of this paradigm is the possibility to configure a supply chain characterized by: flexibility, availability of a tool for support decisional system, ""on demand"" production and manufacturing capabilities considered as services. This paper reports an innovative application of the Cloud Manufacturing paradigm that has expected the definition a tool web-based that allows to configure the client requests and the relative supply chain considering the best available solutions. In particular, the developed system, called AMSA (Additive Manufacturing Spare parts market Application) have had as main goal the definition of a common platform to supply different kind of services: product development oriented to the Additive Manufacturing (DFAM, Design For Additive Manufacturing), production of prototype or small series with Additive Manufacturing and reverse engineering activities to obtain CAD models starting from a physical object. The definition of different kind of services allow to satisfy several client needs such as: necessity to define an innovative product characterized by high performance in terms of stiffness/weight ratio, possibility to manufacture small series, such as in the motorsport field, and possibility to define CAD models for the obsolete parts for which the geometrical information are missed. AMSA platform relies on the reconfigurable supply chain that is dynamic and it depends on the particular client needs. For example, when the client requires the manufacture of a small series of a particular component, AMSA allows to the technicians to choose the best solutions in terms of price and distance. Therefore, the suppliers that contribute to the definition of the dynamic supply chain have an important role. The AMSA platform, for these reasons, represents an important tool able to link the suppliers to the customers in the best manner in order to obtain service that are characterized an high performance level. © 2019 Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068859985&doi=10.1063%2f1.5112680&partnerID=40&md5=1849e08102344f1bcae974a40c695867,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative approach, using document analysis and in-depth interviews with industry specialists. Findings: Ultra-fast fashion differs from fast in the following supply chain strategies: avoids any excess inventory, focuses on local manufacturing, on-demand production, and shorter lead times from a few days to a week with a combination of agile, lean, responsive supply chain strategies. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this research are due to the cut-off period and the use of a restricted sample. As implications, technological capabilities are underexplored in the fashion industry. Although important to the traditional and fast fashion industry, technology is viewed as a tool and not as a capability that can generate competitive advantage. This paper addresses technology as capabilities to make ultra-fast fashion retailers more competitive. Practical implications: Ultra-fast fashion could potentially impact current fast fashion retailers to partially move their business model and operations towards an ultra-fast approach. Fast fashion retailers desiring to speed up their production processes launch more weekly collections to cater to consumers who are more fashion-conscious.

Especially, there is still a limited understanding of the importance of firms’ supply chain flexibility, resilience and responsiveness in the supply chain risk management (SCRM) literature. This research focuses on exploring the relationship between significant proactive risk mitigation strategies, namely supply chain (SC) flexibility, resilience and responsiveness, as well as SCRM performance to facilitate bridging the gap between mitigation strategies and SCRM performance. The moderating role of risk management (RM) culture was also hypothesized and tested. Design/methodology/approach: A survey-based methodology is adopted. The data are analyzed using the technique of partial least squares. Findings: The results indicate that SC resilience and responsiveness are positively associated with SCRM performance; however, SC flexibility does not. In addition, interestingly, RM culture does not moderate these relationships in spite of the extant literature. We argue that this could be due to the fact that risk management culture is at the beginning stage for an enterprise in Turkey.

From this perspective, we investigate the value of proportional order-up-to policies (POUT) policies and the adjustment of their inventory controllers in these systems. These policies are often used to improve the performance of traditional supply chains due to their ability to cope with the damaging bullwhip effect; however, they have not been sufficiently studied in CLSCs. Through a difference equation modelling approach, we show that POUT policies are also a valuable instrument for enhancing the CLSC dynamics. Specifically, we find that the POUT model outperforms the traditional order-up-to policy in a hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system, yielding significant cost savings. To optimise the key trade-off between order and inventory variability, the tuning of the inventory controllers needs to consider not only the cost structure of the CLSC but also the average return rate. Specifically, managers should react to increasing levels of circularity by lowering the setting of the controllers’ time constant. In the light of our findings, we suggest two strategies for aligning the calibration of the POUT controllers and the forecasting methods to increase the economic performance of CLSCs. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099421563&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2020.1867924&partnerID=40&md5=21aff9da51a828e1fd0f7e66050c3fa6,Scopus

All of a sudden, the lives of Italians were forced to shift in accordance with the regulations issued by government. This change in the lives of Italians can be mirrored by an adjustment in food consumer behaviour that, consequently, brought about a transition in the whole supply chain. This paper gives an overview of the recent changes in consumption patterns that occurred due to the Italian lockdown, and how evolutions in behaviour are intertwined with the evolution of the main food supply chains. Many of the events here depicted are likely to last far beyond the crisis and affect the subsequent evolution of food consumption in Italy. The Italian retail supply chain successfully adapted to the big shift in consumption. Despite purchases for essential items having increased, no stockout harmed the food security of Italians. Out-of-home consumption moved inside houses giving space to home meal preparation and comfort food. Home delivery has been the most important element in this context, as it boomed during this period, helping laggard consumers fill the digital divide, as it was mostly mediated by e-commerce platforms and instant messaging. It was also the leverage that allowed small retailers and small producers regain their space. This crisis calls for a more sustainable food system that will be increasingly oriented to moving goods rather than people, which will also have relevance in the coming years. © 2020 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097450740&doi=10.1016%2fj.heliyon.2020.e05676&partnerID=40&md5=b597dc0f89111446a3b4a83c08e54e51,Scopus

The present study attempts to address this issue by employing a resource-based perspective as a lens for exploring the major antecedents and consequences of supply chain agility at both the strategic and operational levels. Drawing on a review of the extant literature, we argue that two organizational flexibility factors – strategic flexibility and manufacturing flexibility – are the critical antecedents to supply chain agility. In addition, supply chain agility, strategic flexibility, and manufacturing flexibility are all significant factors in firm performance. A conceptual framework for the arguments was developed and tested through an empirical study of selected industrial practitioners. Data from a sample of 141 garment manufacturers were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results reveal that both strategic flexibility and manufacturing flexibility positively influence supply chain agility. However, strategic flexibility has a direct and significant influence on firm performance while manufacturing flexibility does not. Furthermore, supply chain agility plays an important role in mediating the effects of both strategic and manufacturing flexibilities on firm performance. The findings of the present study add to the understanding of supply chain management, with a focus on supply chain agility in the fashion manufacturing industry. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007000872&doi=10.1016%2fj.ejor.2016.11.006&partnerID=40&md5=5631ffb877ada65a214b76fe83310b2a,Scopus

Nevertheless, one of the ensuing key challenges of flexible-electronics-based sensing is the issues associated with consistency and repeatability of its parameters of the flexible electronics elements/sensors due to their variations, which are sometimes intractable. These may be due to manufacturing variations, aging, when the substrate is bent, and so on. In this article, we describe our codesign between the different chains of the flexible electronics supply chain to derive practically flexible electronics and sensors for applications where the substrate is expected to bend, e.g., in an augmented sensing e-skin smart glove application. This effort includes our fully additive lowerature all-air low-cost screen printing process, and how we obtain consistency and repeatability. To improve the matching of thin-film transistors - a critical consideration for conditioning sensor outputs - we describe layout techniques where relatively good matching can be achieved, but with area overheads. We describe how we accommodate the variations of printed elements and circuits embodying printed elements when the substrate is bent - a self-compensating means - and propose the application of the same for printed sensors. The cost of our self-compensation means is without power or area overheads, albeit more (uncomplicated) printing steps. We finally describe our process development kit (PDK) encompassing all of the aforesaid to predict the performance of the printed circuits and sensors, including the effects of bending and our proposed self-compensation thereto.

The major components of this study are based on reviews of marketing research that focus on influence strategies and literature regarding supply chain flexibility. The results show that the request strategy has a negative effect on supplier delivery flexibility. The model predicts that trust and shared vision have an asymmetrical effect across recommendations, information exchange, and promises influence strategies. When the relationship contains a highly shared vision, a manufacturer's use of the recommendation influence strongly promotes supplier delivery flexibility, whereas the use of a promise strategy depresses supplier delivery flexibility. In contrast, an information exchange strategy will have a negative effect, but the promise strategy will have a positive effect on supplier delivery flexibility when trust is high.

The purpose of the paper is to address the following research questions: (1) What are the optimal pricing policies and green strategies of the dynamic decentralized supply chain with the competitive or supportive retail service? (2) How does the dynamic consumer's perception of green product affect these equilibrium solutions? Design/methodology/approach: The paper establishes the dynamic game models and then derives a firm's instantaneous and steady-state feedback equilibrium solutions in three scenarios as follows: (1) the integrated supply chain; (2) the decentralized supply chain with competitive retail service and (3) the decentralized supply chain with supportive retail service. Finally, we conduct numerical analyses to compare the firm's instantaneous and steady-state equilibrium solutions and profit in the three scenarios. Findings: The theoretical and numerical analysis results suggest that the supportive retail service is less inefficient than the competitive retail service in the decentralized supply chain and that the types of retail service have no influence on the green strategy. Moreover, a firm's myopia leads to lowering the greenness degree, retail service level and severe price competition, resulting in economic losses. Consumers’ initial perception of greenness degree determines whether the retailer should adopt the skimming pricing strategy or penetration pricing strategy. Furthermore, only when consumers’ perception of greenness degree is higher than a threshold, will the manufacturer produce green product with positive greenness degree. Originality/value: This is one of few studies on the effect of different types of retail service on horizontal competition in green supply chain. The extension of the static study by adopting differential game approaches provides researchers with a deeper understanding of the application of retail service in green supply chain. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085125045&doi=10.1108%2fAPJML-07-2019-0423&partnerID=40&md5=8c0ba98fd75ab7265bc0b00b5594683f,Scopus

The properties of optimal solutions for special cases of the problem involving one and two case packs are first established and these properties are used to solve the problem via dynamic programming. For the general model with multiple predefined case packs, which is shown to be strongly NP-hard, the exact approach is generalized to solve the problem in pseudopolynomial time for a fixed number of case packs. In addition, for large-size problems, the problem formulation is strengthed using valid inequalities and a family of heuristic solutions is designed. Computational tests show that these heuristic approaches perform very well compared to the commercial mixed-integer programming solver CPLEX.

We draw on the organizational learning perspective to examine how inter-organizational systems (IOS) enabled collaborative knowledge creation can enhance the supply chain flexibility. Empirical results from 141 supply chain enterprises support most of our hypotheses. The results show that, (1) IOS use for exploration has positive effects on supply chain flexibility and collaborative knowledge creation plays a partially mediated role between them; (2) Market uncertainty moderates the relationship between IOS use for exploration for collaborative knowledge creation. And (3) under the greater uncertainty in the market environment, the relationship between company's collaborative knowledge creation and supply chain flexibility becomes stronger. This result suggests when supply chain enterprises face market uncertainty, they need to improve the level of IOS use for exploration to facilitate understanding of the market, which will improve the supply chain flexibility.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011034452&partnerID=40&md5=55e287cfae98a8ac13c6eee78aebb23a,Scopus

In order to solve the problem of relatively few traditional software functions, frequent switching of various systems is required, which is very troublesome to use. In order to overlap with high-precision rainfall prediction and obtain prediction accuracy, wavelet neural network and NARX dynamic neural network are used to predict rainfall tendency and rainfall, and the error of overlap prediction is analyzed. This method can provide high-precision prediction of rainfall and ensure the dynamic stability of the slope. The survey results show that there is an obvious correlation between the functional effects of the enterprise logistics management information system and the elasticity of the supply chain network. In other words, the application of logistics management information system can make the elasticity of the enterprise supply chain network lower. Then, this article analyzes the internal cooperation risks and external risks of the supply chain network and proposes a dual-cycle mode of supply chain network risk management. What is important is that each member of the supply chain network must design and sign contracts and establish a contract mechanism for risk sharing. Study the experienced risk events, and establish a learning mechanism. In order to improve the adaptability of the supply chain to the environment, a corresponding elastic mechanism needs to be established. Establish an emergency response mechanism to respond to emergency situations in a timely manner. At the same time, the government establishes a public mechanism to improve the ability of the supply chain network to deal with external risks, and ultimately can manage the risks of the supply chain network flexibly, and improve the risk prevention capabilities of the enterprise supply chain. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107177349&doi=10.1007%2fs12517-021-07418-3&partnerID=40&md5=11241c0c9d9617c019316a12adbd4ad9,Scopus

The present paper is an attempt to review the developments in the realm of SCM over the past two decades. In the domain of SCM maturity, different models, dimensions (areas) and approaches are advanced for maturity measurements. Methods: Research studies conducted and presented in the literature, including papers on conference proceedings, articles in journals and technical reports, are reviewed; the review covers a time span from the early 1990s to the present time (2019). Also provided in this review are the previous models, dimensions (areas/ elements), and approaches for measuring SCM maturity techniques. Additionally, research gaps are identified, analysed and discussed. Results: After reviewing, the research studies in the field and the dimensions found in the works are placed into different categories. The current study aims to present a review of the literature, ultimately providing help to researchers in realizing gaps and opportunities in the field of SCM maturity. There are also different approaches to supply chain maturity models. For example, one approach may solely focus on integration while another might concentrate on SC visibility and traceability. In more recent research studies, more attention is paid to such specific areas of supply chain as flexibility and sustainability. The results of the present paper point to gaps, which indicate that more research works are required. In addition, it is assumed that the materials presented here may help establish more comprehensive SCM maturity models. Conclusions: It is seen that supply chain management is rapidly shifting toward e-SCM, and some other technologies like blockchain. Also, supply chain sustainability comes to the fore as a significant approach. It should be reminded that other strategic features of supply chains like leanness, agility, resilience, sustainability, integration, green and reverse logistics etc., also play their own role in the field. Combining these strategic features can be an effective idea for developing more comprehensive models for SCM maturity. To sum up, the results of the present survey indicate that the published works need more adequacy and treatment research, and that more research is called for to bridge the gaps in the realm of SCM maturity. © Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077539839&doi=10.17270%2fJ.LOG.2020.377&partnerID=40&md5=374c7baf88e86e02533ba88c5784d255,Scopus

This mat is opaque when refrigerated due to nanofiber-induced light scattering, but becomes irreversibly transparent at room temperature through self-healing-induced interfibrillar fusion leading to the appearance of a warning sign. The mat monitors both freezer (−20 °C) and chiller (2 °C) successions and its timer is tunable over the 0.5–22.5 h range through control of the polymer composition and film thickness.

The traditional supply chains are dynamic systems which include the forward and reverse flows of physical products and the related information and fund. However, a service supply chain is different because the real ""product"" may take the form of a ""service"" which implies that many traditionally crucial decisions in supply chain management such as product shipping problems are no longer important. Here, a service supply chain is defined as a supply network that transfers resources into services or servitised products, with or without physical products, to satisfy customer needs. As a result, managing a service supply chain system requires innovative strategies with new models. Currently, there is an absence of a comprehensive reference source that provides the state-of-the-art findings on this important topic. It will thus be significant to develop a well-balanced edited volume that includes both theoretical results (from different perspectives) and application cases/studies on service supply chain systems.

Industry 4.0 causes upheaval and forces businesses to reconsider how they build their supply chains. A number of new technologies have developed that are disrupting traditional working practices. Agility is a critical component of business success in complex industrial environments because it allows companies to compete effectively in a competitive market. Firms are increasing relying on information systems in achieving such agility throughout the supply chain. The chain becomes a fully connected ecosystem that is fully transparent to all parties involved, from raw material, component, and part suppliers through transporters of those supplies and completed items, and lastly to the customers expecting fulfilment, thanks to digitization. This chapter aims to explain the framework of digitization in agile supply chain management. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128104814&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-0240-6_5&partnerID=40&md5=127df2cf686177453a8c8c5df73bff1c,Scopus

A biorefinery offers the advantage of converting a remarkable variety of biomass feedstocks to different types of biofuels and biochemicals. A great extent of rigorous effort is currently being made for the upgrading of existing biorefinery frameworks to fully attain the sustainability standards required to warrant their full-scale implementation. As a consequence of the mandatory inclusion of the sustainability goals into the biorefinery concept and the escalating concern on the ‘food-fuel conflict’, the second generation (2G) of biorefineries are garnering quick popularity over their first-generation counterparts. In India, there exist huge prospects of development of 2G biorefineries exploiting the abundant resources of the lignocellulosic agro-wastes. Indian agro-wastes display an extraordinary variety of lignocellulosic biomass and round-the-year availability in copious amounts. Unfortunately, due to lack of awareness and poor valorization, these valuable agro-wastes are often destroyed in mass scale for waste management instead of being utilized in a productive way. The major focus of the present chapter is to present a categorical classification of Indian agro-wastes based on their appearance in the supply chain. The adaptability of Indian agro-wastes towards 2G biorefinery has been assessed using their availability, thermochemical properties and composition of a few specific feedstocks, namely, rice straw, rice husk, wheat straw, oil seed press cakes, sugarcane bagasse, coconut shell, banana peels and stems. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been used to decide on the strategy of application of stand-alone biochemical or thermochemical processes and their hybrids for the conversion of different candidate feedstocks in the 2G biorefineries with respect to sustainability parameters. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039169184&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-10-7188-1_16&partnerID=40&md5=3890cd9c5fd6f1732b5f4c63ab83a8ea,Scopus

The manufacturing and retailing firms engage in an oligopolistic, noncooperative game by sharing customer demand such that a firm's decisions impact the product prices, which in turn result in changes in all other firms' decisions. Each firm's payoff is to maximize its own profit and we show that, in response to such changes in prices and to exogenous environmental taxes, the manufacturing firms may strategically alter a variety of choices such as 'make-buy' decisions with respect to intermediate inputs, spatial distribution of production, product shipment patterns and inventory management, environmental tax payment vs recycling decisions, and timing of all such choices to sustainably manage the profit and the environmental regulations. An important implication is that effects of a tax depends on the oligopolistic game structure. With respect to methods, we show that this dynamic game can be represented as a set of differential variational inequalities (DVIs) that motivate a computationally efficient nonlinear complementarity (NCP) approach that enables the full exploitation of above-mentioned salient features. We also provide a numerical example that confirms the utility of our proposed framework and shows substantial strategic reaction can be expected to a tax on pollution stocks. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Despite its importance, the literature on SCF is limited. In group decision-making problems, the experts have their different backgrounds, experience, and knowledge. The experts use different linguistic term sets with different cardinalities (multi-granularity linguistic term sets) to express individual assessment information. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a new fuzzy fusion method to deal with the heterogeneous group of experts problem with multi-granularity linguistic assessment information, and used to improve the SCF evaluation process. The results of this study are more objective and unbiased for two reasons. First, the results are generated by heterogeneous group decision-making with multi-granularity linguistic assessment information. Second, the fuzzy linguistic approach has more advantage to preserve no loss of information. Additionally, an example using a case study is used to illustrate the availability of the proposed method.

When civil unrest swept the UK in August 2011, the effect on business was stark, losing the retail sector £300m in unexpected costs and lost revenues. On the other side of the world, the natural disaster that hit Japan in early 2011 is estimated to have run up costs in the region of £189bn in repairs. Beyond this, the earthquake and its aftermath shattered supply chains, with technology companies expecting delays of up to six months before business could resume fully. It is impossible to predict incidents like these, but businesses can help mitigate disruption in the supply chain by undertaking business continuity management (BCM). A flexible supply chain is essential when it comes to BCM - whether it means being able to cope with altering transport routes at short notice, or finding or replacing a supplier at the last minute. Understanding the supply chain is critical when responding to major impacts that affect supply chains in multiple points - like IT system failures and country-wide fuel strikes. Businesses should carry out detailed business impact assessments and risk assessments right across the end-to-end supply chain and not just at key single points of failure. It is an intensive process that needs dedicated resources and ownership at the highest level. Recognising this, DHL has designed a 10-step process, which it has implemented across its global supply chain business.

So Svizzera 185, Torino, Italy","The integrated analysis of quality and production logistics in manufacturing systems has recently attracted increasing interest among researchers and industrialists. It has been shown that several links exist among the manufacturing system design and the product quality, which are dominated by complex dynamic interactions. However, these interactions have never been addressed in manufacturing systems producing perishable products. The quality characteristics of perishable products deteriorate over time. Several examples of this phenomenon are found in the food industry, in semiconductor manufacturing, and in polymers forming processes. If the time parts spend in the system exceeds a certain threshold the inventory becomes obsolete and defective parts need to be scrapped. A similar problem is also found in highly dynamic supply chains. In this paper, we provide an analytical method to model the dynamics of this phenomenon in a buffered two-machines line with general Markovian machines. The main contribution is a method for the calculation of the lead time distribution, that allows us to derive predictions of the effective throughout and scrap rate. In case of two-state machines the approach leads to symbolic expressions while in case of general Markovian machines numerical solutions can be obtained. Numerical results provide relevant insights on the problem and show counterintuitive behaviors paving the way to the design of buffers for product quality. © 2014 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84970913619&doi=10.1109%2fETFA.2014.7005201&partnerID=40&md5=8257be1794ecc5531d6a2eb20bfaa587,Scopus

It seeks to explain consumer decisions and the probability of changes occurring in wine expenditure compared to a normal situation. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis, conducted on a representative sample of Iberian consumers and based on the random utility theory, consists in the application of a multinomial logit model, setting the “usual” pattern of expenditure as a baseline category. Findings: The results show that the coronavirus pandemic could have changed alcohol drinking habits. Consumers generally spent less on wine during the lockdown, maybe due to the uncertainty regarding their future income and professional situation. Those people more likely to spend more on wine were those who increased their wine consumption during the lockdown, those who drank for romantic purposes, those who purchased less wine in supermarkets but more online, those who used a wine app and those living in urban areas. The increased consumption of other alcoholic beverages also increases the probability of spending less than usual on wine. Additionally, the absence of certain reasons for drinking wine other than social purposes, such as wine and food pairing, its taste and relaxing effects, together with the previous consumption pattern leads to a decrease in the probability of spending less per bottle. Originality/value: This paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of the determinants of wine consumption in a very abnormal setting, an imposed lockdown and provides important policy implications. The findings show that managers and policymakers should pay attention to the different influence of variables related to behaviour and consumption patterns that may contribute to an increase in the demand for less expensive wines. Specifically, they should focus on new consumption patterns that may arise, adapting the supply chain and defining appropriate marketing strategies to fill new market segments. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115775446&doi=10.1108%2fBFJ-03-2021-0258&partnerID=40&md5=daa24e32463de6021c79275b7cc01cd5,Scopus

This chapter illustrates the findings of a research that was conducted at European level to assess the state of the art of servitization in the machine tool sector and to outline future challenges. Through quantitative research, five clusters of machine tool servitizers were identified, distinguished by the type of service value proposition and the service supply chain configuration. Clusters outlined that, even if the offering of services is very spread in this sector, the servitization process is far from being mature. In fact, the type of offered services are mainly product-related services, many servitizers resulted not to have adapted their supply chain to the service business, and the most advanced service strategies observed in the sample did not lead to additional financial benefits. To allow the in-depth interpretation of these findings, qualitative research aimed at understanding the cultural and managerial approach of clustered servitizers was conducted. A conservative cultural approach was recognized as a strong barrier to servitization. It generally derives from low service competences, but it can also be generated by customers' unbalanced contractual power, which forces machine builders to enter the service arena without being prepared. Case study research permitted also to identify few companies being a successful example of advanced servitization. By analysing their example, it was clear that a proactive attitude to service innovation and the approach to servitization as a multidisciplinary structured change management project can represent a key-success factor.

The use of composite materials may give the opportunity to improve the technical specifications of a manufactured module and also impact the configuration of the supply chain. However, this represents a challenging decision-making process as various technologies are available for the manufacturing of composite materials. This paper proposes a design process based on the identification of the bill of materials of a component where the substitution of certain sub-assemblies using composite materials may result in the reduction of parts, operations and suppliers. The design process is supported by a customized software tool that generates a graphic representation of the bill of materials of the selected module, allowing users to choose a specific sub-assembly, select composite materials process types and identify potential suppliers from a database. An industry case involving the production of a module used in urban buses/long distance coach manufacturing is employed to illustrate the proposed design process.

Such a varying production capacity is further exacerbated by the machine breakdowns that may occur in the manufacturing system. Since the two products share the same production system, a production planning rule has to be executed to decide the change-over, i.e. to select the product to be manufactured over time. An extended experimental campaign has been performed to investigate how the fill rate and the standard deviation of inventories vary as a series of operational and tactical parameters changes. Several ANOVA analyses revealed a strong interaction between the production planning model and the adopted smoothing replenishment strategy, which remarkably affects the performance of the SC. Interestingly, a higher value of the proportional controller negatively affects the service levels since the adopted production planning policy, under these circumstances, tends to encourage longer production runs for a certain product and, consequently, persistent stock outs for the other one. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097436857&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2020.1852480&partnerID=40&md5=3351061605f352c0922512724bb04dff,Scopus

This intersectional review exposes a substantial conceptual contradiction between the perspectives reported by various researchers. Further, the current paper classifies the literature into four categories according to the broad objectives investigated by the research papers. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, a bibliometric analysis aligned with the concepts of a systematic literature review is conducted followed by a descriptive review focusing on models and methods. The software called BibExcel is utilized to extract and analyze the bibliographic information in a textual form from the research articles associated with strategic capabilities of the logistics sector. The results are exported to the software known as Gephi to visualize keyword co-occurrence analysis as networks. A well-structured descriptive review is also conducted to identify avenues for future research. Findings: Despite conventional supply chain capabilities like efficiency and effectiveness, eight significant strategic capabilities of supply chains for managing risks are identified from the literature. These capabilities with positive connotations include flexibility, reliability, resilience, robustness, agility, adaptability, alignment and responsiveness. Considering the vast literature on flexibility/reliability along with its numerous dimensions and scope, the authors found that resilience, robustness, agility, adaptability, alignment and effectiveness are achievable through flexibility/reliability. Accordingly, it is appropriate to state reliability and flexibility as supply chain capabilities to achieve the other six supply chain competencies. Furthermore, the entire literature in this domain can be classified into four genres according to the addressed objectives, namely, concept development/validation, capability assessment, network design and performance evaluation. Research limitations/implications: The information revealed from the keyword co-occurrence analysis along with the research implications provided in the penultimate section will assist budding researchers in framing novel and promising research objectives. Supply chain administrators and policymakers can utilize the literature classification and the notable references provided in this review for locating potential methods for assessing supply chain strategic capabilities, designing the supply chain and evaluating the performance of the supply chain. Originality/value: An integrated bibliometric and descriptive literature review procedure is utilized in this paper. Furthermore, this critical review is the first work on comprehensively mapping the research relationships among various strategic capabilities required for mitigating supply chain risks. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073964580&doi=10.1108%2fJAMR-04-2019-0061&partnerID=40&md5=f317484c1a8a74b00c7243d679a4f0ff,Scopus

In the adverse environmental effect of industries worldwide, green supply chain management (GSCM) has appealed to companies to reduce the occurrence of such issues. This study evaluated the current SC design and operations of small garment manufacturing companies with respect to their environmental practices. Using the green supply chain operations reference (G-SCOR) model, data from the subject companies were evaluated based on fifteen (15) indicators of the six (6) attributes which include reliability, responsiveness, agility, cost, asset management efficiency, and green practices. Results revealed that the small garment companies have excellent performance in terms of perfect order fulfillment (POF) and working capital turnover (WCT) while good performances were observed in total SC management cost (TSCM), cost of goods sold (COGS), awareness management, and waste management. In contrast, poor performances were evident in upside supply chain adaptability (USCA), downside supply chain adaptability (DSCA), fixed asset turnover (FAT) ratio, implementation of green procurement, recycled materials, and carbon dioxide (CO2) gas emission. A multiple regression analysis model was also created to determine the significant factors contributing to GSCM. Results revealed that among the indicators, CO2 emission, waste management, and COGS significantly influence the GSCM. To improve the companies’ G-SCOR performance, it is recommended that appropriate environmental practices such as green procurement, recycling, waste management, and reverse logistics should be implemented. Proper information dissemination campaigns should also be done in the companies so that the employees may be educated and be involved in the GSCM practices. © IEOM Society International.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114245887&partnerID=40&md5=c8bee95e8ae70a956caae445e41fbb9f,Scopus

In order to maintain low cost and stability in the operation of dynamic SC system, a cost optimization strategy (COS) and a robust control strategy (RCS) are investigated. A cost model of LT reduction is set up through the method of piecewise accumulation, and then a COS is designed by the comparison between the LT reduction cost and the shortage cost. By considering production LTs and uncertainties of the external demand and internal parameter for dynamic SC system, an inventory state transition equation and a system cost transition equation are developed. Based on the fuzzy control theory, a RCS is designed to reduce the interference of uncertainties and LTs to the normal operation of the dynamic SC system.

From the perspective of strengthening supply chain resilience, a new architecture of supply chain which incorporates blockchain mechanisms is proposed. This allows supply chains to strengthen their own resilience without weakening the existing efficiency, so as to fully utilize today's digital technology and achieve rapid innovation and strong integration when faced with crises and challenges in new situations. A particular focus is on extending the application of the blockchain technology to the entire digital business ecosystem. Two Japanese industry examples are used to demonstrate how the new architectural model of supply chain with blockchain mechanism can minimize the losses caused by the stagnation of the supply chain. From these examples, the benefits and risks of the blockchain technology based management to individual enterprises, supply chain and whole digital business ecosystem are identified. © Sabine Baumann 2022.

A detail evaluation of the investment in using this technology and its anticipated returns are demonstrated. IIoT is believed to be an emerging solution for oil and gas complexities. The main drivers behind this technology are data storage, data analytics, reliability improvement and materiality assessment and control. The application of IIoT in areas of artificial lift optimization, Supply chain in real time, cyclic steam stimulation and flow assurance is described. This technology provides real time solution for dynacards interpretation and analysis for Sucker rod pumps, operating point analysis for Electrical submersible pumps and predicted cumulative production for all artificial lift optimization; efficient planning and waste elimination for supply chain and logistics; real time steam quality and quantity check for CSS and a complete digital approach to reservoir management and flow assurance.

A more challenging factor is the rapid variation in the demand of the products across gas supply chain. These challenges require high operational flexibility across the supply chain to adapt its product portfolio to the market-changes. To this end, optimization of the entire supply chain is highly essential to address these pressing challenges. This paper details an optimization analysis of a countrywide gas supply chain typical to the Middle East region. A unified optimization model that encompasses all the supply chain components is formulated. The model, in its most general form, comprises of 446 decision variables and 190 constraints, which is solved using an evolutionary algorithm. The key application of the proposed model is that it can be used in assessing the optimum allocation of the gas across the various layers of supply chain to maximize countrywide total profit. The model shows that an increase of 3% in profit can be achieved.

With the moderating effect of regulatory pressure, relational behaviors more effectively facilitate operational coordination through trust. Alternately, regulatory pressure attenuates the mediated relationship through calculative commitment. Research limitations/implications: The research introduces constrained choice dynamics into the supply chain relationship literature via MRT. Integrating generative mechanisms from relational exchange and institutional theories provides theoretical depth and context-specific knowledge about relationships that operate in constrained choice situations. Practical implications: Managers impacted by constrained choice should recognize that mechanisms typically resulting in positive relationship outcomes may respond differently in the presence of regulatory constraints. With greater regulatory pressure, efforts to enhance operational coordination are more effective using relational mechanisms to build trust. When trust is diminished, calculative commitment can be effective in achieving operational coordination, although extensive regulations make it more difficult. Originality/value: Previous research traditionally assumes that managers are free to select suitable trading partners that ensure mutually beneficial relationships. The research develops a middle-range theory examining the constrained choice dynamic in relationships that are impacted to varying degrees by regulatory institutions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071686650&doi=10.1108%2fIJLM-01-2019-0030&partnerID=40&md5=200dea5939fd0a02ca54dfb9ad5bf64c,Scopus

Following large-scale and catastrophic disasters, local organisations integrate with other responding organisations to form hastily disaster relief supply chain networks. Such supply networks are infrequently activated in a single location, generate unparalleled uncertainty, change quickly, and are driven by the urgency of saving lives and restoring livelihoods. Unfortunately, even where sound supply chain management practices are used, supply networks have encountered diverse levels of resilience and adequate disaster relief performance has remained elusive. In this paper, several unique characteristics that disaster relief efforts exhibit are examined as compared with demand-driven, steady-state supply chains. Important differences in the flows of resource, money, and information are identified. A complex adaptive supply network (CASN) lens is used to frame what existing literature has uncovered regarding disaster relief efforts, showing how relief organisations, their interactions, and their environmental context help determine the level of resilience that supply networks experience following disasters. This CASN characterisation is leveraged to help explain why traditional supply chain management practices lead to varied results in disaster relief. Finally, complexity science theory is drawn on to set forth eight testable propositions that may help to enhance supply network resilience. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902546073&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2013.787496&partnerID=40&md5=631e5c91e863f32d6345a53052dd49d4,Scopus

An SC has a one-manufacturer-one-retailer structure and competes against a symmetric SC. In each SC, the manufacturer decides both the production volume and the advertising efforts, while the retailer controls both the purchasing volume and the selling price. Firms within each SC can manage their business by adopting either a wholesale price contract (WPC) or a revenue-sharing contract (RSC). In general, an SC can achieve coordination when shifting from a WPC to an RSC. Nevertheless, this is no longer true when SC competition exists. We show that an RSC is beneficial only when the rival SC uses a WPC. In fact, when both SCs adopt an RSC, the general advantages gained through coordination vanish and both SCs are operationally and economically worse off. © 2021 The Authors.

Both firms have economic motivations to perform the return rate because customers who return end-of-use goods also repurchase new ones. In addition, the manufacturer exploits the returns’ residual value in operations to increase profits. Because the manufacturer has both operational and marketing motivations to close the loop, he can provide an incentive to the retailer to boost her investments in green activity programs. The incentive can be either state dependent or control dependent. The former assumes that the incentive depends on the fraction of customers who are willing to return end-of-use products; the latter is proportional to the retailer’s green activity programs efforts. Our results show that a state-dependent incentive is profit-Pareto-improving only when the retailer’s environmental effectiveness is large. In contrast, a control-dependent incentive mechanism is profit-Pareto-improving for low incentive values, high retailer’s environmental effectiveness, and customers’ repurchasing intention. In all other cases, players have divergent preferences and neither mechanism coordinates the CLSC. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957580502&doi=10.1007%2fs13235-015-0142-6&partnerID=40&md5=34f74c07bea1bfb23b818812ded887bd,Scopus

Similarly, sector emissions are factored by travel distance, vehicle fuel intensity and fuel GHG (""carbon"") intensity. Analyzing these factors using US and China data reveals that for a broad range of conditions, stringent GHG emissions limits for the auto sector imply limits of comparable stringency for fuel carbon intensity. However, carbon intensity is a modeled representation of complex energy supply and use systems rather than a measurable property of fuels themselves. Carefully examining the locations and magnitudes of fuel-related emissions indicates that the proper policy focus is on the sectors that supply fuel rather than the choice of fuels in the auto sector. Therefore, beyond fundamental R&D, policies to commercialize AFVs are not necessarily required for climate protection at present. In addition to managing travel demand and improving vehicle efficiency, the implied policy priority is limiting net GHG impacts in the energy and other natural resource sectors that supply fuels.

Based on the definition of an appropriate web-based application, the infrastructure is able to connect the possible client requests and the relative supply chain prod-uct/process development capabilities and then attempt to find the best available solutions. In par-ticular, the main goal of the developed system, called AMSA (Additive Manufacturing Spare parts market Application), is the definition of a common platform to supply different kinds of services that have the following common reference points in the Additive Manufacturing Technologies (DFAM, Design For Additive Manufacturing): product development, prototypes, or small series production and reverse engineering activities to obtain Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models starting from a physical object. The definition of different kinds of services allows satisfying several client needs such as innovative product definition characterized by high performance in terms of stiffness/weight ratio, the possibility of manufacturing small series, such as in the motorsport field, and the possibility of defining CAD models for the obsolete parts for which the geometrical information is missed. The AMSA platform relies on the reconfigurable supply chain that is dynamic, and it depends on the client needs. For example, when the client requires the manufacture of a small series of a component, AMSA allows the technicians to choose the best solutions in terms of delivery time, price, and logistics. Therefore, the suppliers that contribute to the definition of the dynamic supply chain have an important role. For these reasons, the AMSA platform represents an important and innovative tool that is able to link the suppliers to the customers in the best manner in order to obtain services that are characterized by a high-performance level. Therefore, a provisional model has been implemented that allows filtering the technologies according to suitable performance in-dexes. A specific aspect for which AMSA can be considered unique is related with the given possibility to access Design for Additive Manufacturing Services through the Web in accordance with the possible additive manufacturing technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

The highest performance benefits can only be achieved if both suppliers and customers are involved in this process.

AM techanology has capabilities to revolutionize manufacturing industry due to its huge advantages over traditional manufacturing (customized design, complex free and flexibility). AM technology provides small quantities of customized, personalized and geometrically complex products relatively at low cost as compared to traditional manufacturing. AM technology also provides customized shape, digital interaction with customers, direct manufacturing that give benefits in terms of lower cost, reduced supply chain complexity and lead times, etc. AM technology has been already adopted in fields of dental, biomedical, fashion and apparel due to its hyper flexibilities in supply chain. This review explores future scope, opportunities and challenges associated with supply chain management in adoption of AM technologies and also highlights the research gap by researchers from research background. AM technology is developing since 1980s and undergone huge transformation, but the integration of AM in supply chain is not explored so much. Therefore, this topic has good research scope. Systematic literature review has been done to find impacts (challenges, risks opportunities, advantages, etc.) of AM technologies on supply chain as well as future scope of AM in SCM. This review paper can serve as basis for future research related to this topic and add value to existing literature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101217567&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-15-8542-5_39&partnerID=40&md5=85592d77bf2dd6e4f041c64c50097563,Scopus

Two types of agents are employed, namely, physical agents to represent supply entities and auxiliary agents to deal with supply network configuration decisions. While using the evolutionary algorithm, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II to optimize both cost and lead time at the supply network level, agents are modelled with an architecture which consists of decision-making, learning and communication modules. The physical agents make decisions considering varying situations to suit specific product-market profiles thereby generating alternative supply network configurations. These supply network configurations are then evaluated against a set of performance metrics, including the energy consumption of the supply chain processes concerned and the transportation distances between supply entities. Simulation results generated through the application of this approach to a refrigerator production network show that the selected supply network configurations are capable of meeting intended sustainable goals while catering to the respective product-market profiles. © 2018 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062838131&doi=10.1109%2fPOMS.2018.8629448&partnerID=40&md5=a222114cdfe45cdaf4c938259ad3f206,Scopus

Currently, the time aspect has been considered a lot in LRP to bring better service levels for a company as it shows how responsive a supply chain is. In completing service level objective, time windows have been used to measure whether the delivery is successful in the planned time or not. Moreover, LRP research has been advised to take on a multiple-objective approach, which are not available much. Therefore developing and testing a model with multiple objectives such as cost and service level is at most important. The model for this specific problem is designed and tested using exact goal programming method for small-case instance, i.e. 4 distribution centers and 8 retailers.

Facing shortage of capital, the supplier may use two financing sources to facilitate her production: bank loan from a commercial bank, or advance payment from the manufacturer. Taking the supply chain with centralized control as a benchmark, we analyze the optimal decisions of the two members in the supply chain. We find that in the optimal decisions, the supplier chooses only one, instead of a combination, of the two financing sources, and the manufacturer is always willing to pay in advance to finance the supplier's production. Furthermore, we propose to use the pay back contract (as well as cost-sharing contract as an extension) for the manufacturer to share the production risk and stimulate the supplier to improve the production yield. Finally, assuming the bargaining process of the supplier and the manufacturer being a Nash bargaining game, we show that the pay back contract under the two sources of financing (bank loan and advance payment) can coordinate the supply chain and flexibly allocate the total profit in the supply chain. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086500277&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2020.107813&partnerID=40&md5=917fdba1b6b1dbefdcf27642151cb500,Scopus

However, effective processing of information from customers and suppliers remains a struggle for most firms. Absorptive capacity provides a useful view of information processing activities, but the current understanding of how firms use it to improve performance and why some firms seem to develop it while others do not remains unclear. This study is grounded in information processing theory, and examines the role of absorptive capacity in linking a firm's responsive strategy and performance. We test a structural equation model on data from 711 manufacturing firms, and validate our results on a second sample of 677 firms. Our study makes three major contributions by providing evidence that: (1) absorptive capacity is motivated by a firm's responsive strategy; (2) it fully mediates the relationship between responsive strategy and firm performance, indicating that absorptive capacity is a necessary competence for firms that aim to deliver innovative products to customers; and (3) the relationship between responsive strategy and absorptive capacity is U-shaped, indicating that when firms attempt to blend efficient and responsive strategies, their ability to develop absorptive capacity is diminished. © 2015 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84942568268&doi=10.1111%2fjscm.12085&partnerID=40&md5=38dfb8020832500501c70e7decf3a4f0,Scopus

However most of the studies assume a linear supply chain with a single reverse flow of returns, which is a simplification that may not hold in most of the existent supply chains, which often show more complex structures with several flows of returns. When there are several return flows, a critical decision for the supply chain dynamic performance is whether the remanufacturing process should be centralised (i.e. a single facility jointly remanufactures the returns from all the locations) or decentralised (i.e. the remanufacturing takes place independently in each location). This paper explores the impact of this critical decision on the performance of a divergent closed-loop supply chain with several point-of-sales and reverse flows. A simulation model is developed considering different return rates, information transparency levels, and number of nodes in the supply chain. Findings reveal that a centralized configuration reduces the uncertainty in the reverse flows of remanufactured products, smoothing the production orders of the involved organizations and improving their inventory performance. As a drawback, upstream members of the supply chain may face a higher uncertainty due to some correlation of orders. As such, this configuration may not be recommended in long supply chains with a significant number of return flows and high average return volumes, unless there is a high transparency of information. Furthermore, guidelines for managers are provided in order to reduce the bullwhip effect when implementing these circular economy practices. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086029570&doi=10.1016%2fj.omega.2020.102268&partnerID=40&md5=7038ddbe9beddb34e4f8e39e609ab422,Scopus

Despite strenuous efforts by public policy-makers to alter the freight modal split, most companies still rely heavily on road transportation, and modal shifts to rail and water have remained modest at best. In this paper we argue that this is partly the result of a failure to take a holistic supply chain view of the modal shift process. Synchromodality provides a framework within which shippers can manage their supply chains more flexibly to increase the potential for shifting mode. On the basis of a literature review, we broaden the conventional focus of multimodal transportation to give it a supply chain dimension, and propose the concept of ‘Synchromodality from a Supply Chain Perspective’ (SSCP). Using a case study we show that when the supply chain impacts are taken into account, it is possible to significantly increase the share of intermodal rail transportation within a corridor, without necessarily increasing total logistics cost or reducing the service level. In this way the environmental impact of freight activities can be significantly reduced. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020438584&doi=10.1016%2fj.trd.2017.05.011&partnerID=40&md5=f90a8cba635efe089a513b750a8b6991,Scopus

It is clear that company supply chain could be optimized for insuring customer satisfaction. Due to low cost of labor force in emerging countries, companies in developed countries have to reorganizing themselves for being competitive. Industry 4.0 and supply chain 4.0 are the results of this crucial desire of better performance. A company has to integrate new technological concepts and digitalization on its supply chain in order to reduce cost and increase product quality. Despite the great and positive impact on large companies, these concepts are not already integrated into small and medium enterprises (SMEs). They considered industry 4.0 and supply chain 4.0 concepts as a dream, thus they are not ready to use them for increasing their performance. The use of complex system modelling and multi-criteria analysis allow to define an adapted framework specially destined to SMEs improvement according to supply 4.0 concepts.

Sustainability is considered as important for supply chain performance.

A change in production can have a stronger impact on supply chains than a change in goods circulation. In particular, innovations inspired by sustainable development concerns which are firstly introduced within the production system, as some authors point out [Blanquart et al. (2008)], may greatly influence logistical organizations. Their introduction within supply chains requires more time [Roussat and Fabbe-Costes (2014)]. Change drivers may be institutional, commercial, technical, or managerial. Their types and features vary across periods and industries. Some may have quick-impact consequences, others will be slow in showing their effects on the whole supply chain. Three types of change drivers are currently main issues when consumer goods are concerned. Measures for preserving natural resources, with waste management and recycling of end-of-life products in order to minimize the consumption of non renewable resources, make up the first type of drivers. The second type is the ever wider use of online purchases, which disturbs B to B and B to C relationships as well as urban logistics and the last mile delivery terms. Thirdly, changes in logistical organizations of mass retailers may direct traffic flows via new logistics hubs. Food products are concerned by these change drivers in a specific way. Although some of them such as schools of fish may be renewable, natural resources must be protected. Reverse logistics processes are mainly confined to packaging because of the very nature of food. Distance purchases are steadily rising. While the market dependency upon mass retail firms is high, short supply circuits relying on local producers also attract consumers. Within the agri-food sector, the industry of fishery and aquaculture products is a major one feeding billion people around the world. In Europe, it employs approximately 267 000 full time equivalent workers [European Union (2014)], provides activity for hundreds of seaports, and positively contributes to local economies in peripheral shore areas. The paper therefore focuses on the situation of fishery and aquaculture products. The analysis highlights the situation of the whole supply chain within this specific food industry, allowing to achieve a non-fragmented view of it. It also clarifies, from a qualitative viewpoint, the respective role of sustainable development-based change drivers and the others, allowing to point out those giving impetus to changes. The analysis relies on a survey of academic literature and specialized publications, and on interviews with experts and key market players. It highlights the specific adaptations of supply chains within this valuable industry fully integrated in a global business world. It points out the first impacts of sustainable development concern decisions compared with those of other change drivers and illustrates how both kinds of impact interact to shape supply chain schemes. © 2016 The Authors.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991658433&doi=10.1016%2fj.trpro.2016.05.349&partnerID=40&md5=4773cb537109887d97df49417e211d2a,Scopus

There are two choices for the whole supply chain to deal with uncertain risks: information sharing (IS) or no information sharing (NS). Under strategy IS, the information about market demand and the retailer's inventory can be shared within the supply chain. For each strategy, the effects of yield, demand, and lead time uncertainties on costs of the supply chain and channel members are studied. It is found that (i) it is rewarding for the upstream manufacturer to use a retailer's shared information under uncertain yield or demand; (ii) however, information sharing (IS) strategy sometimes should be abandoned for other members and the whole supply chain; (iii) counterintuitively, the increase of transportation time uncertainty benefits the retailer. © 2019 Heng Du and Ye Jiang.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067785402&doi=10.1155%2f2019%2f4695654&partnerID=40&md5=ada327ef54e73ac79751e5f553f35f4a,Scopus

Utilizing the method of multi-agent modeling, a manufacturer and a supplier are modeled as the intelligent agents with the reinforcement learning behavior. The study shows that: 1) when the number of instant consumers is small, reliability improvement strategy should be selected; otherwise, the manufacturer should adopt a backup strategy; 2) only when mean yield is large enough, reliability improvement strategy is the optimal choice; and 3) if yield uncertainty is small, the manufacturer should choose reliability improvement strategy; otherwise, it is suitable to use a backup strategy. In addition, when the main supplier can determine its own wholesale price, it is found that: 1) when the mean yield is small, a lower wholesale price should be designed for the main supplier, to induce higher order quantity under backup strategy; and 2) the impact of yield uncertainty on the manufacturer's supply management strategy can be changed by the main supplier's adaptive pricing behavior. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065076222&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2911620&partnerID=40&md5=53b46d8dc9651beb5f2f5405194fcbc6,Scopus

Additionally, it facilitates extensive, real-time monitoring by sensors and process analytical technology (PAT) tools without perturbing the process. In the presented case study, the use of multivariate tools for the real-time monitoring and retrospective review of a continuous active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) synthesis was evaluated from process development through to commercialization. Method: A multivariate statistical process monitoring (MSPM) approach summarizing variability in both quality critical (controlled flow rates, temperatures) and non-quality critical parameters (pressures, pump speeds, conductivity) was used to monitor three telescoped chemistry stages of a continuous API synthesis. Four different modeling strategies were presented addressing specific monitoring and analysis requirements during the pharmaceutical development lifecycle. Results: During development (R&D and commercial facility), the implemented multivariate monitoring resulted in the identification of potential failure modes, a deeper understanding of the natural process variability and accelerated root cause analysis for a recurrent reagent blockage. During manufacturing (commercial facility), the multivariate tool confirmed potential for predictive maintenance and early fault detection. Conclusions: While the implemented control strategy based on parametric control and offline analytical testing provided the required quality assurance, the multivariate trends provided additional information on process performance. More specifically, they enabled more detailed process understanding during the development of the continuous API synthesis following quality by design (QbD) principles and demonstrated the potential for enhanced process performance during commercial manufacturing. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055925355&doi=10.1007%2fs12247-018-9348-7&partnerID=40&md5=67208c7626204dbd27961ac88b4cf336,Scopus

Simplification strategies, such as horizontal mergers, and networking strategies, such as risk pooling, are conflicting paradigms that have been shown to improve financial performance of supply partners. The implication of this to disruption risk is not fully known, especially as it concerns information security breach (ISB). Analysts have rated ISB as a huge disruption risk, costing businesses millions of dollars. Using a credible and well-established agent-based simulation approach and statistical analysis, we examine the impact of ISB on the simplification and risk pooling strategies respectively under three different order replenishment systems. The effect of reconfiguring the supply chain is first examined in a non-security breach scenario and then in a breached scenario. We find that reconfiguration has no benefit to a supply chain using a parameter based replenishment policy (option I), in both breach and non-breach situations, but leads to significant advantage when batch ordering model (option II) or a combined batch-and-parameter based ordering policy (option III) is used. We also established that batch ordering system favours the risk pooling strategy whereas a combined batch-and-parameter ordering system favours the simplification counterpart especially when the simplification is at the wholesaler tier. This study has significant implications for supply chain design as well as information security priorities. This is one of the first papers to look at how ISB impacts supply chain configuration and the role of ordering decision context. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092766871&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2020.107939&partnerID=40&md5=5718f29310197ab6e12ab897f0774327,Scopus

Therefore, higher resilience was essential to withstand higher Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (SCV) through enhanced capabilities, for which identifying dynamic SCV becomes critical. To address this, the study employed the Topic Over Time modelling approach to detect critical SCV using 1,748 unstructured official documents on the HZMB from 2003 to 2018 (project design to handover). The popularity trend analysis that was thereby conducted, enabled identifying the six most critical vulnerabilities and categorizing them among each project phase. Finally, an ex-post vulnerability evaluation map was developed by considering the vulnerabilities' popularity trend and their relevance towards the project and SC phases. Using these findings, industry practitioners could improve their ex-ante decision-making, targeting value-enhanced-resilient SCs in future prefabricated infrastructure development projects. Further, the text-mining research approach unveils an effective mechanism for researchers to extract dynamic empirical clues from a large unstructured set of documents in construction SCs. © 2021 Proceedings of the 37th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2021.

The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) was a milestone prefabricated construction project which was successfully constructed using these industrial advancements. However, the project itself was a great challenge as it was highly vulnerable to disruptions due to complex supply chain processes. In this regard, increased resilience could be the key to boosting project performance through enhanced Supply Chain Capabilities (SCCs), where identifying SCC dynamics becomes essential. Therefore, this study employed the Topic Over Time Modeling approach to detect critical SCCs using 1,748 unstructured official documents on the HZMB from 2003 to 2018, which spans the period from project design to handover. The popularity trend analysis of texts enabled identifying the six most critical capabilities associated with each construction phase of planning, construction and handover. Thereafter, an ex-post capability evaluation map was developed by considering the popularity trend of capabilities and their relevance to different project phases. Industry practitioners would benefit from prior knowledge of SCCs and their dynamic impact on each project phase to prioritize initiating them adequately and appropriately, targeting value-enhanced-resilient supply chains in ex-ante decision-making of future prefabricated infrastructure development projects.

This is explained by the supply chain nature of trade integration: final demand in Germany is not necessarily the main determinant of CE4 exports to Germany. Second, increased trade openness in both Germany and the CE4 implies a greater exposure of the GCESC to global shocks.

Design/methodology/approach: Using Archer’s morphogenetic theory as an analytical lens, this paper presents case analyses adduced from primary and secondary data related to the development of relational anti-slavery supply capabilities in Brazilian–UK beef and timber supply chains. Findings: Four distinct types of adaptation were found among first-tier suppliers: horizontal systemisation, vertical systemisation, horizontal transformation and vertical differentiation. Research limitations/implications: This study draws attention to the socially situated nature of corporate action, moving beyond the rationalistic discourse that underpins existing research studies of multi-tier, socially sustainable, supply chain management. Cross-sector comparison highlights sub-country and intra-sectoral differences in both institutional setting and the approaches and outcomes of individual corporate actors’ initiatives. Sustainable supply chain management theorists would do well to seek out those institutional entrepreneurs who actively reshape the institutional conditions within which they find themselves situated.

Further analyses are conducted to establish whether Industry 4.0 digital technologies moderate the association between (a) supply chain integration and supply chain agility and (b) supply chain agility and financial performance. Findings based on the data pertaining to a sample of 274 Swedish manufacturing firms indicate that supply chain agility fully mediates the link between supply chain integration and financial performance. However, while Industry 4.0 digital technologies strengthen the effect of supply chain agility on financial performance, they do not moderate the relationship between supply chain integration and supply chain agility.

In order to cope with unexpected events like natural or man-made disasters, flexible international long-distance transportation modes and postponement strategies are taken into account in our supply chain model. In order to balance supply chain costs and the flexibility of supply chains, a two-stage multi-scenario stochastic programming model is developed where the stochastic events are represented by corresponding scenarios.

The motivation of our paper is to investigate the idea of enabling a global flexible SC with disruptive risks in making it less vulnerable by applying diverse transportation modes which is also our first contribution. The flexibility stems from the fact that transportation modes with a low-speed transportation contain latent time buffers that can be used by accelerating transport activities. This represents a promising approach to make supply chains (SCs) more flexible and to establish an additional degree of freedom in order to manage stochastic events like minor disruptions or serious catastrophes. In this paper, a stochastic programming model for a multi-stage multi-product SC is developed. SC partners, including multiple suppliers, a processing center, two assembling centers, multiple distribution centers and retailers, are incorporated into the model. The second contribution of this paper is that different types of possible future catastrophic disruptions are quantified and included in the model. SC catastrophic disruptions like transportation delays or the fact that a SC node is disrupted by a serious catastrophe are stochastic factors of our model. The model is solved by using PySP, a specific modeling and stochastic programming framework. In order to show the quality of solutions of the stochastic programming model (SP solutions), a large amount of scenarios is generated to simulate the real case for each instance. The expected SC costs for these scenarios will be evaluated based on SP solutions and wait-and-see solutions, which are benchmarks. In addition, decision makers with neutral, optimistic and pessimistic attitudes regarding the occurrence of disruptions are also simulated and evaluated in the computational experiments. Managerial insights are concluded from computational results. The most important conclusion is that proper transportation mode planning enables a flexible global supply chain. Further conclusions like the quality of stochastic solutions and solutions of simulating decision makers with neutral, optimistic and pessimistic attitudes, as well as the most beneficial transportation modes in SCs with uncertain environments are proposed based on the computational results. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006761436&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2016.08.020&partnerID=40&md5=0406548a5cbeffcc32d64cc13c05c37d,Scopus

(2012) identifies as many as fourteen sources of supply chain uncertainty. Christopher and Lee (2004) find it difficult for supply chains to be efficient if they are highly exposed to risk and uncertainty. The authors further argue that risks reduce the confidence of managers in supply chains and hence increase the expected loss of performance. Supply chain flexibility is the ability of the partners in the chain to respond to disruptions efficiently with minimum loss of performance. The majority of academic work on manufacturing and supply chain flexibility describes flexibility as a response to, or a means to cope with, uncertainty (Upton, 1995; Bertrand, 2003; Sheffiand Rice, 2005). Literature also establishes a positive linkage between flexibility and performance. The present paper, a portion of a larger study conducted by the author, investigates the role of supply chain flexibility in reducing the impact of uncertainties on performance in the automotive supply chains in India. Automotive supply chains are among the most complicated chains to manage because of the involvement of enormous number of suppliers and the associated uncertainties. In the recent past, automotive industry in India and in other parts of the world has experienced loss in performance due to disruptions from within and outside the chains. The Indian auto industry has a share of around 5-6 per cent in the country's GDP, which is further expected to go up to 10 per cent in the year 2016 (AMA, 2006). Manufacturers of auto components operating at tier 1 and tier 2 levels of various supply chains in the industry are considered as the primary unit of analysis. A structured questionnaire was administered to manufacturers of auto components using convenience sampling method. The relationship between flexibility and performance in the presence of uncertainty has been examined using correlation and regression methods. The study confirms the negative impact of uncertainty on performance and also that flexibility and uncertainty co-varies but in different directions. This implies that flexibility reduces the impact of uncertainty. However, performance is found to be positively linked with flexibility. © IEOM Society International. © IEOM Society International.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018430297&partnerID=40&md5=fa623655369895607788528985e4f61c,Scopus

To incorporate the existing stochasticity in our dynamic problem, we develop a multi-stage stochastic program to specify the optimal location, capacity, inventory, and allocation decisions. Further, a data-driven rolling horizon approach is developed to use observations of the random parameters in the stochastic optimization problem. In contrast to traditional stochastic programming approaches that are valid only for a limited number of scenarios, the rolling horizon approach makes the determined decisions by the stochastic program implementable in practice and evaluates them. The stochastic program is presented as a quadratic conic optimization, and to generate an efficient scenario tree, a forward scenario tree construction technique is employed. An extensive numerical study is carried out to investigate the applicability of the presented model and rolling horizon procedure, the efficiency of risk-measurement policies, and the performance of the scenario tree construction technique.

Design/methodology/approach: A survey research design is adopted to collect primary and secondary data from 182 international firms. The complementarity (or substitutability) of three As (agile, adaptable and aligned) were analyzed in three-way and pairwise interactions; both, correlation and performance differences methods of testing the type of interactions among the system’s elements were used. Supply chain-centric and firm-centric performance metrics were used to examine the interaction types. Findings: The study did not find empirical evidence of three-way complementarity between the three As. However, this paper did find evidence of complementarity in bivariate interactions for alignment and adaptability. Moreover, in the performance difference method, the study found a substitute relationship between all pairs of As. Practical implications: The findings related to the substitutability between the three As offer managers guidance on how to allocate their limited resources to avoid unnecessary over-or under-investing in either one of the three As. Originality/value: This study helps refine prior findings related to the three As by offering evidence that firms can still achieve their performance-related goals with reduced investment commitments by taking advantage of the substitutability relationship existent between these capabilities. That is, instead of concomitantly developing all three As as past studies have suggested, managers can use the findings to determine how to prioritize their resource allocation better. Furthermore, understanding the actual interaction among the supply chain variables generally provide insights for designing the supply chain, change management in the supply chain, developing supply chain strategy and adopting best practices in the supply chain. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102170215&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-08-2020-0424&partnerID=40&md5=992f0858aeaf822ec2e043dee7e92205,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: Four hypothesized relationships are tested with survey data from 190 high-tech firms using structural equation models. Findings: FSCA can be enhanced through the transactive memory system and SNF, although a higher degree of transactive memory system weakens the positive relationship between SNF and FSCA. A positive relationship is identified between FSCA and OP, while FSCA mediates the relationship between SNF and OP. Practical implications: Managers can increase FSCA and improve OP by developing both the transactive memory system and SNF.

Foodservices can partner with farmers for food waste collection and its subsequent use as fertilizer or animal feedstock. Anecdotal evidence of industrial symbiosis adopted by foodservices and farmers exists, but no empirical research has been undertaken to understand the determinants of broader industry adoption of industrial symbiosis and how these determinants could be reinforced. This study explores the potential of industrial symbiosis to minimize food waste in commercial foodservices in Russia. By interviewing foodservice providers and farmers, the study demonstrates willingness of selected stakeholders to uptake industrial symbiosis as a means of food waste recovery, but also as an opportunity to reinforce social and network capital of foodservice operators and farmers. To encourage broader industry uptake, policy-makers should build inter-sectoral capacity by connecting foodservices and farmers.

Increased customer expectations regarding product variety, shortened product life-cycles and volatile demand motivate the need for supply chain flexibility (SCF) in the face of stiff competition and environmental changes. Flexibility processes implementation in supply chains varies according to companies and SC, due to several factors. The level of awareness of the need for flexibility, the proactive or reactive plan and use of flexibility; and the focus on the SC as a whole or in single companies are examples. The concept of process maturity assumes that the implementation of procedures is carried out in multiple evolutionary and successive stages, which are explicitly defined, managed and measured. Maturity models give companies indicators as well as guidance to analyze and subsequently improve their processes. Despite several SC maturity models in the literature, there is not a model focusing on the maturity of SC flexibility processes, like the one intended in this paper. The levels of the maturity of SCF are (1) none, (2) inter-firm, (3) SC reactive, (4) SC proactive, and (5) SC paradigmatic.

Demand for a wider product choice, shortened product lifecycle and expected high availability add to the already complex, dynamic and uncertain business environment. Operating under such conditions poses difficulties to a company to uphold their supply chain's performance. Flexibility is required to be able to adapt to unanticipated changes in supply or demand and to diminish their repercussions. Miscellaneous flexibility measures, e.g. safety stocks or flexible capacities, are widespread used to compensate demand fluctuations. The selected measures' parameters, e.g. range of flexible capacity, must be configured ahead of the implementation in practice. The flexibility parameters determine the scope of action a flexibility measure enables.

However, firms have put only limited energies into factory floor decisions and capacity planning and almost none into generating a tighter coupling between the factory and central planning. The bulk of the work to make ""smarter factory decisions"" has focused on two simple metrics: increasing output and reducing cycle time-often without accommodating the need to run lots at different velocities and without recognizing how the operating curve (trade-off between lead time and tool utilization-Appendix 3) links them. In fact, many of the recent Lean initiatives have focused on eliminating variability to induce simplicity to achieve improved output or cycle time without concern for the impact on responsiveness or capacity. The purpose of this paper is to (a) make clear the critical, and often overlooked, role of factory responsiveness with respect to central planning; (b) explain how traditional factory planning and the current application of Lean can severely impact the firm's responsiveness; (c) elaborate on touch points between central and factory planning demonstrating simple tactical methods that can improve responsiveness and protect the factory from churn; (d) explain why smarter dispatch scheduling is critical to successful responsiveness; and (e) outline the basics of smarter dispatch scheduling.

In this paper, a centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy is applied to control inventories in a 4 echelons supply chain. The single MPC controller used in this strategy optimizes globally and finds an optimal ordering policy for each node. The controller relies on a linear discrete-time state-space model to predict process output and the prediction can be approached by two multi-step predictors, which depend on measurability of the controller states. The objective function takes a quadratic form and thus the resulting optimization problem can be solved via standard quadratic programming.

This study focuses on the development of an QM tool, based on the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) approach, and demonstrates how it can be extended from application in supply chain management (SCM) to other business environments. The main contributions are to implement an iterative process using FMEA for DSCs in a flexible-based environment by overcoming the weaknesses associated with traditional FMEA system and to develop a user-friendly interface, with which the distributed parties in chains could cooperate as a whole and meet the needs of dynamic control. In specific, this paper proposes a computerintegrated FMEA approach that enhanced FMEA in SCM through automated processing using a fuzzy approach and a computer-integrated and internet-based interface to support the system implementation. The efficiency and practical implication of the proposed system has been validated by the developed system with a case study.

This paper considers a supply chain that consists of construction sites, landfills and commercial sources in which operators seek cooperation to maximize backfill reuse and improve waste recovery efficiency. Unlike the ordinary material supply chain in manufacturing industries, the supply chain for backfill involves many dynamic processes, which increases the complexity of analyzing and solving the logistic issue. Therefore, this study attempts to identify an appropriate methodology to analyze the dynamic supply chain, for facilitating the backfill reuse. A centralized optimization model and a distributed agent-based model are proposed and implemented in comparing their performances. The centralized optimization model can obtain a global optimum but requires sharing of complete information from all supply chain entities, resulting in barriers for implementation. In addition, whenever the backfill supply chain changes, the centralized optimization model needs to reconfigure the network structure and recompute the optimum. The distributed agent-based model focuses on task distribution and cooperation between business entities in the backfill supply chain. In the agent-based model, decision making and communication between construction sites, landfills, and commercial sources are emulated by a number of autonomous agents. They perform together through a negotiation algorithm for optimizing the supply chain configuration that reduces the backfill shipment cost. A comparative study indicates that the agent-based model is more capable of studying the dynamic backfill supply chain due to its decentralization of optimization and fast reaction to unexpected disturbances. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Two competitive environment variables are analysed: competitive intensity of the industry and complexity of the SC. Two opposing competitive strategies are also considered: cost and differentiation. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses have been tested using data gathered via a questionnaire given to 277 Spanish manufacturing companies, and structural equation modelling has been used for the analysis. Findings: The results show that competitive intensity is the most influential factor followed by business strategy. SC complexity does not seem to affect agility. Moreover, although the competitive environment variables affect the business strategy, the latter has no mediating effects between the competitive environment and SC agility, adaptability and alignment capabilities.

The old conventions no longer work in this new world of volatile and increasingly unpredictable demand and supply. The enterprise needs to become more 'connected' to its own parts, as well as its partners up and down the chains it participates in. So too, we need to embrace new ways of looking at customers to gain deeper, more insightful impressions of what they are telling us about the way they want to buy our products and services. Finally, these signals need converting into corresponding action, driven by the people in the business, leaders and staff alike, who are aligned to their customers' wishes. This is the world of dynamic supply chain alignment where, increasingly, supply chains are the business. In the follow-up to his hugely successful Strategic Supply Chain Alignment, John Gattorna's Dynamic Supply Chain Alignment, explores how to create and sustain multiple supply chains with a level of flexibility and responsiveness that allow you to respond to opportunities and threats; at the same time aligning with your suppliers, your partners and your customers. When more executives get to this stage of development the profits will flow more readily, and sustainability of performance will not be the same issue it is today. The way forward is right there in front of us; but, says John Gattorna, we must throw off old ways and embrace the new. © John Gattorna 2009.

The purpose of this paper is to provide guidance for effectively estimating the financial effects of mitigating commodity price risk volatility (CPV) in supply chain management decisions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts two prominent and complementary methodologies, namely, total cost of ownership (TCO and real options valuation (ROV), to illustrate how commodity price risk mitigation strategies can be analyzed with respect to their effect on costs and performance. The paper provides insights through a case study to demonstrate the application of these methods together and establish the benefits and challenges associated with their implementation. Findings: The paper illustrates advantages and disadvantages of TCO and ROV and how these approaches can be adopted together to contribute to effective purchasing decisions. Supply chain flexibility is a key capability but requires investments. Holistically measuring the financial effects of flexibility investments is imperative for gaining executive management support in mitigating commodity price volatility. Research limitations/implications: This study can provide supply chain professionals with useful guidance for measuring the costs and benefits related to developing strategies for mitigating commodity price volatility. TCO provides a focus on the costs associated with the commodity purchasing process, and ROV enables the aggregation of all the costs and benefits associated with the use of the strategy and synthesizes them into the net value estimate. Originality/value: The paper provides a comparison of different but complementary approaches, specifically TCO and ROV, for analyzing the effectiveness of CPV risk mitigation decisions. In addition, these two methods allow supply chain professionals to evaluate and control the financial effects of CPV risk, particularly the impact of mitigation on firm’s cash flows. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092483716&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-02-2020-0047&partnerID=40&md5=eccbbaf82ddd846e8e7da37bbcad9f05,Scopus

Based on the resource dependence theory, we developed 10 projections for 2025 on promising supply chain adaptations, which were assessed by 94 international supply chain experts from academia and industry. The results reveal that companies prioritize bridging over buffering approaches as long-term responses for increasing SCRES. Promising measures include increasing risk criteria importance in supplier selection, supply chain collaboration, and supply chain mapping. In contrast, experts ascribe less priority to safety stocks and coopetition.

However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values.

In the first part of the study, a strain of L. monocytogenes was maintained at two different fluctuating temperature regimes both from 2 to 8 C and regularly sampled for the quantitative determination. The first temperature regime lasted 204 hours with a fluctuation length of 12 hours whereas the second lasted 167 hours with a fluctuation length of 24 hours. A dynamic predictive model was implemented for the reproduction of the observed data. Model resolution has been carried out by using values of the recorded temperature as well as the value of the mean temperature, the kinetic mean temperature, the 75th and 95th percentile of the temperature. A stochastic resolution was also performed considering the mean temperature and Standard Deviation as stochastic variable. In the second part of the study, a temperature mean curve was constructed by monitoring temperature of 8 refrigerated conveyances, 10 display cabinet and 15 domestic refrigerators. This curve was used to obtain predictive scenarios for L. monocytogenes based on the above and also considering temperature regime suggested by the EURL Lm TECHNICAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENT on challenge tests and durability studies for assessing shelf-life of ready-to-eat foods related to Listeria monocytogenes (Version 4 of 1 July 2021). All predicted behaviours were compared to the observed ones through the Root Mean Squared Error. Firstly, dynamic predictive model as well as the stochastic one, provided the best level of reproducibility of the observed data. The kinetic mean temperature reproduced the observed data better than the mean temperature for the 12 hoursregime while for the 24 hours-regime was the opposite. The 75th and 95th percentile overestimated the observed growths. Secondary, predictions obtained with the mean temperature, kinetic temperature and stochastic approach well fitted the observed data. The 75th and 95th percentile of Temperature and the “Eurl LM” temperature regimes overestimated the observed prediction.

To properly anticipate the achievement of business objectives, in our in-depth case study of a Swiss wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical products we relied on the notion of weak signals as conceptualized by Ansoff to develop a conceptual framework of feedforward.

The literature on logistics capabilities was also examined to identify the various elements that contribute to supply chain agility. Findings: Supply chain agility has primarily been explored in the literature through a focus on manufacturing flexibility, supply chain speed, or lean manufacturing. The role of logistics capabilities in achieving supply chain agility has not been addressed from a holistic conceptual perspective. This research addresses that gap using a multi-disciplinary approach. As such, it is the first phase in theory building on the concept of supply chain agility.

The analysis reveals that previous research has primarily focused on humanitarian operations, with researchers adapting established supply chain methodologies to improve humanitarian disaster response. While this has benefited humanitarian organizations in their ability to respond to disasters with greater efficiency, it also clarifies that there has been little research done on humanitarian development, the overlooked part of humanitarian operations.

ITN distribution campaigns face several challenges, such as inadequate funding, budgetary constraints, hard-to-reach areas, limited transportation, and market and price volatility. While long-term agreements and proper planning can effectively overcome such challenges, those options may not be available for all humanitarian organizations and governments. To gain a better understanding of such tradeoffs we develop a robust optimization model that minimize ITN distribution costs while taking into consideration protection against financial, market and logistical uncertainties. The simultaneous account of such uncertainties is rarely seen on the humanitarian supply chain design literature. The proposed robust model explores data-driven adaptive uncertainty sets that capture the dependence structure among procurement and distribution costs, leading to plausible uncertain scenarios. In addition, we develop a hierarchical optimization approach to ease the burden of setting a specific robustness level for each constraint, when uncertainties are related to the independent terms. We study a United Nations Children’s Fund ITN distribution campaign in Ivory Coast, observing that (1) total costs increase with campaign robustness, as expected, and (2) campaign robustness comprises of improved supply chain flexibility, which might minimize efforts if it becomes necessary to adjust procurement and transportation plans when uncertainty arises. In addition, assessing robust solutions through Monte Carlo simulations against several realizations of uncertain parameter values indicates that, as desired, robust plan feasibility increases with the specified level of conservatism. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053452073&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-018-3015-8&partnerID=40&md5=af5a838ffad95d972d464b83f146345e,Scopus

Here, we take advantage of descriptive DM to detect and grasp important patterns among several features that coexist in a real-world automotive SC. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to analyse and understand the interrelations between ten quantitative and dependent variables in a multi-item/multi-supplier environment. Afterwards, the principal component scores are characterised via a K-means clustering, allowing us to classify the samples into four clusters and to derive different profiles for the multiple inventory items.

These, however, sometimes fail to capture interdependency among communities for basic resources. This paper aims to propose a framework for characterizing vulnerability caused by interdependency by adapting a supply chain lens. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a definition for “indirect vulnerability” that recognizes the transboundary and teleconnected nature of vulnerability arising from resource networks among cities and communities. A conceptual framework using a supply chain approach is presented for climate hazards in particular. This approach is then demonstrated through a rapid appraisal of the rice, energy and water supply chains and the waste management chains of Metro Manila. Findings: The application of the supply chain lens to assessing the indirect vulnerability of Metro Manila brings to fore issues extending beyond the decision-making boundaries of local government units. Addressing these will require vertical government coordination and horizontal inter-sectoral collaboration. Thus, this supply chain-based indirect vulnerability assessment can be complementary to traditional vulnerability assessments in providing a larger systems perspective. Originality/value: Innovative tools are needed to make community vulnerability assessments both holistic and tractable. Existing methods in the private sector can be adapted rather than reinventing the wheel. This supply chain framework can be a useful decision support and planning tool across governance levels to comprehensively address vulnerability. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015750234&doi=10.1108%2fIJCCSM-04-2015-0046&partnerID=40&md5=d74120e8ba26985ff1ac918be3b114fe,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: The three-step mediation analysis was performed using SPSS macro PROCESS to assess the mediating role of process simplification on the relationship between process integration constructs: top management commitment and supplier relationship; and upstream supply chain flexibility. Findings: The results indicate a complete mediation effect of process simplification between supplier relationship and upstream supply chain flexibility, while partial mediation effect is noticed between top management commitment and upstream supply chain flexibility. Practical implications: For Indian automotive managers, the study suggests that for improving the upstream supply chain flexibility, organizations must have a strategy towards improving the simplification of supply chain processes by upgrading technology and providing training to their suppliers. This understanding will help the automotive managers to simplify their upstream supply chain processes for gaining competitive positioning and maximizing the organizational profit. Originality/value: This study has considered the mediating role of process simplification (a relatively less studied variable) specifically in the context of its impact on upstream supply chain flexibility. Also, the presented study explores this role in the Indian automotive domain which further enhances its value for both practitioners and researchers alike. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047437767&doi=10.1108%2fIJPPM-08-2016-0159&partnerID=40&md5=9d18d1462e1a9297c7d35dbe5023987e,Scopus

In ICT product supply chains, disruptions are often observed as vulnerabilities discovered in components used in the products. The vulnerabilities can be associated with the components themselves as well as with suppliers, and they can be averted by patching and supply chain reconfiguration. The paper elaborates a simulation model for analyzing relationships between the cost of treating the vulnerabilities and the supply chain configuration. We show that flexible supply chain configurations have the lowest cost and are the most resilient to vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities associated with suppliers, for example, due to the loss of their trustworthiness, cause more-significant fluctuations in supply chain performance than the vulnerabilities associated with individual components. The monitoring cost have a significant impact on the selection of the most-resilient configuration. © 2020 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103880509&doi=10.1109%2fWSC48552.2020.9383972&partnerID=40&md5=212b09662a58d8557fb8fc2c36f1885e,Scopus

As a consequence, the synergies and trade-offs between climate change and energy security policies have not been systematically explored according to a wider understanding of the latter concept. The purpose of this article is to resolve the resulting knowledge gap by proposing a theoretical approach to energy security that is consistent with its multi-dimensional nature, taking into account the whole energy supply chain. Five key 'systemic' properties of energy security will be identified - namely, stability, flexibility, adequacy, resilience and robustness. The paper proposes a novel framework to assess energy security and uses this framework to develop a comprehensive approach to the interactions between climate change policies and energy security. The impact of a low-carbon scenario on one of these five properties (long-term robustness) will be assessed using a complex multi-regional energy system model. The results demonstrate how this scenario induces structural changes along the whole energy supply chain, revealing dynamic vulnerabilities and trade-offs that are not adequately accounted for by existing indicator-based assessments. Finally, the paper provides solid foundations for further analysis of these trade-offs using more detailed sectoral models. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899059946&doi=10.1016%2fj.apenergy.2013.12.018&partnerID=40&md5=a72ff01ac5303fa9988a13301798afd2,Scopus

This involves the reporting and publishing of various sustainability indicators. However, the demands of legal entities and customers constitute a tremendous challenge as products  in these domains comprise various components and sub-components provided by suppliers. Hence, sustainability data collection must be executed along the entire supply chain. In turn, this involves a myriad of different automated and manual tasks as well as quickly changing situations. In combination with potentially long-running processes, these issues result in great process variability that cannot be predicted at design time. In the Sustain Hub project, a dedicated information system for supporting data collection processes is developed. This paper provides three contributions: (1) it identifies core challenges for sustainable supply chain communication, (2) it reviews state-of-the-art technical solutions for such challenges, and (3) it gives a first overview of the approach we are developing in the Sustain Hub project to address the challenges.

To adapt to the market demand and policies for green products, it is urgent to build an efficient and rational logistic distribution network for the green supply chain. Many researchers have tried to design distribution networks through the coordinated optimization of the green supply chain, in the light of realistic situation. However, there are very few optimization models that consider all kinds of influencing factors. To solve the problem, this paper attempts to establish a coordinated optimization model of the complex system of the green supply chain distribution network (GSCDN). Firstly, the authors plotted the structure and game logic of the GSCDN and defined the upper limit of sales induced by the limited production capacity of producers. Secondly, the coordinated optimization conditions were configured for the distributor layer, producer layer, and market demand layer, and a coordinated optimization model was set up for the complex system. Finally, the contractual coordinated optimization mechanism was detailed for the complex system under the profit-sharing contract.

To ensure an efficient and flexible supply chain, local suppliers are appointed. However, the characteristics of materials available in each region may have minor differences, and when geometry and process design recommendations that were developed for certain materials are implemented for materials under a different regional standard, different results are obtained. Such is the case of the clutch disc spacer bolt, in which its compression during riveting has a direct effect in the noise and vibration isolation of the vehicle. It has been reported that spacer bolts produced with materials considered to be equivalent in Europe and North America (DIN C10C and SAE-AISI 1010 steels) behave different during riveting, even though they have very similar chemical compositions and are delivered with a similar UTS and ductility. The aim of this paper is to compare the compression behavior of both materials during riveting, and to explain the factors affecting the material response during compression that lead to differences in the final geometry. Finite element simulations are used for the analysis and validated experimentally by a controlled prototype production. Results indicated that 1010 steel compresses in average 0.3 mm more than C10C steel, caused by the yield stress difference. Experimental results were within the simulation results range. Microstructural analysis and microhardness measurements are reported in order to explain the deformation mechanisms. Finally, a change in the spacer bolt barrel dimension prior riveting is proposed based on finite element simulations to overcome their differences and produce a rivet under specification.

Design/methodology/approach: Using two major NDs as quasi-experiment, namely the 2011 Japanese earthquake-tsunami (JET) and Thai flood (TF), and data over the period 2010Q1-2013Q4, effect of these events on end assemblers’ performance is studied, with a focus on the personal computer (PC) supply chain. The moderating influence of delivery and sourcing – as supply chain flexibility and agility – are examined through end assemblers’ and suppliers’ inventory. The suppliers’ mediating role is captured as disruption in obtaining PC components through their sales. Findings: Only JET had any negative effect, further quantified as short-term and long-term. The TF instead portrays an insignificant but positive aftermath, which is construed as showing learning from experience and adaptability following JET. Inventory matters, but differently for the two events, and suppliers only exhibit a moderating influence on the assemblers’ disaster-performance link. Originality/value: NDs, as catastrophic vulnerabilities, are distinct from other vulnerabilities in that they are hard to predict and have significant impact. Since little is known about the impact of NDs on firm performance and how supply chain mechanisms moderate or mediate their impact, they should be distinctly modelled and empirically studied from other vulnerabilities.

In order to make supply chains more responsive and efficient, we need to identify the vulnerabilities and risk involved in supply chains. The supply chain of an organisation depends upon six driving factors; information, inventory, sourcing, pricing, facility and transportation. We classify various risks in supply chains that influence the six major drivers of it; say for example under inventory; the fluctuation of demand, capacity limitations, stock out of products etc. Similarly, under information; the risks can be legal and regulatory risk, government laws or new tax implementation, lack of point of sale (POS) data, IT cyber security, customer data mishandling, anticipating bullwhip effect etc. And under facility drivers, the associated risks can include centralised or localised production, availability for stock keeping unit and lack of proper data storage, etc. Likewise, under transportation; the major risk factors includes poor logistic supply at supplier end and increased demand for responsiveness, shorter lead times, and shorter window for on time delivery of products, etc. Also, we observe that each driver in supply chain can represent a cluster of several risks, of which some of them are listed above. We study the risk factors using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) the causal relations among risk clusters were studied using DEMATEL analysis. We also use the fish bone diagram for representation of cause and effect relationship between the risk factors within a particular cluster. The whole exercise is to prioritise the risk factors based on their causal importance and the study is based on a questionnaire based survey. Overall, managers are benefitted, as the risk factors can be prioritised and the principal causal drivers under each cluster of risks can be identified using FMEA and DEMATEL for the case of Indian manufacturing industries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107213694&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-72929-5_26&partnerID=40&md5=7ddeab5e9ac33fa3ccbf13c5451af3f0,Scopus

R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology Jalandhar, Punjab, India","Circular economy (CE) is a very wide concept, and it is spreading worldwide. With time as the population is increasing so is the pressure on limited natural resources. So, it is required to implement CE at every stage in a supply chain to make it sustainable. Every organization needs a proper balance between customer satisfaction and environmental health to cope up with future challenges. The CE is rapidly gaining momentum among business spearheads and officials in Europe, China, and other developed countries while its capability has been ignored by the developing countries so far. However, India, one of the developing countries is making an effort to crack climate-resilient development, and national legislators are investing in CE. For implementing CE in any supply chain, it is necessary to see every aspect whether it is environmental or economical. Every organization needs an ideal supply chain performance system (SCPS) to keep track of its resources and manage them effectively. An attempt has been made to make the supply chain more flexible and sustainable by identifying and assessing its hurdles. Several critical hurdles that are an obstacle for the implementation of CE in many developing countries are found out with the support of literature available, academician, and field experts. Then Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) has been applied to recognize the relationship among the hurdles. A set of directly and indirectly related hurdles are structured into a comprehensive systematic model and the matrix of cross-impact multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis has been done to categorize these hurdles into four groups, viz., autonomous, linkage, independent, and dependent. After identifying hurdles falling into the linkage cluster, prioritization has been done by using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Prioritization of the hurdles will help the decision-maker to decide the available criteria (viz. hurdles). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126233542&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-7059-6_3&partnerID=40&md5=f0da63ac2332799548d2d6b7e42f6ad3,Scopus

A sample survey was conducted to get the perspectives of small business owners in retail and consumers to understand their perspective on dynamic consumer pricing and its effects on logistics. The survey questions were structured in a way to provide perspectives on consumer experience and buying behaviour concerning dynamic pricing and gamification. The study realized retail companies are not well prepared for the logistical changes due to dynamic pricing. Traditionally, retail stores have focused on ensuring that the supply chain is responsive to client demands. For instance, leftover inventory was seen as a problem arising from poor decisions on dynamic pricing. After a promotional selling season, many of the retail respondents indicated that they face problems of when and how much to mark down leftover inventory. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Firstly,the determination of decentralized inventory decisions are investigated when the two parties optimize their individual inventory-related costs in a noncooperative manner.

However, earlier research lacks 1) an integrated framework that corresponds to diverse processes for supply chain management and 2) an explanation of how IT flexibility affects firms’ performance in the supply chain context. To fill these gaps, our study theorised a research model by integrating disparate streams of IT flexibility research with three types of IT flexibility, namely, operational, transactional, and strategic, and tested both the direct and indirect effects of the three IT flexibility types on firm performance. Our theoretical model uses an extended resource-based view to highlight the role of IT flexibility in managing interdependent firm relationships in supply chains. Using a partial least squares approach to structured equation modelling analysis on 162 questionnaires from supply chain practitioners, we found two significant relationships: (1) transactional IT flexibility affects operational IT flexibility, and (2) operational IT flexibility affects strategic IT flexibility. Transactional IT flexibility also affects strategic IT flexibility, thus playing a pivotal role in the effectiveness of the other two flexibility types. In addition, it was identified that transactional and operational flexibilities affect firm performance indirectly, via process integration capability, while strategic flexibility directly affects firm performance. By classifying diverse IT flexibility attributes into three types, a comprehensive and explicit concept of IT flexibility in inter-organisational relationships is attained, which allows practitioners to target key resource investments to realise the full potential of IT in the supply chain. © 2017 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014999600&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2017.02.018&partnerID=40&md5=6bdef62d3fe467c2c24f334366199ff4,Scopus

A performance measurement, system which includes the relationship strategy and operational measurement criteria for a supply chain partnership, has been developed. The relationship strategy contains elements of strategy orientation, management style, interdependence, mutual organisational characteristics and common goals. The operational measurement criteria consist of commitment, trust, communication behaviour, information sharing, participation decision, quality, production performance, delivery, cost, supplier strength, attitude, compromise and loyalty. The last three operational measurement criteria are found to be particularly relevant to the cross-cultural feature.

We develop the following: a framework for governance and response to enable a globally independent supply chain; a flexible structure to accommodate the requirements of state and county health systems for receiving and distributing materials; and a national material “control tower” to improve transparency and real-time access to material status and location. Context: Much of the discussion about the failure of the COVID-19 supply chain has centered on personal protective equipment (PPE) and the degree of vulnerability of care. Prior research on supply chain risks have focused on mitigating the risk of disruptions of specific purchased materials within a bounded region or on the shifting status of cross-border export restrictions. But COVID-19 has impacted every purchase category, region, and border. This paper is responsive to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommendation to study and monitor disasters and to provide governments with course of action to satisfy legislative mandates. Methods: Our analysis draws on our observations of the responses to COVID-19 in regard to acquisition and contracting problem-solving, our review of field discussions and interactions with experts, a critique of existing proposals for managing the strategic national stockpile in the United States a mapping of the responses to national contingency planning phases, and the identification of gaps in current national healthcare response policy frameworks and proposals. Findings: Current proposals call for augmenting a system that has failed to deliver the needed response to COVID-19. These proposals do not address the key attributes for pandemic plan renewal: flexibility, traceability and transparency, persistence and responsiveness, global independence, and equitable access. We offer a commons-based framework for achieving the opportunities and risks which are responsive to a constellation of intelligence assets working in and across focal targets of global supply chain risk. Conclusions: The United States needs a “commons-based strategy” that is not simply a stockpile repository but instead is a network of repositories, fluid inventories, and analytic monitoring governed by the experts. We need a coordinated effort, a “commons” that will direct both conventional and new suppliers to meet demands and to eliminate hoarding and other behaviors. © 2020 Milbank Memorial Fund",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096764931&doi=10.1111%2f1468-0009.12485&partnerID=40&md5=a79d9dffedae270d5a620080ac287869,Scopus

Lean manufacturing is a manufacturing concept which has demonstrated results of successful implementation especially in discrete manufacturing companies. This paper presents a case study of an Indian pharmaceutical firm to outline the scope of a successful lean based manufacturing strategy implementation in this sector. Analytic Network Process (ANP) is applied to measure and rate the present leanness of a pharmaceutical firm. A multi-level model along with the questionnaires developed by the authors was used for the initial assessment. The approach helped to assess the current leanness level. Since inhibitors for lean interventions were identified the authors studied them and established the correlation among different parameters using Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach. The model was also validated through MICMAC analysis. The results of ANP, ISM and MICMAC showed the root causes for the unsuccessful implementation of lean in the firm. They were the lack of a responsive supply chain and the excessive Quality regulations and enforcements by the Authorities. This study gives guidelines to companies planning for lean implementation to deploy methods to remove the inhibitors of lean at the initial stages. Identifying the barriers can guide managers in developing strategies to eliminate them at the inception. This paper recommends supplier qualification programmes which managers can use to get the suppliers be part of their extended lean family. Through this supplier's involvement can be improved with an aim of improving the product lead time. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051325235&doi=10.1088%2f1757-899X%2f390%2f1%2f012050&partnerID=40&md5=1e7aafc571b5faca66d8b0bbb6d63414,Scopus

Material flow management is the most significant issue since the inventory level in the whole supply chain could be optimized by an integrated plan. In other words, when one member of the supply chain plans to reduce its inventory level solely, despite reducing inventory in this node the inventory will be stocked in other partners' warehouses. Therefore, in this paper a new mathematical model has been developed to facilitate the process of finding the optimum solution in economic production, purchase and delivery lots and their schedules in a three-echelon supply chain environment; including raw material in suppliers, manufacturer and assembly facility as a customer. The manufacturer with a flow shop system provides its requirements from supplier, assemble multiple products, and delivers products to the customer (automotive OEM alike) on an optimum multiple delivery points. The delivery cycles would be identified through the production common cycle regarding the supply chain flexibility.

Central to these initiatives is the reconfiguration of core supply chain management (SCM) processes that underlie current production and consumption patterns. This conceptual article provides a detailed discussion of how supply chain processes can support the successful implementation of CE. The article highlights areas of convergence in hopes of sparking collaboration among scholars and practitioners in SCM, CE, and related fields. Design/methodology/approach: This article adopts a theory extension approach to conceptual development that uses CE as a “method” for exploring core processes within the domain of SCM. The article offers a discussion of the ways in which the five principles of CE (closing, slowing, intensifying, narrowing, dematerialising loops) intersect with eight core SCM processes (customer relationship management, supplier relationship management, customer service management, demand management, order fulfilment, manufacturing flow management, product development and commercialization, returns management). Findings: This article identifies specific ways in which core SCM processes can support the transition from traditional linear approaches to production and consumption to a more circular approach. This paper results in a conceptual framework and research agenda for researchers and practitioners working to adapt current supply chain processes to support the implementation of CE.

We first consider a dyadic supply chain comprising one supplier and one manufacturer in the base model and derive the equilibrium solutions of dynamic emission abatement in decentralized and centralized systems, respectively. In the decentralized supply chain, we consider both unilateral sharing and bilateral participation contracts and examine the feedback equilibrium strategies and trajectories of emission abatement of all parties. By comparison, we find that the bilateral contract leads to lower emission abatement and higher profits of all players and the system than that under unilateral sharing contract. Meanwhile, we show that the properly-designed bilateral participation contract can coordinate the decentralized dyadic supply chain. By extending the base model, we further figure out the equilibria and optimal trajectories for the dynamic cooperative emission abatement and the associated mechanism design in a supply chain with two competing suppliers and one manufacturer. Interestingly, we find that the bilateral participation contract can also coordinate the competing channels with competitive or complementary components at the upstream level. We uncover that the bilateral participation contract is effective in coordinating supply chains with dynamic cooperative emission abatement since it can overcome the disadvantage of uneven distribution of emission-reducing capability endowments among chain members. Finally, we also conduct computational and sensitivity analyses to illustrate the previous results. These findings provide potential implications for firms’ dynamic cooperation in emission abatement. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108811806&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-021-04134-9&partnerID=40&md5=fc3d99a943fa392c8722546962139f5f,Scopus

It induced retailers to accelerate the adoption of technologies to make their supply chains more flexible and resilient. Before COVID-19, the apparel industry had gradually adopted virtual dressing room (VDR) technologies and crowd wisdom software, both of which reduce the risk associated with online purchases. Apparel retailers also altered the structure of their supply chains by outsourcing product turns via third-party logistics providers.

Box 17, 6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","The microbial formation of trimethylamine (TMA) can be used as a quality indicator compound to predict the freshness of fish during its shelf life. In a supply chain with fluctuating temperatures, mathematical models will be valuable tools to simulate this formation as a function of temperature and time. These models are essential to link sensor data on the formation of TMA to the actual freshness of fish. Existing models for the formation of TMA in fish needed improvements and secondary models for the effect of temperature on the formation of TMA are lacking in the literature. Three different approaches were evaluated on their ability to simulate the experimental observed TMA formation at 4 different temperatures (0, 5, 10 and 15°C). In the first approach the existing models were improved and the temperature effect was modelled by an empirical model using four parameters. This model is able to simulate the TMA formation at static temperatures. Since TMA is produced on fresh cod fillets by the micro-organisms Shewanella putrefaciens and Photobacterium phosphoreum the microbial Baranyi-Roberts model was initially used for modelling the TMA formation, but this model was found to be too complex (too many correlated parameters that could not be estimated). In the third approach it was seen that a simplified Baranyi-Roberts model with only three parameters could be used to predict the TMA formation with equal accuracy. The influence of the temperature on the parameter μmax was modelled using the extended square root model of Ratkowsky and the differences in TMA formation profiles of different batches could be described by the batch specific parameter N0 representing the initial quality. The presented dynamic model is valuable in predicting the formation of TMA in a fresh fish supply chain with dynamic temperatures. This model has the potential to be used to link sensor data of TMA in the headspace to the actual freshness status of the fish. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893002859&doi=10.1016%2fj.foodres.2014.01.011&partnerID=40&md5=33658235e621db0c89ccc95ea89b9d76,Scopus

The implementation of the circular model entails the adaptation of supply chains. In connection with sustainability, we also need to consider economic, social and environmental dimensions. This makes the evaluation of the circular systems more complex. In the past, various means are presented in the literature to evaluate and understand the sustainable dimensions for the development of the circular economy.

Thus, a greater understanding of the factors that influence organizational failure and reduce supply chain resilience is essential to underpin agile and dynamic food supply chains. Scope and approach: The aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of system level factors that influence organizational failure in food supply chains in order to conceptualize the horizontal and vertical interaction of such factors at the three levels described: the micro system, the meso system and the macro system level. A systematic review, based on a specific search strategy, incorporated articles from the fields of management, business and economics research. Whilst 616 articles were initially identified, only 41 of these were within the established inclusion criteria and reviewed. A model of organizational failure, determined here as “The House of Cards Model”, is developed, that can then be empirically tested in further research. Key findings and conclusions: A hierarchy was developed to contextualize the factors deemed to be of influence. The macro (external environment) level includes criteria such as economic conditions, formal institutions, government policies, competitors and rumors. The factors addressed in the meso (organizational) level include organization age and size, location, property structure, client, supplier and shareholder relationships, financial resources, physical resources, human resources and succession process. At the micro (individual) level the managers’ skill, characteristics, actions and mindset are of influence.

In this paper remanufacturing is examined as a key enabler of circular practices, and the concept of “Product-Agnostic Manufacturing” (PAR) is proposed. This work differentiates PAR from many traditional approaches to remanufacturing by virtue of PAR's treatment of product variety. Most existing approaches to remanufacturing feature low variety and standardisation; this study instead suggests that the exploitation of flexibilities in both operations and supply chains leads to new competitive strategies for firms to exploit. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual study that builds on a thorough exploration of contemporary remanufacturing literature in the development of the new PAR concept. Findings: Through a detailed literature review it is shown that there are a range of benefits, challenges, and critical success factors that underpin the remanufacturing concept. Building on this understanding and bridging literature in operations flexibility and supply chain design, a detailed discussion on the nature of PAR is provided, and an agenda for future research developed. Originality/value: Whilst there has been much literature on remanufacturing, there is a general tendency to treat supply chain and remanufacturing operations quite distinctly in individual articles. Additionally, there has been little consideration of multi-product remanufacturing, and for the limited studies where this is done, the emphasis is typically on problem avoidance. This study aims to provide a detailed insight into the developed PAR concept, showing how the remanufacture of a wide range of product varieties may be achieved through flexible operations and supply chain design. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132906736&doi=10.1108%2fIJLM-11-2021-0556&partnerID=40&md5=a58aca8e36d004b1785c14b1816a16e9,Scopus

Complex decision making processes on strategic, tactical, and operational levels require substantial timely support in order to contribute to organizations' agility. Consequently, there is a need for sophisticated dynamic product pricing mechanisms that can adapt quickly to changing market conditions and competitors' strategies. We propose a two-layered machine learning approach to compute tactical pricing decisions in real time. The first layer estimates prevailing economic conditions-economic regimes-identifying and predicting current and future market conditions. In the second layer, we train a neural network for each regime to estimate price distributions in real time using available information. The neural networks compute offer acceptance probabilities from a tactical perspective to meet desired sales quotas. We validate our approach in the trading agent competition for supply chain management. When competing against the world's leading agents, the performance of our system significantly improves compared to using only economic regimes to predict prices. Profits increase significantly even though the prices and sales volume do not change significantly. Instead, tactical pricing results in a more efficient sales strategy by reducing both finished goods and components inventory costs. © 2015 Decision Sciences Institute.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940453538&doi=10.1111%2fdeci.12146&partnerID=40&md5=471d4934fc24ac5eea9065b1e8f87099,Scopus

The capability of DDM to improve the sustainability of products and processes is based on changing operational practices in product design, distribution, use, and after-sales services. Although research has provided evidence of the potential impact of DDM technologies, there is limited research on how specific DDM-based operational practices add to the operational capabilities of a manufacturer and how these capabilities can be used to improve sustainability outcomes. To address this research gap, we evaluate how current and future DDM-based operational practices can be used to improve products and processes. The analyzed current practices are in prototyping, tooling, on-demand parts manufacturing, and customized parts manufacturing. Two future practices that are evaluated are DDM-based incremental product improvement and dynamic supply chain reconfiguration. Based on the evaluation of current and future practices, we propose a design theory for the introduction of DDM into manufacturing firms for improving sustainability capabilities. The key contribution of this article is specifying the mechanisms by which a specific DDM-based operational practice improves sustainability outcomes and how each practice creates an operational practice threshold that needs to be reached before further improvement of capabilities is possible. Thus, using the theory new operational practices can be proactively developed and tested before the next threshold is reached. This in turn will help manufacturers develop strategies and investment plans for current and future DDM-based practices and to accumulate sustainability capabilities faster. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016064264&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2017.03.092&partnerID=40&md5=cc946758aacfc6cd5293b70c6520f23e,Scopus

As in reality, blood donors play a critical role in the BSC; this study undertakes motivational initiatives to encourage blood donors for maintaining sufficient blood supply. Advertisement, education and medical credits are the directions incorporated to construct the motivational function. To observe the efficiency as the most critical factor while evaluating the pool of location alternatives for establishing facilities, an augmented version of data envelopment analysis (DEA) is utilized. In addition, a mixed integer programming model is proposed by which the simultaneous location and capacity decisions are supported. The model is also extended to handle the combinatorial risk of uncertainty as well as disruption. Thus, a novel mixed possibilistic-stochastic flexible robust programming (MPSFRP) is developed.

Based on a resource-based view of the firm, this study develops a research framework for investigating the mediating role of supply chain capabilities in the relationships between IT infrastructure flexibility, integration, and firms’ performance. Data for the study were collected from 270 companies in the Taiwanese electronics industry and the relationships proposed in the framework were tested using the Partial Least Squares method. The results indicate that IT infrastructure integration and flexibility indirectly and positively impact organizational performance through the mediating effect of supply chain capability, and the mediating effect is a full mediation.

The results demonstrate that the online review system increases both the bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification, and this impact can be moderated by product quality, unit mismatch cost, lead time, and customer volatility. We further explore how our model could be extended to include market competition, dual sourcing, online review manipulation, and product returns.

Findings: The authors’ empirical findings show that configuration flexibility has a greater influence on exploratory partnerships, while manufacturing flexibility has a greater impact on exploitative partnerships.

The proposed model highlights that there are both direct and indirect effects between structural SC complexity and SC resilience, however dynamic SC complexity only influences SC resilience via BDA. These findings provide strategic insights for SC executives as to where to invest in BDA to build much-needed SC resilience. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124283392&doi=10.1080%2f09537287.2022.2032450&partnerID=40&md5=fee852d9d093a932d8eee4a7b0a97ae7,Scopus

The authors focus on consumer-driven and responsive fruit supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose a new conceptual framework that links fruit consumption to innovation implementation strategies. A total of 36 experts in four panels organised, respectively, in Spain, Poland, Greece, and The Netherlands evaluated the elements of the proposed framework. Findings: ""Market orientation"" and ""continuous learning and knowledge acquisition"" surfaced as the innovation implementation strategies with the highest success potential. However, the optimal mix of strategies depends on the particular innovation as well as the geographic and cultural characteristics of the targeted consumer population. Furthermore, improving technological competence is the single most important factor affecting fruit innovation adoption. Research limitations/implications: The reported results are derived from four small groups of purposefully chosen experts and supply chain stakeholders. Nevertheless, they provide new insights useful to policy makers, consumers, and entrepreneurs. Practical implications: In designing innovations, fruit chain actors should first and foremost consider the price premium consumers will have to pay. Furthermore, for some innovations geographic or cultural characteristics become very important. Therefore, fruit supply chains should design their innovation implementation strategies accordingly. Social implications: By adopting efficiently designed innovation implementation strategies, consumer-driven fruit supply chains will convince consumers to eat more fruit. Thus, given the critical contribution of fruit consumption to human health, an important social goal is achieved. Originality/value: While the literature on innovation is enormous, very little has been published on innovation implementation strategies adopted by consumer-driven and responsive fruit chains. The significance of addressing the previously mentioned issues stems from the need to increase fruit consumption in Europe, which lags behind the levels suggested by physicians and nutrition scientists. Fruit-related innovations are a useful means to achieving this goal. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862569678&doi=10.1108%2f00070701211234336&partnerID=40&md5=e64bf60ee897bdb2ec9e3d0d5109cc4b,Scopus

In the perspective of its protection, supply chain performance is important to be assessed, especially on its industrial aspect. Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) is a method of self-assessment and a comparison of activities in the supply chain performance evaluation using five attributes; reliability, responsiveness, costs, assets management, and agility. Measurements with SCOR method presents a framework of business processes, performance indicators, best practices, as well as a unique technology to support communication and collaboration inter-supply chain, so as to improve the effectiveness of supply chain management and the effectiveness of supply chain improvement. SCOR focused on causality of the steps that are shaped linear correlation. This state of condition appears to be the weakness of SCOR method, because it cannot continue more specific steps forward that can predict performance. In this study, SCOR in combination with System Dynamics (SD) can identify the four perspectives and their interaction variables associated with causal loop design model. The design of a hybrid model SCOR-SD provides more effective and interesting value. Furthermore, the simulation of the model from data inputs in 2014 creates prediction until 2019. The results obtained for the reliability attributes associated with perfect order fulfillment started in 2015 to 2019 respectively 85.16% to 91.06%.

Survey data from a sample of 148 firms, in the garment manufacturing industry, in Pakistan were analyzed using partial least square methods. Findings: The results revealed that supply flexibility (i.e. volume and mix) mediates the effect of PI on supply chain agility. Supply chain agility, in turn, influences a firm’s business performance. Furthermore, the competence‒capability framework is not consistent across the varying degrees of product complexity such as product complexity hinders the effect of supply flexibility on supply chain agility, whereas it amplifies the impact of PI on supply chain agility. The conditional indirect effects suggest that the indirect effect of PI on supply chain agility through supply flexibility becomes stronger when product complexity is high.

This study focuses on a new category of vehicle trades where dealers trade vehicles that are still under production (order-trades) and in the delivery phase of the order-fulfillment process (distribution-trades). Using empirical data in an experimental design setting, order- and distribution-trades are shown to improve flexibility in order fulfillment, with no additional costs for the manufacturer. Different managerial levers such as trade fees and trade caps are evaluated to develop insights for managing vehicle trades.

Reacting to the pandemic and adaptation in the “new normal” have been challenging tasks. Exiting the pandemic can lead to some after-shock effects such as “disruption tails.” While the research community has undertaken considerable efforts to predict the pandemic’s impacts and examine supply chain adaptive behaviors during the pandemic, little is known about supply chain management in the course of pandemic elimination and post-disruption recovery. If capacity and inventory management are unaware of the after-shock risks, this can result in highly destabilized production–inventory dynamics and decreased performance in the post-disruption period causing product deficits in the markets and high inventory costs in the supply chains. In this paper, we use a discrete-event simulation model to investigate some exit strategies for a supply chain in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model can inform managers about the existence and risk of disruption tails in their supply chains and guide the selection of post-pandemic recovery strategies. Our results show that supply chains with postponed demand and shutdown capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic are particularly prone to disruption tails. We then developed and examined two strategies to avoid these disruption tails. First, we observed a conjunction of recovery and supply chain coordination which mitigates the impact of disruption tails by demand smoothing over time in the post-disruption period. Second, we found a gradual capacity ramp-up prior to expected peaks of postponed demand to be an effective strategy for disruption tail control. © 2021, The Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103544206&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-021-04047-7&partnerID=40&md5=31f3de8f0566f701823c02f5938ef736,Scopus

This, however, can be inefficient. Moreover, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed difficulties in the timely deployments of resilience assets and their utilization for value creation. We present a framework that consolidates different angles of efficient resilience and renders utilization of resilience capabilities for creation of value. Design/methodology/approach: We conceptualise the design of the AURA (Active Usage of Resilience Assets) framework for post-COVID-19 supply chain management through collating the extant literature on value creation-oriented resilience and practical examples and complementing our analysis with a discussion of practical implementations. Findings: Building upon and integrating the existing frameworks of VSC (Viable Supply Chain), RSC (Reconfigurable Supply Chain) and LCNSC (Low-Certainty-Need Supply Chain), we elaborate on a new idea in the AURA approach – to consider resilience as an inherent, active and value-creating component of operations management decisions, rather than as a passive “shield” to protect against rare, severe events. We identify 10 future research areas for lean resilience integrating management and digital platforms and technology. Practical implications: The outcomes of our study can be used by supply chain and operations managers to improve the efficiency and effectiveness by turning resilience from passive, cost-driving assets into a value-creating, inclusive decision-making paradigm. Originality/value: We propose a novel approach to bring more dynamics to the notion of supply chain resilience.

Subsequently, an algorithm of decision-making on supply chain planning regarding ensuring both supply chain reliability and flexibility is presented. The quantitative approaches and formal tools are based on the modern control theory in combination with operations research techniques, global stability, controlled adaptation and the use of attainable sets. The developed framework and tools which are supporting it allow us to find this balance with regard to supply chain protection and adaptability. Moreover, it makes it possible to take into account individual risk perceptions of managers, different strategies with regard to risk management, and to consider not only supply chain economic performance but also supply chain stability, which is becoming more and more important in ongoing economic transformation. The developed framework contributes both to the methodical part of SCM and to its practical part where the developed methodical guidelines can be localized for concrete application issues.

Both supply chain schedule generation and execution control are represented as an optimal program control problem in combination with mathematical programming and interpreted as a dynamic process of operations control within an adaptive framework. Hence, the problems and models of planning, scheduling, and adaptation can be consistently integrated on a unified mathematical axiomatic of modern control theory. In addition, operations control and flow control models are integrated and applicable for both discrete and continuous processes. The application of optimal control for supply chain scheduling becomes possible by formulating the scheduling model as a linear non-stationary finite-dimensional controlled differential system with the convex area of admissible control and a reconfigurable structure. For this model class, theorems of optimal control existence can be used regarding supply chain scheduling. The essential structural property of this model are the linear right parts of differential equations. This allows applying methods of discrete optimization for optimal control calculation. The calculation procedure is based on applying Pontryagin's maximum principle and the resulting essential reduction of problem dimensionality that is under solution at each instant of time. The gained insights contribute to supply chain scheduling theory, providing advanced insights into dynamics of the whole supply chains (and not any dyadic relations in them) and transition from a partial ""one-way"" schedule optimization to the feedback loop-based dynamic and adaptive supply chain planning and scheduling. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861231928&doi=10.1007%2fs10951-010-0189-6&partnerID=40&md5=571f598303e18c83a881bd3871e39c67,Scopus

From this perspective, control theory (CT) is an interesting research avenue for the supply chain management (SCM). In this paper, the applicability of optimal CT to SCM is investigated. Our analysis is based on the fundamentals of control and systems theory and experimental modeling. The paper describes important issues and perspectives that delineate dynamics in supply chains, identifies and systemizes different streams in application of CT to production, logistics, and SCM in the period from 1960 to 2011. It derives some classifications, performs a critical analysis, and discusses further researches. Some drawbacks and missing links in the literature are pointed out. Several crucial application areas of control theory to SCM are discussed. Subsequently, optimal program control, challenges and advantages of its application in the SCM are addressed. It is shown how optimal program control can be applied to adaptive supply chain planning. In addition, it is concluded that with the help of CT, robustness, adaptability, and resilience of supply chains can be investigated in their consistency with operations planning and execution control within a conceptually and mathematically integrated framework. However, although SCs resemble control systems, they have some peculiarities which do not allow a direct application of CT methods. In this setting, further development of interdisciplinary approaches to supply chain optimization is argued. An extended co-operation between control and supply chain experts may have the potential to introduce more realism to the dynamic planning and models and improve real-time supply chain control policies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the literature analysis, we develop a qualitative adaptive framework for sustainable supply networks that is composed of the integrated elements of environment management, operations economic development and information technologies, productlife-cycle management, and social development. Subsequently, we develop a quantitative adaptive framework for sustainable supply networks. As sustainable systems are designed to support decisions on planning, analysis and improving organization's actions and operations to meet competitiveness and sustainability goals, it becomes necessary to interconnectthe stages of supply network planning and execution. Indeed, as supply networks are not static but highly dynamic and permanently evolving systems, sustainability of these networks should also be considered as a dynamic category of supply chain (SC) adaptive evolution. Mathematical framework is based on a combined application of operations research and modern control theory. Finally, we address the issue of interrelating environment and economic sustainability and propose to consider the SC property to achieve a balance between the economic output performance and resource consumption as the SC global stability. The proposed framework can be employed as a competitive strategy to increase organizations' wealth and sustainability by producing demand-corresponding products in a cost-effective manner through an increase of SC agility, resilience, stability, and adaptation capabilities. © 2012 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Based on the literature review carried-out, it was found that many researchers have studied the supply chain performance using metrics at supply stage, manufacturing stage and distribution stage. Length of the supply chain of products is one of the important metrics to evaluate the supply chain performance. When it comes to perishable products, length of supply chain measured in terms of time indicates how fast the product moves and reaches the costumer hands from the time of manufacturing. No study has been attempted so far to measure the supply chain using time duration for perishable products. This paper focuses on measuring the supply chain length of products manufactured in one of the leading milk products manufacturing company located in Erode, an emerging city in south India. The sampling frame comprises the retailers those deals with dairy products in Erode district. A random sampling method is used by selecting 64 retailers. Retailers located in seven small cities in Erode district were considered for the study. Retailers taken for the study include those sell dairy and related products. 168 complete filled-in forms were collected directly in person from the owners of retailers. Five fast moving products were selected for the study that includes Panner, Lassi, Cheese, Curd and Ghee. Primary data were collected using a questionnaire. The length of the supply chain was arrived using the methodology based on time factors at the manufacturing stage, retailer stage and customer stage. Data on primary variables viz. Stock level, sales quantity, and date of manufacture were collected to determine the supply chain length.

The vendor serves as a manufacturer who produces items, while the buyer serves as a retailer who buys the items from the vendor and sells them to end customers. In addition to utilizing regular production as a production base, the vendor also uses green production. Green production adopts green technology, which comprises environmentally friendly inventions that are used to reduce emissions. Green production is more costly than regular production, but it generates lower emissions. The production rate is adjustable, which enables decision makers to control the emissions and production cost. The objective of this study is to find the optimal production allocation, ordering quantity, shipment frequency, safety factor, and production rate such that the joint total cost is minimized. An algorithm is suggested to solve the mathematical problems and its application is validated with a numerical example. The results show that the changes in the emissions, carbon tax, and production cost parameters exhibit significant effects in determining the optimal production allocation. Furthermore, by controlling the production rate flexibly, the supply chain can lessen the emissions released during production and maintain the total cost. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to explain the usage of the proposed model. © 2022",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129753356&doi=10.1016%2fj.apm.2022.04.012&partnerID=40&md5=9e508117e6e5ba8a4d46ec46fe336601,Scopus

This paper studies the optimal pricing decisions in a dual-channel supply chain (SC) —consists of a manufacturer and a retailer— under different government intervention policies, namely ES, revenue seeking, social welfare, and sustainable development. We develop an extended dual-channel SC model under flexible return policies, including full-refund via the direct (i.e., manufacturer) channel, the indirect (i.e., retailer) channel, and both direct and indirect channels. A dynamic multi-level Stackelberg game approach is used to examine the SC interactions and characterize the return strategy, optimal pricing, and ES level decisions under different scenarios. The results show that employing full-refund via the indirect channel policy under price incentive schemes not only maximizes the profit of dual-channel SC but also satisfies the government's objective functions. In contrast to other intervention policies, the revenue seeking policy does not necessarily improve the social welfare and energy saving level unless the government budget is increased. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067868354&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2019.06.014&partnerID=40&md5=24ba2283b0dd92794d18ae03dac9e0a0,Scopus

With the increase of natural disasters and global issues such as water shortages, acid rain and climate change companies have started focusing on reducing their carbon footprint to ensure that the world’s natural resources are sustained for the foreseeable future. Many international and local companies are now looking to incorporate green initiatives into their supply chain management. This has given rise to green supply chain management which is the incorporation of sustainable initiatives into the supply chain of a company. Designing green supply chains (GSCs) requires complex decision support models that can deal with multiple dimensions of sustainability and specific characteristics of products and supply chain. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches can be used to quantify trade-offs between economic, social, and environmental criteria i.e. to identify green production options. This study presents a hybrid decision-making approach for group multi-criteria evaluation for green supply chain management (GSCM) implementation criteria, which clubs many green processes with order allocation for dynamic supply chains to cope market variations. More specifically, the developed approach imitates the knowledge acquisition and manipulation in a manner like the decision makers who have gathered considerable knowledge and expertise in this domain. Fuzzy DEMATEL is first applied to find the causal relationship between the criteria and to rank them. Fuzzy SWARA method is used for evaluation of GSCM implementation criteria weights, which are qualitatively meaningful. Thereafter, using fuzzy TOPSIS method, the criteria application is quantitatively evaluated again for order allocation of criteria. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed hybrid framework, a real-life case study is presented in the chapter, and the results are analysed accordingly. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123073446&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-25778-1_4&partnerID=40&md5=c5f9ddb4fecd1bc01036e7f2400cba8c,Scopus

As prefabricated building manufacturers and assemblers are emerging in the market, how do they make decisions of pricing, ordering, and emission reduction? In this paper, game theory is used to make the decisions for the prefabricated building supply chain with flexible cap-and-trade and different power structures, i.e., using prefabricated building manufacturers as the leader, using the vertical Nash equilibrium, and using prefabricated building assemblers as the leader. The two-part tariff contract is designed to coordinate the supply chain and to improve the supply chain performance. Moreover, we discuss the influence of different power structures and the two-part tariff contract on the optimal decisions and profits. Finally, numerical analysis is used to verify the conclusions. This indicates that the supply chain leaders will gain a higher profit and that the power structure has a significant influence on the two-part tariff contract, which will result in an unfair distribution of profit.

One emerging way for such flexible manufacturing is so-called ""factory-in-A-box,"" by which production modules are installed in a container and transported by a vehicle. The factory-in-A-box manufacturing poses a unique challenge to manufacturing supply chain network since the ease of supply chain reconfiguration when the vehicle moves to a different production site has become a major concern in addition to transportation cost and delivery time. The supply chain design is further complicated by the fact that it is coupled with subassembly planning in manufacturing, which determines appropriate subassembly modules assigned to suppliers. As such, it is critical to understand the interaction between supply chain network reconfigurability and subassembly planning. This paper develops a model using a set of decision variables to jointly characterize the topology of supply chain network and subassembly planning. A binary nonlinear programming model has been developed for the concurrent optimization of subassembly planning and supply chain network with the consideration of reconfiguration of the supply chain structure. One numerical case study was conducted to demonstrate the proposed model by providing a quantitative guideline of reconfiguring supply chain network when the final production site (on a vehicle) changes locations.

This paper studies the optimization of the integrated planning and scheduling problem of a two-stage supply chain with multiple manufacturers and multiple retailers to obtain a minimum supply chain operating cost, whose manufacturers have different production capacities, holding and producing cost rates, transportation costs to retailers. Design/methodology/approach: As a complex task allocation and scheduling problem, this paper sets up an INLP model for it and designs a Unit Cost Adjusting (UCA) heuristic algorithm that adjust the suppliers’ supplying quantity according to their unit costs step by step to solve the model. Findings: Relying on the contrasting analysis between the UCA and the Lingo solvers for optimizing many numerical experiments, results show that the INLP model and the UCA algorithm can obtain its near optimal solution of the two-stage supply chain’s planning and scheduling problem within very short CPU time. Research limitations/implications: The proposed UCA heuristic can easily help managers to optimizing the two-stage supply chain scheduling problems which doesn’t include the delivery time and batch of orders. For two-stage supply chains are the most common form of actual commercial relationships, so to make some modification and study on the UCA heuristic should be able to optimize the integrated planning and scheduling problems of a supply chain with more reality constraints.

Such conditions are then used to find the robust Nash controls for a linear affine quadratic game affected by a square integrable uncertainty, which is seen as a malicious fictitious player trying to maximize the cost function of each player. The approach allows us to find robust strategies in the solution of a group of coupled Riccati differential equation.

This study expands the research on ITs impact on competitive performance by focusing on IT-enabled sharing capability and the indirect effect of this capability on firm performance. Most prior research focused on the technical aspects of IT infrastructure and tested direct relationships. In this research, a large-scale survey was used to collect 198 responses from U.S. manufacturers to investigate this framework. Structural Equation Modeling was used to examine and test the measurement and structural models. The results indicated that IT-enabled sharing capability is associated with flexibilities in a manufacturers supply chain, which in turn are associated with the firms competitive performance. This finding suggests that a firm should focus on flexibilities in the supply chain to improve its performance. IT-enabled sharing capability is an antecedent for improving these flexibilities.

Empirical data from four case-studies on cyclones and floods were collected to study and analyze humanitarian response operations. This includes data from 142 interviews, participant observation and documents obtained during field visits. The analysis revealed that supply chain visibility had a positive influence on both reactivity and volume flexibility. However, in-station last mile logistical capabilities mediated the relationship between reactivity and velocity of the supply chain. Delivery flexibility was observed to be dependent on reactivity. The results suggest that humanitarian organizations should focus on enhancing last mile delivery capabilities, communication and infrastructural resilience, and improve training of field forces for disaster-specific operations. Community involvement was observed to have a positive effect on response operations. This paper is the first to study agility of response operations for water based disasters. The insights will be useful for practitioners and researchers to build models that are more realistic.

In this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for dynamic design of a supply chain network is proposed. In this model, multiple products and multiple transportation modes, the time value of money, traffic congestion, and both supply-side and demand-side uncertainties are considered. Due to the complexity of such models, conventional solution methods are not applicable; therefore, two hybrid Electromagnetism-Like Algorithms (EMA) are designed and discussed for tackling the problem.

We propose an integrated approach that uses Big Data mining techniques to study the effect of these decisions on the quality of the final product and determine our state transition matrix. From there, stochastic optimization methods are implemented to find an optimal policy describing the preferred suppliers and settings for their process parameters.

The proposed model is to integrate environmental considerations into a flexible supply chain as an optimization framework. The first objective function is to minimize the costs, while the second one minimizes the environmental impacts of automotive industry. The goal of this paper is to find a trade-off between the total cost and the environmental pollution with regard to the supply chain flexibility dimensions. We suggest adding four different supply chain flexibility dimensions to the model which are budget for transportation, trained labor team to help the packaging process, number of active plants, and outsourcing the painting process flexibilities to curb harmful emissions from factories while reducing the costs. Six flexibility scenarios are proposed in this study to do the sensitivity analysis. The model is applicable with the use of a real data set derived from an automotive parts factory located in Iran.

In Malaysia this technologically enhanced method is known as the Indutrialised Building System (IBS). Concerted efforts have been made for the past decade by various responsible parties especially by the government. Therefore, the IBS 'Road Map' 2003-2010 was introduced and now continues with the IBS 'road map' 2011-2015. However, its performance is still at its infancy, which target is only at an initial stage. This study seeks to identify and analyse the factor of the IBS' system's supply chain flexibility as a factor on the success of the system itself. It has been a suspicion that there exists a condition and situation where the supply chain is too rigid and is not flexible in fulfilling the needs and demands of the IBS development in Malaysia. This inflexible situation has brought about a broad range of problems and has stood in the way of the development of the industrialised building system, despite it being introduced since 1964, or 49 years ago. Flexibility in the IBS supply chain is very important and is associated with other industries like transportation, manufacturing industry, and others. Up until now, we have yet to discover any special studies related to the flexibility in the IBS supply chain in this country. Responding to this challenge, this research is hoped to be able to provide sufficient feedback to the solution to the IBS supply chain flexibility issue. The researcher is confident that the poor system flow of supply chain has impeded the advancement of the Industrialised Building System that has long been open to debate. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84906653911&doi=10.1051%2fmatecconf%2f20141501036&partnerID=40&md5=847506aa338affcf585a83551ec961fd,Scopus

In supply chain, carbon emissions are seen right away from the procurement of raw materials till the distribution of finished goods through logistics. Hence, there is strong need to fix carbon emissions and to make existing supply chain an environmentally sustainable supply chain to gain environmental disaster relief. This paper primarily focuses on minimizing carbon emissions in the raw material procurement and its logistics using a cap-and-trade method. In the raw material procurement and logistics, the carbon emission is caused during the ordering, transporting and holding the procured items from various suppliers. The paper aims to model sustainability-resilience link at the supply chain design level through the procurement and logistics of raw material which is considered as the primary stage of any supply chain. A dynamic non-linear mixed integer model featuring an environmental sustainability through cap-and-trade method of carbon emission is proposed that can be used to design sustainable procurement logistics for disaster resilient supply chain management. The proposed model in the paper is referred as SPL_DRSCM (sustainable procurement and logistics for disaster resilient supply chain management) and is validated through illustrations. Important useful managerial and practical insights are obtained from set of five different deterministic data sets. Proposed model for SPL_DRSCM MINLP shows significant cost saving while optimizing procurement and its logistics under carbon emission constraint.

The original goal was to propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. Now, Blockchain proves to have the capacity to deliver a new kind of trust to a wide range of services. Applications are being explored in healthcare (patient records), government (land registries) and electronics (Internet of Things). The supply chain is one of the fields that Blockchain is expected to be applied. The paper aims to combine blockchain with distributed storage and propose blockchain for the supply chain. Blockchain is not fit to record a lot of information. It requires both on-chain storage of the core ledger data and off-chain storage of data required by smart contracts for verification and documentation. The Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) is a concrete solution. IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. Participants can address large amounts of data with IPFS and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures their content, without having to put the data itself on the chain. By combining blockchain with distributed storage, the supply chain system is fit to the industry of the next generation. The characteristics of Industry 4.0 meets the blockchain-based system and the model can aid these changes. © 2019 The Authors.

To ensure sustainability and resilience in face of the problems that arise in globalizing supply chains, it is becoming an important issue today; a supply chain must be flexible, agile and responsive. Therefore, the aim of the study is to focus on resilience in sustainable global supply chains (GSC) to avoid disruptions caused by pandemics such as COVID-19; it is also conducted research on responsiveness of sustainable global supply chains during COVID-19. In this study, dynamic capability perspective and contingency theory are used to conceptualize theoretical models for COVID-19. Moreover, a partial least squares (PLS) model is used to analyse the research hypotheses with 200 responses collected from companies which have complex supply chain structures. As a novel result, the relationship between flexibility, agility and responsiveness of global supply chain is revealed. Supply chain agility is found to be directly affected by supply chain flexibility. Moreover, supply chain flexibility and supply chain agility directly affect the responsiveness of the global supply chain.

In the literature, it is generally assumed that all the channel members are risk-neutral, ignoring the influences of channel members' risk attitudes in the face of dynamic market. This paper focuses on a pricing problem in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with two competitive risk-sensitive retailers under uncertain environment. The uncertainty is associated with the recycling costs, consumer demands and remanufacturing costs. Due to the dynamic market, supply chain managers may be unable to collect enough historical data to estimate these demands and costs when making pricing and remanufacturing decisions. In such cases, experts' estimations are usually employed to describe these uncertain parameters. To deal with these human estimations, an uncertainty theory-based model is proposed. Based on the equilibrium results, how the retailers' risk sensitivity and human estimations (uncertain degrees) affect the prices and profits is analyzed. It is found that both the retailers will get lower profits while the manufacturer will gain more profit when either of the two retailers becomes more risk-averse. We also find that a higher level of uncertainty in the supply chain will induce a higher collecting rate. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Co.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040579842&doi=10.1142%2fS0217595918500033&partnerID=40&md5=b4cc91be70dd2d082fb4d7d118923d0e,Scopus

Despite the interim government's eviction drives aimed at slum dwellers and street vendors, the food hawkers still managed to distribute prepared food throughout the city. And despite rapidly rising food prices, most of the urban poor found ways to endure the crisis. In this article, we look at the people who made Dhaka's food system resilient enough to avoid catastrophe. We discuss three relevant actor groups - food traders in wholesale markets, street food vendors, and poor consumers - and investigate the roles they play in keeping the city fed, and how they act in the light of crises.

This paper aims to demonstrate how a deep reinforcement learning agent based on the proximal policy optimization algorithm can synchronize inbound and outbound flows and support business continuity operating in the stochastic and nonstationary environment if end-to-end visibility is provided. The deep reinforcement learning agent is built upon the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, which does not require hardcoded action space and exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. These features, complimented with a straightforward supply chain environment, give rise to a general and task unspecific approach to adaptive control in multi-echelon supply chains. The proposed approach is compared with the base-stock policy, a well-known method in classic operations research and inventory control theory. The base-stock policy is prevalent in continuous-review inventory systems. The paper concludes with the statement that the proposed solution can perform adaptive control in complex supply chains.

Design/methodology/approach – Through a single, embedded case design, a range of methods are used to collect data from companies representing three different supply chain tiers, including focal company, first-tier suppliers and first-tier customers. The collected data are analysed through the theoretical lens of interdependence. Findings – The findings indicate that the supply chain actors adapt information sharing to the pooled, serial or reciprocal type of interdependence. Information sharing is thus increased with key dyadic partners representing, for example, unique offerings and high market shares as percentage of total expenditure/sales. The study also unearths several barriers to information sharing beyond dyadic ties, including problems related to dis-aggregated, misinterpreted and/or incomplete information. Research limitations/implications – The study empirically contributes to the existing literature by exploring information sharing in the extended supply chain and by suggesting different approaches to information sharing depending on the type and intensity of interdependence between supply chain partners. Further, the paper contributes to the existing literature on barriers of information sharing in supply chains by identifying barriers specific to multi-tier information sharing. “Meta-information” (i.e. information about the shared information) is needed to overcome some of the barriers of sharing information in cases of weak, pooled interdependencies in the supply chain. Practical implications – Similar to previous empirical research, this exploratory study indicates that companies, in general, refrain from sharing information beyond dyadic ties. Supply chain managers would instead mostly focus on stronger, reciprocal interdependencies and emphasise dyadic information sharing. To further guide managers, a demand profiling framework considering market share and demand uncertainty is presented. It may be interesting to engage in multi-tier information sharing in particular cases where strong interdependence exists between three or more partners. Originality/value – This study contributes to existing research on information sharing in supply chains by empirically studying information sharing in an extended supply chain, applying interdependence theory as its analytical framework and unearthing several barriers that are specific to multi-tier information sharing. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84930244749&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-07-2014-0252&partnerID=40&md5=56d0522e6803ca2c1e03025c921ddc7c,Scopus

Dynamic supply chain elements are the transportation agents, who emulate the multi-modal material flows. Intances of transportation agent move material based on the lead times resulting from the transportation's mode attributes and the routes' description. Supply chain participants in SCBB incorporate geographical information to evaluate their behavioural policies for emulating business functions and for communicating with other agents. The use of geographical information enhances the SCBB modelling capabilities by supporting the holistic performance analysis of supply chain designs for the strategic decision-making (e.g. capacity allocation and location decisions), business functions configuration (e.g. management strategies for sourcing, inventory, production and distribution) and phenomena understanding (e.g. complexity management, risk management and green logistics). © 2012 EUROSIS-ETI.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899014140&partnerID=40&md5=c30e3bc51b35c2045aba5d757d95db92,Scopus

In many cases, buyer is prone to use supply chain flexibility rather than inventory holding strategy to withstand demand uncertainty. We assume that the buyer releases a replenishment order to the supplier for each cycle (or period) under the contract which is mainly composed of four parameters: (1) supply cost per unit, (2) minimum order quantity, (3) order quantity reduction penalty and (4) maximum capacity of the supplier. Based on these parameters, there are two flexibility options that buyer should evaluate in the order of cycle (1) issue an order smaller than the minimum order quantity and pay the related penalty and (2) place no order and lose the sales. Hence, Q lost emerges as a critical buyer decision, the order quantity, below which no order is placed. Total expected supply cost plus lost sales, as a function of Q lost is presented. We derive the optimal Q lost that minimises the total cost function. Since capacity of each supplier is finite, we then develop a supplier selection model with total cost minimisation over the suppliers subject to capacity constraint that has a stochastic nature stemming from demand behaviour. Linearisation on the model is performed using chance-constrained programming approach. From a given set of supply bids from the potential supply chain partners, the buyer is able to make a quantifiable choice. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892867377&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-012-1226-5&partnerID=40&md5=38fa218e422ec74eefa1ed220d1d1a6b,Scopus

However, the willingness among shippers to choose flexible transportation services, where the service package can be adapted during planning and execution, has received less attention. In particular, little is known about the contextual circumstances under which shippers would be inclined to select such flexible transportation service. In this study, experimental scenarios and discrete choice modeling are used to investigate the willingness among shippers to use flexible transportation services. We estimate multinomial logit, mixed logit, and latent class models for a sample of nearly 200 global shipper firms and calculate willingness-to-pay measures for flexibility. The findings indicate that flexible services are essential in demand-volatile markets. Since logistics services may provide external flexibility for shipper firms, we also study which related internal flexibilities in supply chains drive these choices.

We consider effectiveness and efficiency of various reactive measures to recover the SC with the minimum cost at the operational level. For this purpose, a new general model based on bounded optimal control theory is developed to determine the type, the extent, and the timing of reactive measures. We demonstrate its application using an example of a two-echelon poultry SC. The intention of the proposed model is to optimise both the recovery and its costs simultaneously. The developed model is solved exactly using the Pontryagin’s maximum principle. We performed a set of sensitivity analyses to illustrate the model's behaviour. The results obtained from applying the dynamic recovery model in the case study show that the proposed model can help SC managers to deal with disruptions by comparing alternative recovery options, based on two important criteria of the time and cost of SC's recovery.

Thus, such systems need to be safeguarded against quality issues and decline in production efficiency to ensure the optimal health of machines. The product quality and health of a reconfigurable manufacturing system can be analyzed by using the diagnosability characteristic. This study examines the diagnosability characteristic in a multi-stage reconfigurable manufacturing system. The aim is to understand the impact of time-based diagnostics on the functionality performance of a reconfigurable manufacturing system and the level of inventory used during production. The diagnosability is analyzed regarding product variation and system diagnosability. A mathematical model is proposed, and it is subsequently applied in deterministic and stochastic settings. The deterministic setting is examined through a set of two problem-specific heuristics. The stochastic setting, subject to the gamma process, is examined by using a simulation-based optimization approach. The results suggest that the use of line replacement units can restore a reconfigurable system to optimal functionality, reduce the level of inventory, and complete production in a minimum time at the expense of additional cost. These findings apply to the context of healthcare emergency response systems, reconfigurable supply chains, reconfigurable integrated manufacturing systems, etc. Finally, a conclusion and future research avenues are provided. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133806504&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2022.3187812&partnerID=40&md5=fc4f6ebdea93f6555f7c3fc1d9d45b71,Scopus

However, limited research has paid attention to study the relationship between SCI, SCF and their impact on supply chain performance (SCP). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to establish a relationship between integration, flexibility and performance. Design/methodology/approach: The structural equation modelling technique was used to analyse the 187 data collected from Indian organisations through the survey methodology. Findings: Findings indicate that external integration contributes significantly to realise SCF and SCP. Sourcing and logistics flexibility also help to improve the SCP. The mediation analysis showed that the association of customer and supplier integration with SCP is partially and fully mediated by logistics flexibility, respectively. This study suggests that integration influences the SCP when the firm has a strong association with downstream partners and enough capability for logistics flexibility. Research limitations/implications: The study has collected cross-sectional data to analyse the relationship between SCI, SCF and SCP. However, as integration requires an effort of the years, longitudinal data and industry-specific studies may provide comprehensive views to validate the results of this study.

As a result, the difference between these two seemingly equal scores has been ignored in previous methods (such as frequency response and moving average). So, the present study constructs a model of Inverse Network Data Envelopment Analysis, to introduce the relative and interval scores of the bullwhip effect magnitude, when a series of uncertain demands are made in a specific time interval. In the first stage of the proposed network, the uncertain demands and the forecasted uncertain data are regarded respectively as the model’s inputs and outputs. These output data constitute the intermediate variables and consequently the inputs of the second stage of the study model. In the second stage, after considering the ordering policies, the uncertain orders are sent. Due to utilizing both the optimistic and pessimistic perspectives, the study methodology includes an interval value for measuring the bullwhip effect with relative attitude. In the optimistic perspective, the analyzed decision making unit has the optimal status in comparison with other decision making units. In the pessimistic perspective, the analyzed decision making unit has the worst status in comparison with other decision making units. The results show that time is an unfair factor in the size of the bullwhip effect. The impact of uncertainties on the bullwhip effect in the demand forecasting stage is greater than the ordering stage. According to the research findings, cross-sectional planning is possible at different times according to different conditions.

Within a supply chain, flexibility levels might differ between stages rendering them appropriate candidates for one approach or the other. The existing approaches, however, require the selection of a single framework for the entire supply chain instead of a stage-wise choice. We develop an integrated hybrid-service (HS) approach which endogenously determines the overall cost-optimal approach for each stage and computes the required inventory levels. We present a dynamic programming optimization algorithm for serial supply chains that partitions the entire system into subchains of different types.

To overcome resulting supply difficulties, innovative multimodal systems via rail terminals are promising options offering the potential to increase buffer capacity, improve supply chain resilience, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, a train terminal is included in a virtual simulation environment spanning the entire wood supply chain from forest to industry to test, analyze, and evaluate a complex multimodal system in different scenario settings. Furthermore, the simulation model provides intuitive decision support through animation and a cockpit of key performance indicators, facilitating hands-on workshops with supply chain managers. Results show the advantage of a combination of unimodal and multimodal transport in the wood supply chain of the observed case-study region. This combination proves to be resilient and outperforms other tested supply chain strategies by avoiding both bottlenecks and ill-timed plans and reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Furthermore, workshops conducted with industry experts indicate that adapting collaborative supply chain control strategies by means of a participatory simulation environment enhances the development of advanced risk management and therefore improves supply chain resilience, efficiency, and sustainability. © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.

As a solution, firms seek flexibility, not only internally but also at the level of their supply chain. To accomplish this, companies invest in information technology (IT), aiming to improve their business processes and collaboration with trading partners. As previous research supports, the use of IT combined with agile supply chain management improves business performance and offers sustainable competitive advantage. However, the extent to which IT enables and supports supply chain flexibility is still debatable and warrants investigation. Although contemporary Internet-based systems (web-based platforms and cloud-based solutions) seem to overcome the rigidity and inflexibility of traditional interorganisational systems (IOS), they are still associated with issues of interoperability and incompatibility. Although they facilitate supply chain collaboration, by providing access to all stakeholders and enabling information-sharing, they may often lead to closed networks of collaboration. To examine these issues, this paper primarily aims to clarify the notion of flexibility at the level of the supply chain. It also aims to contribute to the process by which organisations effectively evaluate and prioritise competing IT investments. Taking into consideration the multidimensional nature of flexibility, this paper proposes a conceptual framework of supply chain flexibility, distinguishing between the operational, structural, and strategic levels of flexibility. It then uses this framework to explain the impact of IT infrastructures (specifically comprising traditional IOS, web-based collaboration platforms and cloud-based solutions) on the various levels of flexibility. Based on previous research, it identifies specific IT characteristics and provides an approach through which practitioners and researchers can compare different technologies and analyse their benefits and limitations, in terms of supply chain flexibility. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055095591&doi=10.1080%2f10919392.2018.1517480&partnerID=40&md5=0238cfba8ed480330eccb8ef10c9ab0b,Scopus

MSC information elicits service details such as locations, specialisations, capacities, certifications, and software and material processing capabilities. Presently, as in the case of web portal-enabled supply chain communications, this information is communicated using models that provide limited semantic precision. These models are also proprietary to specific industry communities; hence, access to MSC information across communities is limited. This article describes deployment of the reference-ontology-based semantic mediation approach using Web Ontology Language (OWL). The mediation introduces shared semantics that enhances access to and precision of proprietary MSC models encoded in relational databases. Detailed deployment steps are discussed using a manufacturing sourcing use case. In the first step, we analyse three alternative conventions for encoding proprietary MSC models into OWL and show that the ontology-oriented encoding convention is most suitable for semantic mediation in OWL. In the deployment step, single- or multi-community deployment is possible. It is shown that the single-community deployment enables precise and greater access to MSC information within the community, while the multi-community deployment additionally enables interoperable access to MSC information across the communities. © This work was authored as part of the Contributors official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

This exchange begins when manufacturers, who hope to join the supply chain, provide the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) with information regarding their production capabilities. These capabilities are represented electronically in what are called manufacturing service capability (MSC) models. These models are frequently proprietary, which makes them difficult to access, and imprecise, which makes them difficult to use. Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a powerful language for capturing the semantics of such models. OWL can enhance both precision and accessibility, but it requires semantic mediation to resolve semantic conflicts and more importantly to enhance model semantics. Semantic-mediation approaches can generally be classified into two approaches mapping-based and reference-ontology-based. This paper characterises and compares the two approaches. Characterisation is based on examples of proprietary MSC models and by deployment criteria including mediation quality, scalability, evolution, and knowledge organisation. Comparison is based on the behaviours and trade-offs of the two approaches in the context of these deployment criteria. The paper also provides a decision-making template associated with these criteria.

Design/methodology/approach: The entire supply chain can be modelled by combining the transfer function into a closed loop system. The transfer function of each entity in the supply chain can be obtained by using the control theory tools. The model can be approximated as a linear discrete system with various operating constants, like lead time, price, order policy and supply. Findings: The continuous replenishment ordering policy for a distribution node in a supply chain was analyzed using the z-transform. Characteristic equations of the closed loop transfer function are obtained. The bullwhip (BW) effect is analyzed. Study proves that the BW effect is in evitable if the standard heuristic ordering policy is employed with demand forecasting; also the paper analysed price supply trade-off for dynamic demand and supply.

The entire supply chain can be modelled by combining the transfer function into a closed-loop system. The transfer function of each entity in the supply chain can be obtained by using the control theory tools. The model can be approximated as a linear discrete system with various operating constants, like lead time, price, order policy and supply. The stability (sustainability) of the system can be analysed using the closed-loop transfer function. Different control strategy can be designed using frequency domain analysis. Bullwhip effect is controlled in an effective manner using different control strategy. This model will be helpful in developing an automated smart supply chain system, incorporating the effect of price change and other wide sense stationary random variables in the supply chain system. The objective of this work is to develop a model that can be used for decision support for control of different parameters including price, subject to different control strategies.

This pandemic can be compared to past earthquakes and tsunamis, as the coronavirus is also a natural disaster. Due to these past disruptions, organizations have taken many precautions and developed risk mitigation strategies to manage them. Because the COVID-19 outbreak shows the importance of new business perspectives like repurposing a viability strategy, that comes with sustainability and reconfigurability. Where reconfiguration focuses on adaptation, which directly means changes in resources and capabilities and repurposing focuses on a quick response solution to address the shortage. In this paper, a study has been done in two phases to model viability in an automobile supply chain during the COVID-19 times. In the first phase, a hybrid Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach is used to get the best criteria and alternatives with sustainability and reconfigurability under consideration. The multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) model has been developed in the second phase. Suppliers' weight that is obtained will be used to get the optimal order and allocation. This model will help develop supply chain strategies to cope with situations that hinder the firm's competitiveness.

An well-ordered and flexible supply chain allows the firm to choose the correct suppliers at the right time for the right kind of materials, with reduced purchase cost, thereby improving competitiveness. Supply chains have the basic characteristics like multiple conflicting criteria, demand uncertainties, lead time and delivery uncertainties. In the literature isolated studies on supplier selection using mathematical models, multiple criteria decision making techniques and multiple stakeholder requirements are commonly found. Integration of these aspects give promising results. The correlated Analytic Hierarchy (CAHP) considers the correlation effect between criteria in the Analytic Hierarchy process. Linear physical programming (LPP) is a multi-objective optimization method that develops an aggregate objective function of the criteria in a piecewise, goal-programming fashion. LPP model enables decision maker to think about multiple criteria (i.e., cost, customer service, and rejections) and to express criteria preferences in terms of degrees of desirability. This paper proposes an integrated method for dealing with such problems using correlated Analytic Hierarchy- and linear physical programming techniques. The method proposed demonstrates selection of appropriate suppliers and allocates orders optimally among them.finally model calculation is presented. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, an understanding of international logistics risks, or causes of failure, how these may interact with each other and how they can be mitigated are imperatives for the smooth operation of international supply chains. The purpose of this paper is to specifically investigate the interactions between international logistics risks within the prevailing structures of international supply chains and highlights how these risks may be inter-connected and amplified. A new dynamic supply chain logistics risk analysis model is proposed which is novel as it provides a holistic understanding of the risk event interactivity. Design/methodology/approach: The paper applies interpretive structural modelling to data collected from a survey of leading supply chain practitioners, in order to analyse their perspectives of risk elements and interactions. The risk elements and their contextual relationship were derived empirically through the use of focus groups and subsequent Delphi study. The two stages of the research rely on experts’ views on risk events and clusters and the level of interactions among those clusters. Findings: A key finding of this research is that supply chain practitioner’s perception of risk consists of inter-connected four levels: value streams risks; information and relationship risks; risks in international supply chain activities; and external environment. In particular, since level 2 risk creates feedback loops of risks, risk management at level 2 can dampen the amplification effect and the strength of the interactions. Practical implications: Several managerial implications are drawn. First, the research guides managers in the identification and evaluation of risk events which can impact the performance of their international logistics supply chain operations. Second, evidence is presented that supports the proposition that the relationships with trading partners and LSPs, and the degree of logistics information exchange, are critical to prevent, or at least mitigate, logistics risks which can substantially affect the responsiveness of the international supply chain. Originality/value: The main contribution to knowledge that this study offers to the literature on supply chain risk management is the development of a supply chain logistics risk analysis model which includes both risk elements and interactions.

Accordingly, supply chain managers are viewing the DSC as a critical source of value creation and competitive advantage. Yet, many firms are still in the early stages of adoption and there is a lack of understanding of how the DSC can develop supply chain capabilities or improve supply chain performance. The DSC concept has not yet been appropriately theoretically grounded. Drawing on dynamic capabilities and ambidexterity, we present a set of six propositions showing how digital ambidexterity can be achieved to generate high levels of supply chain performance. We introduce a conceptual framework that underlines the importance of dynamic supply chain capabilities, including visibility, agility, and flexibility, in the design of the DSC-building process. We highlight the need to possess these capabilities to create ambidextrous supply chain capabilities.

Historically, medical device manufacturers have selected one of the available industrial sterilization options: dry heat, moist heat, gamma, or ethylene oxide (EO). The preselection of a sterilization modality (method) typically is made without understanding its impact based on qualified sterilization processes for existing products, capability, or resources required for the specific processes. Early engagement with sterilization subject matter experts (SMEs) can redirect the decision to preselect a legacy modality and help foster innovation and operational agility. Recent focus on supply chain flexibility and sustainability by the medical device industry has been affected by concerns surrounding cobalt-60 shortages and EO emissions.

In such a case, it can be argued that the inbound vehicle routing schedule should be combined with incoming parts inventory control. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous control method of combining vehicle scheduling and inventory control for such dynamic inbound logistics. For the transportation control, a vehicle routing system, in which delivery jobs are made with shipments of one supplier, is proposed to generate a vehicle routes plan by considering production start time, travel time, waiting time, and loading/unloading time. To evaluate the performance of the generated vehicle routing plan, a goal model is also developed by considering vehicle operating cost, stock level exceeding penalty, and transportation efficiency. A generated vehicle routing plan can be rejected when the stock level is over the capacity and an appropriate number of vehicles for its manufacturing environment can be determined. Using real data from an LCD firm, a simulation study is conducted. The simulation results indicate that the simultaneous control approach requires fewer vehicles than the existing system and shows better efficiency of transportation. This method can also be used to determine the appropriate incoming part inventory level or the number of vehicles required in dynamic inbound logistics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901794289&doi=10.1016%2fj.compind.2014.03.001&partnerID=40&md5=3050d3ca18f294e28f48911aec52adb8,Scopus

Agility is an essential ability for firms facing such an environment. However, coping with the hostile business environment requires not only the agility from individual firms but also the collaboration from their supply chain partners. Supply chain agility (SCA) therefore is vital to the competitiveness and performance of a firm and its supply chain partners. Exploring how to effectively enable SCA is significant for both practice and theory development. Recently, firms are increasingly relying on integrated information systems and analytical tools, such as business intelligent systems, and close collaboration with their supplier chain partners to enhance their responsiveness. This paper seeks to broaden the understanding about the enabling roles of IOS integration, analytical ability of inter-organizational information systems (IOS), and supply chain flexibility on SCA based on the dynamic capabilities view and real options theory. With a sample of 147 matched-pair data gathered from the top 2000 Taiwanese manufacturing firms, our results support the effect of IOS integration on supply chain flexibility, including offering and sourcing flexibilities, which in turn facilitate SCA. We also propose and show the moderating effect of analytical ability of IOS on the process of enabling SCA.

In order to effectively respond to this uncertain business environment, individual companies and parts of supply chains need flexibility, and this need for dynamic flexibility is growing as uncertainty increases. In this study, we tested our hypothesis using structural equation model analysis to verify the structural relationship between dynamic capability and business performance in the smart supply chain environment of Korean small and medium manufacturers. We confirmed through this that dynamic capability and environmental uncertainty in a smart supply chain environment have a partially significant effect on business performance and that manufacturers must strive to implement direct, systematic policies and improve dynamic capability to respond to an uncertain business environment. © 2021 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105097164&doi=10.1109%2fSNPDWinter52325.2021.00066&partnerID=40&md5=8049874067544be818f04e522caa33d8,Scopus

Identifying those risks, assessing the probability of those risks, and understanding how those risks change if mitigation strategies are implemented contribute to better supply chain risk management. Reliability analysis has a long tradition of assessing the probability of failure, and fault trees are typically used to understand how the failure of individual components can lead to system failure within an engineered system. More recently, fault trees have been proposed to assess the probability of a supply chain failure. Dynamic fault trees, which are relatively new in reliability analysis, model the dependency among possible component failure and how these probabilities change over time. This paper applies dynamic fault trees to model supply chain risk for different types of supply chains. The dynamic fault tree allows a firm to model complex interactions among suppliers and understand how those interactions impact its risk. The model incorporates an information system that relays information about the status of suppliers to the firm, and this information system could also fail. A Markov chain model and Monte Carlo simulation are used to numerically assess supply chain risk as modeled by these dynamic fault trees. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072775330&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2019.106061&partnerID=40&md5=f68b3c1ce2ea2fd4e4422dcf13486606,Scopus

The achievement of these objectives implies new relations, innovative processes and new modes of evaluation between supply chain stakeholders. These pressures have prompted academics and industrial leaders to investigate new methods in order to achieve effectiveness across the fashion supply chain. As such, the concepts of agile supply chain, flexible systems, and quick response have emerged and have been adopted in several ways in the industry. Despite their recognition, these concepts are often confused in the literature. To avoid those issues, this paper aims at proposing a formal analysis framework, called ASO, for conducting a literature review of the agility initiatives and models developed for the fashion industry.

It is one of essential features that affect the results of the functioning of a supply chain. Many researchers indicate adaptability as a significant source of acquiring and maintaining a long-term competitive advantage, one of major factors that guarantee the success of a supply chain, or a major development megatrend of supply chains. The main objective of the article is to analyse the impact of such factors as industry and applied competitive strategy (cost leadership, differentiation, or focus) on the level of supply chain performance and results achieved by the supply chain with regard to the key aspects of performance in the context of adaptability. Methods: In the article the author analyses results of studies conducted with CATI method at a sample of 200 enterprises representing four industries: automotive, food, furniture as well as consumer electronics and household appliances, which are among most advanced sectors in the Polish economy (leaders of Polish export). The analysis of data gathered was carried out at a few stages. Firstly, a hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis was applied. The developed model was used for measuring and assessing the performance of supply chains and its dimensions by means of designating factor scores. The last stage involved studying the impact of such factors as type of industry or applied competitive strategy on the level of performance and its four dimensions: visibility, velocity, versatility, and responsiveness. At this stage the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Results: The results of the conducted studies provided evidence that the level of supply chain performance as well as its four dimensions is not affected by the type of industry, but vary in accordance to the applied competitive strategy. Conclusions: The model, developed and positively verified in terms of quality, may constitute a useful tool for management practitioners to measure and assesses the performance of specific supply chains, as well as make comparisons between them. Thanks to determining factors that affect the level of performance and its four dimensions, managers may as well consciously indicate directions in improving supply chains. ©Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104736619&doi=10.17270%2fJ.LOG.2021.584&partnerID=40&md5=54276a6c1664cbabdcff680aa014a91f,Scopus

Since the origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains open.

The manufacturer's second-period production cost declines linearly in the first-period production, but with a random learning rate. The manufacturer may or may not have the inventory carryover option. We formulate the resulting problems as two-period Stackelberg games and obtain their feedback equilibrium solutions explicitly. We then examine the impact of mean learning rate and learning rate variability on the pricing strategies of the channel members, on the manufacturer's production decisions, and on the retailer's procurement decisions. We show that as the mean learning rate or the learning rate variability increases, the traditional double marginalization problem becomes more severe, leading to greater efficiency loss in the channel. We obtain revenue sharing contracts that can coordinate the dynamic supply chain. In particular, when the manufacturer may hold inventory, we identify two major drivers for inventory carryover: market growth and learning rate variability.

(ii) Considering the climate-water-land nexus, is there a risk of shifting impacts from climate to water scarcity and land occupation, and what are the key opportunities for impact mitigation? Methods: A framework for conducting a large-scale regionalised LCA was developed and applied to compare the environmental impacts of 212 plant-based fat spreads, 16 plant-based creams and 40 dairy alternatives sold in 21 countries per 1 kg of product. Data was compiled for different product recipes, key ingredient sourcing countries, production factory locations, energy mixes, packaging designs, transportation and end-of-life scenarios. Spatially (archetype) differentiated agricultural life cycle inventory data were generated, as well as LUC emissions for agricultural ingredients. A total of 18 environmental indicators were assessed. Results and discussion: All plant-based spreads had a significantly lower climate impact than butter, with and without LUC inclusion. The regionalised analysis highlighted large variabilities across products, ranging from 0.98 to 6.93 (mean 3.3) kg CO2-eq for 212 plant-based spreads and 8.08 to 16.93 (mean 12.1) kg CO2-eq for 21 dairy butter with 95th confidence interval. The main drivers of GHG emissions for plant-based products are oilseed farming and the associated LUC emissions, which can vary significantly depending on type of oilseeds, quantity and sourcing country; in the worst-case scenario, the climate advantage is no longer valid due to LUC. Thus, the inclusion of LUC is essential for a robust assessment and hotspot identification. Overall, the risk of shifting impact was small, as most of the plant-based spreads also had lower impacts for water scarcity footprints and land occupation; 8 of the 212 products were not lower, due to oilseed ingredients with high embodied impacts. Conclusions: This study confirmed that plant-based spreads had lower climate, water and land impacts than butter, despite variability of product recipes, geographies and influence of LUC. This research offers a framework for performing regionalised agricultural LCA for a large portfolio of products thereby enabling identification of inter-product variabilities and hotspots for the development of mitigation strategies. Key mitigation opportunities include reducing oilseed ingredients’ embodied impacts by optimising product recipe design and adapting supply chain sourcing and agricultural practice. © 2020, The Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078054313&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-019-01703-w&partnerID=40&md5=812caa43dabcc4c92e36d2b50473d5b0,Scopus

These strategic-focused models do not consider the supply chain's agility, i.e., its ability to quickly respond to unexpected fluctuations in customer needs. In this paper, we study the problem of designing a supply chain distribution network under demand uncertainty and analyze how the optimal design characteristics of proximity and agility depend on various input parameters. We are able to draw managerial insights on how agility considerations may invalidate well-established and widely accepted qualitative results derived from traditional models. In particular,we showthat it is optimal to increase the density of distribution centers (DCs) when the shortage penalty cost increases, and to decrease the density of DCs when a certain unit transportation cost parameter increases.

Engaging suppliers and customers on carbon management reduces vulnerability to climate-related risks and increases resilience and adaptability in supply chains. Therefore, it is important to understand the motives and preconditions for pursuing supply chain engagement from companies that actively engage with supply chain members in carbon management. In this study, a relational view is applied to operationalize the supply chain engagement concept to reflect the different levels of supplier and customer engagement. Based on a sample of 345 companies from the Carbon Disclosure Project’s supply chain program, the determinants of engagement were hypothesized and tested using multinomial and ordinal logistic estimation methods. The results indicate that companies that integrate climate change into their strategies and are involved in developing environmental public policy are driven by moral motives to engage their suppliers and customers in carbon management. All these factors make a stronger impact on supplier engagement than on customer engagement. Moreover, companies operating in greenhouse gas-intensive industries are driven by instrumental motives to engage their suppliers and customers because increasing greenhouse gas intensity positively influences engagement level. Company profitability appears to increase supplier engagement, but not customer engagement. Interestingly, operating in a country with stringent environmental regulations does not appear to influence supply chain engagement. By utilizing relational capabilities and collaboration, buyers can increase their suppliers’ engagement to disclose emissions, which ultimately will lead to better results in carbon management. © 2022, The Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134307582&doi=10.1007%2fs10551-022-05199-7&partnerID=40&md5=f87174a6e8450515939c281ffcfb16cb,Scopus

To address this challenge effectively, this study firstly proposes a resource evaluation method from a dynamic and integration process-oriented perspective. It then elaborates the impacts of service firm's strategic renewals, as well as the operational decisions, namely the resource scheduling decisions, on the evolution of the resource's integration value. On this basis, it illustrates the mechanism of the dynamic SCI optimization in SMC, and further designs a novel SCI optimization model along with a corresponding genetic algorithm. In particular, tradeoff between customized demands and scale effects, which is the paradox of SMC, is regarded as an essential optimization objective besides SCI performance. The feasibility and validity of the model and algorithm are verified by applying them to a numerical example. By incorporating the perspective of service operations, strategic change and the methodology of operations research, this study contributes to the literature of SCI in SMC by developing a dynamic resource evaluation method and a novel optimization model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045580583&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2018.04.018&partnerID=40&md5=a81326e231589efba2abb66e6a5ffe42,Scopus

This paper presents a cooperative stochastic differential game model to research the optimal coordination strategy of a dynamic supply chain under uncertain conditions and studies how to coordinate the effort level of node enterprise to maximize supply chain profit. For this purpose, a cooperative stochastic differential game model of the enterprises’ effort level is constructed, and the optimal solution of the model is solved by converting it to the solution of the equivalent stochastic partial differential equation. As a result, the optimal strategy of a local node enterprise is achieved. Considering the gap between the independent decision of each node enterprise and the optimal decision of the supply chain system, the coordination mechanisms of the dynamic supply chain, including the temporary static allocation mechanism and the compensation mechanism, are given to narrow the gap to achieve the optimal coordination strategy under uncertain conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85005925775&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2016.10.011&partnerID=40&md5=c94c23e3a86a42d20555e551cde357c6,Scopus

The objective of this study is to investigate the impacts of myopic behaviour regarding the reference quality on the product quality and pricing strategies and profits of both members. Our results suggest that the manufacturers myopia leads to a higher quality, higher price strategy and a higher quality-price ratio which benefits consumers. Meanwhile, relative to the far-sighted behaviour, myopia results in a more quality-sensitive but less price-sensitive market demand. Whats more, we find that the manufacturer is apt to act in a far-sighted way, but the retailer isnt always willing to cooperate with a far-sighted manufacturer.

Mobility restriction and overall demand decline lead to systematically cascading disruptions that are more severe and longer lasting than those caused by natural disasters and political conflicts. In the present study, the authors find that large companies and manufacturers with traditional advantages suffer greater losses than small ones, which is conceptualized as the “Hub Paradox” by empirically investigating one Warp Knitting Industrial Zone of China. An underload cascading failure model is employed to simulate supply chain viability under disruptions. Numerical simulations demonstrate that when the load decreases beyond a threshold, the viability will drop down critically. Besides, supply chain viability depends on two aspects: the adaptive capability of the manufacturers themselves and the adaptive capability of the connections of the supply network. The comparison study demonstrates that enhancing cooperative relations between hub and non-hub manufacturers will facilitate the entire supply network viability. The present study sheds light on viable supply chain management. Compared with conventionally linear or resilient supply chains, intertwined supply networks can leverage viability with higher adaptation of redistributing production capacities among manufacturers to re-establish overall scale advantages. Finally, the present study also suggests solving the “Hub Paradox” from the perspective of complex adaptive system. © 2022, The Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136540588&doi=10.1007%2fs11071-022-07741-8&partnerID=40&md5=69675132fd4954803944b76d6acebf23,Scopus

More importantly, it examines whether this relationship between SCCs and GO is contingent on corporate environmental proactivity (EP). Theoretical predictions of the conceptual model were tested using hierarchical regression analyses of data obtained from 225 senior logistics/supply chain managers in the global auto sector. To ensure the robustness of our findings, a post-hoc analysis using the partial least squares approach was conducted. Significant positive associations exist between specific SCCs and the adoption of GO strategies. EP positively moderates the external integration capability – green purchasing and the supplier appraisal capability – green manufacturing linkages. However, unexpectedly, EP negatively moderates the effect of internal integration capability on green purchasing. Equally surprising, consistent negative moderation effects are detected for supply chain flexibility on green design, green purchasing, and green manufacturing. This study contributes to the existing resource-based view literature by focusing on the capability – strategy linkage and its specific application to environmental management.

Data that were collected from 225 senior logistics/supply chain managers across the automotive OEM and supplier base (predominantly from China, North America and Europe) were analyzed using moderated regression analyses. Findings – SCCs contribute to effective green strategy implementation and their magnitude varies significantly with respect to green design, green purchasing and green manufacturing.

The model allows us to investigate the interplay of the heterogeneous decision-makers in the supply chain in a dynamic setting, and to compute the resultant equilibrium pattern of product outputs, transactions, inventories, and product prices. We then establish the supernetwork equivalence of the multiperiod supply chain model with a properly configured transportation network, which provides a new interpretation of the equilibrium conditions of the former in terms of paths and path flows.

However, it lacks an acceptable generic standard. Supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model is a cross-functional framework widely accepted as an industry standard. It provides the standard processes, performance metrics, best practices and associated software functionalities for modelling, evaluating and improving supply chain networks. However, it is a static tool. Integration of agent-based distributed simulation and SCOR model can exploit their advantages to form a generic methodology for modelling and simulation of a wide range of supply chain networks. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology for distributed supply chain network modelling and simulation by means of integration of agent-based distributed simulation and an improved SCOR model. The methodology contains two components: a hierarchical framework for modelling supply chain network based on the improved SCOR model and agent building blocks integrating the standard processes from the SCOR model. The hierarchical framework provides an approach for structure modelling in any level with different granularities based on the improved SCOR model, and allows rapidly mapping a supply chain network into the structure model of a multi-agent system; while agent building blocks are quite useful and convenient to fill the structure model to fulfil its function modelling. With the approach of structure modelling and function filling, not only can the process of agent-based supply chain network modelling be accelerated, but also the built models can be reused and expanded. Because the hierarchical framework is based on the conceptual framework of SCOR model and agent building blocks integrate the standard processes from SCOR model, the proposed methodology is more generic. In addition, the issues of sub-model synchronisation and data distribution management in the agent-based distributed simulation implementation are taken into consideration and the corresponding solutions for these issues are proposed. Finally, an example of a supply chain network is modelled and implemented to illustrate the proposed methodology and related solutions. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908606602&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2014.910623&partnerID=40&md5=9643d4a5b855caadb7262c096f9a3658,Scopus

Although structural design methods have been proposed to create supply networks with optimal robustness, a real-life supply network can be quite different from these optimal structural designs. Meanwhile, real cases such as Thailand floods and Tohoku earthquake demonstrate the vulnerability of supply networks in real life. Obviously, it is urgent to enhance the robustness of existing real-life supply networks. Thus, in this paper, a supply network reconfiguration method based on adaptive variable neighborhood search (AVNS) is proposed to enhance the structural robustness of supply networks facing both random and target disruptions. Firstly, a supply network model considering the heterogeneous roles of entities is introduced. Based on the model, two robustness metrics, Rr and Rt, are proposed to describe the tolerance of supply networks facing random and target disruptions, respectively. Then, the problem of reconfiguration-based supply network robustness enhancement is described. To solve the problem effectively and efficiently, a new heuristic based on general variable neighborhood search, namely, AVNS, is proposed. Finally, a case study based on three real-life supply networks is presented to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed robustness enhancing method. © 2020 Ping Lou et al.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098193350&doi=10.1155%2f2020%2f1292938&partnerID=40&md5=b7828671bdf828bafc2667004a21fab0,Scopus

The purpose of this study is to compare and analyze the dynamic effects of different subsidy policies to the manufacturer in a green supply chain composed of a manufacturer and a retailer. Three differential game models, considering the consumers preference, are established under three subsidy policies, and the corresponding optimal equilibrium strategies of the supply chain members are analyzed. An exam-ple is used to compare the effects of the three policies under the equal government subsidy expendi-ture. The study finds that the rankings of indexes to evaluate steady‐state subsidy effects under the different subsidy policies are time invariant, and the government can preliminarily evaluate these policies according to different subsidy goals. The rankings of indexes to evaluate phased subsidy effects under these policies are time varying. If both subsidy effects and subsidy efficiencies in steady state are taken into account, the optimal selection paths of subsidy policies in the whole period can be obtained.

Design/methodology/approach - The two asymmetry hypotheses have been tested with survey data from 212 Chinese manufacturing firms. Findings - The results in general provided empirical evidences for the asymmetric effects in the fits and misfits between environmental uncertainty and supply chain flexibility. For the same degree of misfit, underfit deteriorates performance more than overfit. In addition, high supply chain flexibility fitting high environmental uncertainty (i.e. high-high fit) results in a higher performance than low supply chain flexibility fitting low environmental uncertainty (i.e. low-low fit). Practical implications - It suggests that managers should strive to avoid the underfit of supply chain flexibility rather than the overfit, if the perfect fit is impossible to achieve.

Otherwise, supply chain flexibility evaluation is a typical multiobjective evaluation; there are some incompatibilities between these flexible evaluation indicators, and the common evaluation methods are difficult to deal with such contradictions.

Two dynamic Stackelberg game models have been built involving both a manufacturer and a retailer assumed to be the leader in order. In the two models, the manufacturer sells national-brand (NB) product to an independent retailer or directly to consumers through a direct channel. The retailers sell a store-brand (SB) product when they sell the NB product coming from the manufacturer. Thus, there is competition both in different channels and in products with different brands. To analyze the complexity of the model, parameter bifurcation diagrams and strange attractor diagrams have been therefore plotted. The results show that the game leader has advantages when the market is stable, but it turns disadvantageous if the state falls into unstable as the game follower can quickly adjust the strategy to seize the market. The wholesale price and the direct selling price are high that they incur larger profits if the manufacturer is dominant, but it gets worse when the adjustment speed increases. While in the model where the retailer plays a dominant role, the increase in the adjustment speed is unfavorable to retailer. By controlling the total cost of the direct channel and increasing channel competition strength and brand competition strength, the manufacturers can increase their profits in the game dominated by the retailer. In addition, the stable region within the system will be narrow since the market is sensitive to the channel competition, brand competition, and advertising indifference. © 2019 Junhai Ma et al.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081680039&doi=10.1155%2f2019%2f4802360&partnerID=40&md5=93c830f221e9eb0e79e96802d07ace08,Scopus

Cooperative (Co-op) advertising is a widely used marketing tool which affects advertising effort policy and advertising subsidy policy throughout the supply chain. First, the manufacturer announces the participation rate of cooperative advertising which specifies the percentage of the retailer's advertising expenditure that it will provide, then the retailer determines its advertising effort policy. We model this supply chain problem as a Stackelberg differential game, and provide the optimal advertising effort policy and advertising subsidy policy for the manufacturer and the retailer. Based on a Co-op advertising scenarios, we consider the supply disruption. When a supply disruption occurs, the initial cooperative advertising policy need to be revised. To solve this problem, the change of margin of manufacturer and retailer and market scale of product caused by supply disruption must be explicitly considered. This paper discusses how to model the supply disruptions and their impacts, and how to design cooperative advertising scheme under supply disruption. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

The e-commerce platform provides real-time communication services for buyers and sellers. Different buyers and sellers form crossnetwork characteristics. The formulation and implementation of bilateral strategies affect both the merchants and consumers' choice of platform and registration transactions. This impact will directly lead to the transaction value of the platform. Then, the article builds an econometric model and empirically analyses the impact of e-commerce platforms. The e-commerce chain is a complex structure that consists of logistics, information flow, and capital flow and connects suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and users in the industry together. Blockchain technology can be used as a large-scale collaboration tool to adapt to supply chain management, the main factor that drives the market power of the enterprise. The research results show that the input costs of advertising, research and development, and employee training and the impact of long-term investment and taxation on market forces are quite different in different industries, both positive and negative, and subsidies, inventory, and state-owned holdings have a negative impact on the market power of companies in all industries. Finally, the competition strategy of e-commerce platform enterprises is summarized.

Extant research highlights the importance of system states–namely robustness and resilience–towards mitigating the probability and magnitude of disruptions, however, there appears to be a lack of conceptual guidance surrounding two popular strategies–redundancy and flexibility–that have been proposed to mitigate the impact of disruptions. To address this issue, we review and investigate contextual factors from empirical research that may offer insight into conceptual strategies that can be utilised to improve post-disruption system performance utilising a methodology based upon an abductive approach to conceptual theory building. In this paper published research on resilience and robustness in supply chains is considered, alongside research in other areas such as risk, systems theory, and ecology. Inference drawn from empirical research is often highly contextualised, but collectively highlights unique generalisable factors. Our research proposes four broad conceptual strategies–insurance, expediting, strategic adaptive capability and reconfiguration–that each uniquely serve to reduce the probability and magnitude of supply chain disruptions. Our research concludes that the difference in utility between redundancy and flexibility as means to enhance resilience and robustness is influenced by interactions between the supply chain, the disruption characteristics (inclusive of speed of onset and time horizon) and the decision maker. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075717805&doi=10.1080%2f13669877.2019.1694964&partnerID=40&md5=e4a4e8ebc9bd3947d5181fe1beead9ee,Scopus

While these approaches in general prove to solve the disruption problem, they come with a negative effect on cost per product and cost of capital. In a highly volatile demand environment with fast pace changing technology, increasing inventory can constitute a big risk for obsolesce, hence additional measures are needed to create a competitive business advantage with such a supply chain. Furthermore, when competing about the same sources, as in the case of semiconductors, Operations Executives need to be able to respond fast when supply issues occur, in order to minimize the potential impact from a disruption. The ability to react and response to a disruption is enhanced with Supply chain risk tools utilizing the most recent technologies, such as Control Tower solutions enabling End-to End monitoring and transparency. However, even with the help of such technology, the decision maker will still be reactive and can merely respond to occurrences. To reach the next level of responsiveness, additional layer of intelligence is needed in the supply chain solution. From the available literature about Supply Chain Resilience, and similar advanced supply chain solutions, we can conclude that the main focus of research has so far been on the demand side, i.e., how to enhance forecast management. There are thus few practical and academic contributions on how to manage the supply side or more precise on how to manage the Inbound Supply Chain in a volatile business environment.

Aim of this paper is to analyze the applications of this technology on supply chains, investigate how it affects the structure and characteristics of the traditional supply chain, and finally, develop a business model for its optimal use, through the case study of the LEAP-1A jet engine fuel nozzle supply chain. This was achieved in three steps. First, current literature was reviewed, to fully understand the technology, its applications and the production processes it affects. Second, three different supply chain scenarios, i.e. conventional supply chain, centralized 3D printing and decentralized 3D printing were developed and elaborated, so as to allow the easier identification of the differences of the supply chain processes among the scenarios. To select the most effective scenario, an online survey with the participation of experts was conducted, to attribute weights to indicators identified through the literature review. Finally, a business model for the chosen scenario was developed using the Business Model Canvas. The analysis and evaluation of the indicators revealed that the most effective supply chain model is a decentralized additive manufacturing model.

The socioeconomic and environmental benefits of replacing fossil fuels with bioenergy are complex; however, debate continues about issues such as best practices for biomass removal, stable supply chains, and GHG mitigation. With the greatest biomass per capita in the world, Canada could play an increasing role in the future of global bioenergy and the emerging bioeconomy. This paper reviews the utilization of feedstock salvaged after natural disturbances (fire and insect outbreaks) to supply wood-based bioenergy, by addressing the following multidisciplinary questions: (1) How much salvaged feedstock is available, and what are the uncertainties around these estimates? (2) How can sustainable practices to support increased removal of biomass be implemented? (3) What are the constraints on development of an integrated supply chain and cost-effective mobilization of the biomass? (4) Is the quality of biomass from salvaged trees suitable for conversion to bioenergy? (5) What is the potential for climate change mitigation? In average, salvaged feedstock from fire and insects could theoretically provide about 100 × 106 oven Dry ton (ODT) biomass per year, with high variability over time and space. Existing policies and guidelines for harvesting of woody biomass in Canadian jurisdictions could support sustainable biomass removal. However, uncertainties remain as to the development of competitive and profitable supply chains, because of the large distances between the locations of this feedstock and available processing sites. Another uncertainty lies in the time needed for a benefit in climate change mitigation to occur. A flexible supply chain, integrated with other sources of biomass residues, is needed to develop a cost-efficient bioenergy sector.

Telephone surveys using a computerized system have been used to collect data, obtaining a response rate of 15.6 and a structural equation model has been designed to test the six proposed hypotheses. Findings: Companies initially implement Lean Production to optimize Mass Personalization processes and improve business performance. However, in the presence of Supply Chain Flexibility, Lean Production implementation no longer has a direct impact on Mass Personalization and business performance, but it does have an indirect impact through the flexibility it achieves (shown as a total mediating path). Therefore, companies should implement Lean Production to achieve flexibility and thus optimize the Mass Personalization processes and obtain better performance. Originality/value: Academics and business managers may have supporting evidence on the role played by the total mediating effect of Supply Chain Flexibility on the relationship between Lean Production, Mass Personalization and business performance. A better knowledge of these management resources and their relationship could affect the way researchers and practitioners approach them, becoming more aware of the important role of the supply chain in competitiveness. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097273229&doi=10.1108%2fSCM-02-2020-0083&partnerID=40&md5=c17d800df813cc1ac477c7bf8ed44fbb,Scopus

Thus, sales forecasting is crucial to maintain competitiveness in the retail segment, but obtaining inaccurate forecasts can lead to stock shortages, causing delays in deliveries and generating customer dissatisfaction, as well as increasing inventory, increasing the cost of warehousing, forcing the “burn” of stock through promotional campaigns, directly affecting profitability. Forecasting the demand for products and services and adapting the supply chain by finding a balance has always been and will continue to be a challenge in the retail segment. This research aims to evaluate the main methods and identify the one with the greatest accuracy in sales prediction. Based on an integrative literature review (ILR), three main methods were evaluated: time series, artificial neural networks and machine learning algorithms. The results show that machine learning is more suitable in terms of accuracy, particularly when models contain exogenous and endogenous variables, in addition to allowing the identification of hidden patterns in demand that can be used to identify market trends. However, in markets with constant demands and few external interferences, its use is not justified because, for these cases, the use of time series is simpler and less costly. © 2022 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

In terms of methodology, this article is based on the analysis of secondary data from two housing reconstruction projects. Findings indicate that the use of local resources in humanitarian aid has positive effects on programs' overall supply chain performance and these effects are not only related to the macroeconomic perspective, but benefits expand to improvements related to the use of knowledge. At the same time, it was found that local sourcing often comes with a number of problems. For example, in one of the cases, significant problems existed, which were related to the scarcity of local supplies.

The resulting model, MultiGAP, addresses the assignment of tasks to agents within each time period, with the attendant single-period assignment costs and agent-capacity constraint requirements, in conjunction with transition costs arising between any two consecutive periods in which a task is reassigned to a different agent. As is the case for its single-period antecedent, MultiGAP offers a robust tool for modeling a wide range of capacity planning problems occurring within supply chain management. We provide two formulations for MultiGAP and establish that the second (alternative) formulation provides a tighter bound. We define a Lagrangian relaxation-based heuristic as well as a branch-and-bound algorithm for MultiGAP. Computational experience with the heuristic and branch-and-bound algorithm on over 2500 test problems is reported. The Lagrangian heuristic consistently generates high-quality and in many cases near-optimal solutions.

As lack of transparency in global supply chains is a major risk for sustainability, blockchain offers an attractive solution in the form of a reliable platform to create transparency and risk management. Not considering the nascent stage of the technology, companies are investing millions of dollars into blockchain solutions for many business problems including that of supply chains. However, blockchain-enabled networkwide transparency and visibility also inject new dynamics into supply chains through introduction of structural changes like redefining what is organizational boundary, creating new resources, and a new transactional economy for supply chain management. The structural changes also create a fundamental need for organizations in a supply network to adapt their supply chain processes to this new and emerging supply chain structural dynamics for organizational and network-level efficiency and sustainability. For efficient restructuring of the supply chain processes, organizations need clarity regarding what should be the focus of their processes for creating sources of competitive advantage. Using topic modeling, a text mining technique, this work finds the focus areas of supply chain processes in organizations with examples of successful application of blockchain technology. Apart from how these organizations have integrated the strengths of blockchain in their supply chain processes, we also provide an exhaustive theoretical explanation about how firms can create sources of competitive advantage from blockchain technology.

On-site concrete formwork reuse contributes to cost savings and material waste reduction. However, concrete formwork reuse among different construction sites is still limited. In addition, on-site formwork planning is inherently complicated, and dynamic processes of formwork reuse increase the complexity since on-site emergencies result in various changes. This study aims to provide an appropriate approach to analyze the dynamic processes of formwork reuse among construction sites, for minimizing both the total cost of each site and the overall formwork consumptions. A mathematical model is first developed to analyze formwork utilization on a single site, and an agent-based model is then proposed along with discrete events to implement and simulate formwork reuse with dynamic changes among construction sites configuring a supply chain. The mathematical model minimizing the total cost of concrete formwork enables the understanding of decisions and behaviors of a single construction site and provides a basis for simulation modeling. In the agent-based model, four major decision agents consisting of construction sites, commercial formwork suppliers, waste disposal centers, and transportation trucks are developed. Considering asymmetric information, a negotiation protocol is integrated into agents’ behaviors to facilitate interactions. With the agent-based modeling and simulation, the optimal strategies for construction sites to reuse formwork can be generated. The results of a case study indicate that formwork reuse in the supply chain can outperform that on a single site and results in a cost saving of 25.38%, a quantity reduction of 33.56%, and a surplus reuse value reduction of 73.18%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121273697&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2021.130038&partnerID=40&md5=8d4992256eb7396b7af623dff459d841,Scopus

The disruption brought by the pandemic has highlighted the relevance of responsiveness and agility in service chains in particular. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic, however, has made design of agile and responsive supply chains difficult, especially for services that draw on intangible, unique resources. In this paper, we develop relevant—and thus far largely absent—theory for the design of service supply chains through a model of service supply chain fit that will guide service firms to prepare better for COVID and future threats. Our model guides the identification of the right supply chain (responsive, efficient, or agile) for services based on their operant resources, which are the intangible resources that act on other resources. Using a qualitative study, we first draw on service-dominant logic and supply chain fit framework to develop the concept of service supply chain fit; that is, the strategic consistency between a service firm’s operant resources and its supply chain. We then validate our model using survey data. The results indicate that service supply chain acts as both moderator and mediator for the relationship between operant resources and firm performance. Our findings indicate that, unless managers view service supply chain fit strategically and invest in developing operant resources for the right supply chain, future COVID-like disruptions may continue to severely impact firm performance. © 2022 INFORMS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133346105&doi=10.1287%2fSERV.2022.0299&partnerID=40&md5=959624cf8290869f31dae9e2f16b6d65,Scopus

Method: A survey questionnaire was administered to 307 supply chain practitioners who were based in the public sector in Gauteng. A structural equation modelling procedure was utilised in testing the proposed relationships. Results: The results of the study showed that six supply chain risk factors, namely government policies, supply complexity, availability of skills, supplier performance monitoring, information security and process efficiency exert significant influences on supply chain flexibility. In turn, supply chain flexibility exerts a positive influence on the performance of the public supply chain.

However, most researches focused on physical layout of a crossdock, or scheduling operations within a crossdock. In this paper, we study a multi-crossdock transshipment service problem with both soft and hard time windows. The flows from suppliers to customers via the crossdocks are constrained by fixed transportation schedules. Cargos can be delayed and consolidated in crossdocks, and both suppliers and customers have specific hard time windows. In addition to hard time windows, customers also have less-restrictive time windows, called soft time windows. The problem to minimize the total cost of the multi-crossdock distribution network, including transportation cost, inventory handling cost and penalty cost, can be proved to be NP-hard in the strong sense and hence efficient heuristics are desired. We propose two types of meta-heuristic algorithms, called Adaptive Tabu Search and Adaptive Genetic Algorithm, respectively, to solve the problem efficiently. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show that both of them outperform CPLEX solver and provide fairly good solutions within realistic timescales.

Design/methodology/approach: Two empirical case studies of CLSC exemplars are used to discuss the theoretical relevance of these views. Findings: The paper shows how strategic resources help companies in two sectors achieve successful CLSC designs. Strategic supply chain collaboration is an important success factor but also presents a number of challenges. The NRBV is used to explain the importance of new resources in technology, knowledge and relationships and stresses the role of DCs to constantly address changes in the business environment to renew these strategic resources. Research limitations/implications: This research elaborates on NRBV theory related to CLSCs and reinforces the inclusion of DCs. It specifies the application of NRBV in the context of textiles and carpet manufacture and highlights the inherent conflicts in seeking value while moving towards sustainable development. Practical implications: Investments in technical and operational resources are required to create CLSCs. Pure closed-loop applications are impractical, requiring relationships with multiple external partners to obtain supply and demand for recycled products. Social implications: CLSCs may provide opportunities for social enterprises or third sector organizations collaborating with manufacturers. Originality/value: This paper provides insights into the constituent resources needed for successful CLSCs. It also helps move CLSC research from a tactical logistics problem to a problem of strategic resources and relational capabilities: what we term “dynamic supply chain execution”.

The main purpose of this study is to be careful against risky suppliers and reducing the injury rate in the event of a disruption. Therefore, in this regard, a multi-stage mixed integer programming model with a proactive approach has been used; that in the first stage, the model reports the amount of supply from suppliers without considering the risk criterion, and at the same time, it seeks to optimal state of minimization the supply chain costs (including purchase cost, shipping, maintenance, supplier selection and return goods). In the second stage, after the suppliers which supplying the parts, have been identified, the model seeks to minimize the identified risks of suppliers under different scenarios. In the third stage, the model tries to achieve an optimal state of supplying the parts from less risky suppliers.

The present study broadly aims at establishing the linkage between various aspects of customer orientations and nature of supply chain exchanges. It serves to address the dilemma which the firm faces while choosing the nature of its exchange relationship with supplier and how does this relationship can impact various aspects of customer orientations. We test our hypotheses on 2000 firms from four countries in Latin America. We take advantage of the 2017 World Bank Enterprise Survey. In addition to descriptive statistics, multiple hierarchical regressions were used to test the study hypotheses and use robust variance estimator to deal with sources of heteroskedasticity in the data. The findings revealed that in order to achieve market flexibility in the form of tailor-made customer fulfilment, firms not only require specificity in exchange with suppliers, but also they should not engage in deep and frequent exchange relationship with its suppliers. Therefore, the supply side capability of flexibly searching and screening suppliers and forming ad hoc contracts as per requirements is necessary to achieve market side flexibility in the form of tailor-made customer fulfilments. It is necessary for firms to resort to matching their customer orientations with their supply side strategy. Only close matching of supplier side relational strategies with customer orientation by aligning firm’s supply side flexibility with market flexibility works well for the firms.

Considering the availability of data and the huge number of supply chains that had their weak links exposed during COVID-19, the objective of the study is to employ artificial intelligence to develop supply chain resilience to withstand extreme disruptions such as COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: We adopted a qualitative approach for interviewing respondents using a semi-structured interview schedule through the lens of organisational information processing theory. A total of 31 respondents from the supply chain and information systems field shared their views on employing artificial intelligence (AI) for supply chain resilience during COVID-19. We used a process of open, axial and selective coding to extract interrelated themes and proposals that resulted in the establishment of our framework. Findings: An AI-facilitated supply chain helps systematically develop resilience in its structure and network. Resilient supply chains in dynamic settings and during extreme disruption scenarios are capable of recognising (sensing risks, degree of localisation, failure modes and data trends), analysing (what-if scenarios, realistic customer demand, stress test simulation and constraints), reconfiguring (automation, re-alignment of a network, tracking effort, physical security threats and control) and activating (establishing operating rules, contingency management, managing demand volatility and mitigating supply chain shock) operations quickly. Research limitations/implications: As the present research was conducted through semi-structured qualitative interviews to understand the role of AI in supply chain resilience during COVID-19, the respondents may have an inclination towards a specific role of AI due to their limited exposure.

Information sharing, and collaboration improve supply chain flexibility, tractability, and efficiency. Several studies have demonstrated, the positive and the significant relationship between supply chain integration and firm performance. Other studies have focused on the factors that affect this relationship. Supply chain complexity is a contingency factor that affects this relationship. Based on the literature review and through a confrontational approach, the authors propose a conceptual model to show how the complexity of supply chain affects the benefit of integration. Propositions are posited with suggestions for further research. Authors suggest that there are three dimensions of supply chain complexity which moderate the effect of supply chain integration on the firm performance: upstream, internal and downstream complexity; that there is a taxonomy of firm’s group based on their level of each dimension of complexity and the effect of integration differs from one group to another.

To do this, we develop two mixed integer nonlinear (MINL) lean and responsive models for a four-tier SC to understand these four strategies: i) holding back-up emergency stocks at the DCs, ii) holding back-up emergency stock for transshipment to all DCs at a strategic DC (for risk pooling in the SC), iii) reserving excess capacity in the facilities, and iv) using other facilities in the SC's network to back-up the primary facilities. A new method for designing the network is developed which works based on the definition of path to cover all possible disturbances. To solve the two proposed MINL models, a linear regression approximation is suggested to linearize the models; this technique works based on a piecewise linear transformation. The efficiency of the solution technique is tested for two prevalent distribution functions. We then explore how these models operate using empirical data from an automotive SC. This enables us to develop a more comprehensive risk mitigation framework than previous studies and show how it can be used to determine the optimal SC design and risk mitigation strategies given the uncertainties faced by practitioners and the performance objectives they wish to meet. © 2015",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949983690&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2015.09.012&partnerID=40&md5=5df5d090207bff9a2b7cb6acb3318474,Scopus

However, no systematic and scientific research has been conducted to develop such an instrument. The present study adopts a comprehensive and rigorous procedure to develop a multifaceted scale for SCF through an empirical investigation. The results of a confirmatory factor analysis suggest that SCF can be operationalized as a second-order factor model comprising four dimensions, namely: sourcing flexibility, operating system flexibility, distribution flexibility, and information system flexibility. A series of goodness-of-fit indices further demonstrates that this scale is internally consistent, reliable, and valid.

To adapt, reduce or eliminate stimuli (uncertainty, disturbances or changes), making the SC more flexible is emerging as a new strategic tool. In reality, SCs are managed by various performance measures and flexibility is one of them, which is being more focused by researchers and industry practitioners. However, Supply Chain Flexibility (SCF) has continued to be a major challenge to comprehend and put it into real practice. An attempt has been made to develop a flexibility scorecard focusing on the flexibility metric in a balanced way.

Managers of supply chain (SC) are therefore under pressure to build high level of flexibility in the SC operations. However, supply chain flexibility (SCF) is a complex, dynamic, multifaceted, context specific and application-oriented concept, viewed from a strategic and customer perspective. SCF is not easy to comprehend and put into real practice, the foremost reason is the diverse nature of the three forces viz. stimuli, enablers and inhibitors and their dynamics in the SC. In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate SCF from a company perspective, especially in the viewpoint of making SCF a reality. The relevant data collected from the organisation is used to analyse the dynamics among the three forces using force field analysis (FFA).

To be competitive by quickly responding to disruptions, building enough flexibility in SCs is emerging as a new business strategy. However, it is very difficult to identify how much flexibility is required in different functions of the SC, as it depends on the nature and level of uncertainty faced by the process, facility or organization. In this paper, SCF is logically attributed to a business function synonymously with the efficiency of the corresponding business unit, wherein the leveraging factors are treated as the inputs and the benefits as the outputs. Here, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach is used as a benchmarking tool for deriving the advantage of optimisation in many ways.

The motivation is to accomplish organisational goals, namely to increase supply chain flexibility by responding to evermore-varying customer demands in a timely manner. The purpose of the study described in this paper was to develop a conceptual framework that adopts performance measures for ex-ante decision-making at an operational level within the supply chain. To guide the research, five questions were asked and subsequently key gaps have been identified. In an attempt to fill the gaps, a case study at a major global brand beverage company has been carried out, and as a result, a conceptual framework of the PMS has been developed. Overall, the research offers a foundation of the applicability and impact of PMS in the supply chain and provides a framework that attends to some of the potential uses of PMS that so far have not been practically applied. The outcomes from the testing indicate that the initial gaps identified in the literature have been addressed and that the framework is judicious with scope for practical applicability.

Demand for the former products will be relatively stable and predictable, but demand for the latter will be far more uncertain. In addition, the profit margin commanded by the innovative product will probably be higher than that of the more functional product. However, the price (and therefore the margin) of the innovative product may drop rapidly once it has become unfashionable in the market. The supply chain policies that are seen to be appropriate for functional products and innovative products are termed by Fisher efficient supply chain policies and responsive supply chain policies, respectively. By contrast, responsive supply chain policy stresses high service levels and responsive supply to the end-customer. The inventory in the network will be deployed as closely as possible to the customer. In this way, the chain can still supply even when dramatic changes occur in customer demand. Fast throughput from the upstream parts of the chain will still be needed to replenish downstream stocks. However, those downstream stocks are needed to ensure high levels of availability to end-customers. © 2018 Newswood Limited. .

Since productivity increases with specialization, it is presumably difficult for such producers to achieve high levels of labor productivity in each of the tasks they perform (in terms of organizing the work and controlling for costs). This study reports on the results of a detailed analysis of the apparent labor productivity in each activity segment (production, processing and distribution) on farms in Quebec (Canada) that market through short food supply chains. We adapted the concept of a complex activity system and the Work Assessment method to reflect the context in Quebec and the unique features of integrated farming models based on direct marketing. In total, we analyzed work organization on 32 Quebec farms to determine how added value and work hours are allocated among different activity segments. Our analysis of apparent labor productivity highlights the heterogeneity of farms involved in direct marketing as every farm studied had a unique profile. In addition, work patterns reflected the background, choices and skillsets of farmers and different combinations of production factors were utilized. Overall, labor productivity was lower in production-related tasks, although this was often offset by higher productivity levels in other activity segments. Our results indicate that greater productivity in the areas of processing or distribution allows farms in short food supply chains to be financially sustainable. The findings of our study also confirm that farmers involved in direct marketing work hard to sustain their activity systems, even though net earnings are often low when compared to the amount of effort involved. However, farmers are partially compensated in other ways, such as through client appreciation and work enjoyment.

The data were analysed using ethnographic content analysis in three stages, which generated propositions aligned to aggregate dimensions identified in the literature. The findings suggest that there is an underlying demand and value for increased integration, and a willingness and trust amongst the focal actors to integrate more with upstream and horizontal partners. However, implementation would be hindered by the focal actors’ limited capabilities and maturity in supply chain management and supply chain integration.

Specifically, cloud-based distributed manufacturing has become a viable service for small and medium companies and prosumers, since it caters to the needs of these stakeholders. Distributed manufacturing offers significant benefits, including reduced cost, shorter lead time, and increased supply-chain flexibility. With interest in these services on the rise, however, there have not been substantial efforts to assess the sustainability performance of cloud-based distributed manufacturing. Sustainability assessment tools are not able to accommodate the unique attributes of cloud-based manufacturing, including broad geographic distribution, real-time autonomous customer support, and dynamic supply chains and processes driven by customer preferences. Thus, this research aims to develop an adaptive sustainability assessment framework for evaluating cloud-based distributed manufacturing systems using an integrated sustainability indicator for environmental, economic, and social impacts. The framework is demonstrated for distributed additive manufacturing as a service. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors assembled a data set of forecasts and sales of 169 still-camera models, made by the same manufacturer and sold by three different retailers in France over five years. Collaboration intensity, coded by collaborative planning forecasting and replenishment level, was used to analyze the main effects and specific interaction effects of all variables using ANOVA and ordered feature evaluation analysis (OFEA). Findings - The findings lend empirical support to the long-standing assumption that supply chain collaboration intensity increases demand forecast accuracy and that product maturation also increases forecast accuracy even in short life-cycle products. Furthermore, the findings show that it is particularly the lack of collaboration that causes negative effects on forecast accuracy, while positive interaction effects are only found for life cycle stage and product category. Practical implications - Investment in adaptive supply chain collaboration is shown to increase demand forecast accuracy. However, the choice of collaboration intensity should account for life cycle stage, retailer type and product category.

Despite the interest, methods to support supply chains to strategically exploit RMSs are still missing, while being highly needed. In this paper, a method—consisting of an index to assess machines reusability and a mixed integer programming (MIP) algorithm—is provided to support the identification of reusable and reconfigurable machine candidates at the early stage of the strategic network design.

Hence, the attention of managers and researchers has been attracted to one of the most crucial problems in the supply chain management area called the supply chain network design problem. In this regard, this research attempts to design an integrated forward and backward logistics network by proposing a multi-objective mathematical model. The suggested model aims at minimizing the environmental impacts and the costs while maximizing the resilience and responsiveness of the supply chain. Since uncertainty is a major issue in the supply chain problem, the present paper studies the research problem under the mixed uncertainty and utilizes the robust possibilistic stochastic method to cope with the uncertainty. On the other side, since configuring a supply chain is known as an NP-Hard problem, this research develops an enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain optimal/near-optimal solutions in a reasonable time. Based on the achieved results, the developed algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions (i.e. solutions with zero or a very small gap from the optimal solution) in a reasonable amount of time. The achieved results demonstrate the negative impact of the enhancement of the demand on environmental damages and the total cost. Also, according to the outputs, by increasing the service level, the total cost and environmental impacts have increased by 41% and 10%, respectively. On the other hand, the results show that increasing the disrupted capacity parameters has led to a 17% increase in the total costs and a 7% increase in carbon emissions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137453366&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-022-07739-8&partnerID=40&md5=898307cd17c2d0c6ce2e92970d37f46b,Scopus

Consequently, it is vital for wine producers to implement the industry best practices and continuously adapt their supply chain processes in order to survive. As supply chain management practices create value for wine producers, stakeholders and throughout the supply chain, it is key that the performance of the supply chain is measured. Currently limited research has been conducted in supply chain efficiency and the utilisation of performance metrics in the South African wine industry. It is against this background that this study aims to determine whether the South African wine industry should have a standard set of metrics to be used for comparative purposes across the South African. A case study approach was adopted for this study. Data was collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews using an interview guide with ten participants at five wine producing estates located in the different wine growing areas within the Stellenbosch region. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. The findings reveal that the participating wine producing estates have simple internal performance metrics in place that meet their immediate operational needs. However, they do not look beyond to see how measuring, and monitoring key supply chain metrics, and by using these to benchmark their supply chain performance against their competitors, may help them identify opportunities for improvement for their estates. Providing details of the potential insights and benefits that the South African wine producers could gain by measuring and monitoring supply chain performance and benchmarking their results against their peers and the industry leaders. We contribute by providing approaches for vineyards and wineries to improve their supply chain performance using metrics.

Implementing circularity in business operations is a practice of achieving sustainability which is of utmost significance for achieving sustainable development goals established by the United Nations. This study empirically examines the relation among flexibility, AI–IoT adoption, and SC firm performance under the circular economy (CE) environment based on resource orchestration theory (ROT), an integrated version of the extended-resource-based view, and dynamic capability theory (DCT). Data were collected from Indian manufacturing firms through a questionnaire-based survey and examined using “structural equation modeling (SEM).” The study results show that information flexibility and organizational flexibility have the highest impact on AI–IoT adoption. Organizational flexibility shows full mediation with AI–IoT, which would influence the SC firm performance directly. The analysis also indicates that CE will affect the relation between organizational flexibility and AI–IoT adoption. These findings pave the way for cross-country analysis, formation of practical strategies, and policies related to AI–IoT and CE implementations. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119086749&doi=10.1002%2fbse.2935&partnerID=40&md5=3f884dfcbc482dda20c5c2b10b430909,Scopus

For this purpose, a multi-objective mathematical model is proposed that minimizes the environmental impacts and the total costs and maximizes the social impacts while considering the resilience and responsiveness of the global supply chain. Then, the modified fuzzy robust stochastic method is employed to tackle the uncertainty. This study selects one of the most important medical devices during the pandemic (COVID-19) namely the blood bank refrigerator as a case study. Afterwards, the proposed multi-objective model is solved by developing a novel method named as augmented lexicographic weighted Tchebycheff method. Based on the obtained results, an increase in the responsiveness level of the supply chain can lead to increasing the sustainability dimensions, including job opportunities, safety, carbon emission, and economic aspects. Moreover, an increase in demands harms the economic, environmental, and responsiveness targets.

To achieve this understanding, it is not only important to have a good understanding of individual firm’s manufacturing flexibility next to supply chain flexibility, but also to consider the internal (among production network’s facilities) and external (other tiers of supply chain) relationships in a production network. Studying the production network’s flexibility dimensions facilitates the effective use of the synergy of cooperation in the network. On other words, the potential in the network structure cannot be exploited unless the planning and control of network consider the available flexibility of network and operationalize the opportunities which arise. This paper identifies different dimensions of flexibility in a production network and describes how they can support firms in responding to customers’ needs. This research employs exploratory and descriptive approaches and uses a single case study of Norwegian diary to capture the dynamics of production networks. Three product categories with different network characteristics are selected, and the identified network flexibility dimensions are investigated for these products.

In this course, the fundamentals of supply chain and logistics, drivers of supply chain performance and analytical tools necessary to develop solutions for a variety of supply chain design problems are covered through class lectures and case study discussions. In the past few years, due to the growth in the needs of organizations for ""Lean"" principles, the course was modified to satisfy this requirement more efficiently. For this purpose a hands on experience workshop, TimeWise simulation game, was utilized where the students could physically simulate the implementation of lean principles in a supply chain network. Through this simulation, students explored the impact of various lean tools such as Kanban, pull and just-in-time production systems, and flow management in a dynamic supply chain. In addition, this game empowers the learners with a better understanding of the fundamental concepts of a collaborative supply chain such as demand management, inventory management, role of information system and coordination, transportation, finance and accounting. The implemented simulation game could enhance material retention and foster critical thinking among the students by increasing visibility and illustrating the concerns of any supply chain. Moreover, several directed presentations by speakers invited from diverse industries and ISM (Institute of Supply Chain Management) were arranged to expose the students to some real case studies.

To overcome the potential adverse selection problem due to the asymmetric information, the supplier designs a menu of supply contracts that stipulates both the wholesale price and the purchasing quantity. We find that under information asymmetry, the supplier will optimally set a higher wholesale price but a lower purchasing quantity for the manufacturer with high innovation efficiency than that for the manufacturer with low innovation efficiency. As a consequence, the manufacturer with high innovation efficiency will significantly underinvest in innovation due to information asymmetry in addition to the impact of the double marginalization effect. Moreover, although a longer contract period tends to better motivate innovation, it can also magnify the influences of adverse selection on supply chain contracting, leading to a higher wholesale price for the manufacturer with high innovation efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087220455&doi=10.1016%2fj.ejor.2020.06.008&partnerID=40&md5=42bc030986a2c1f768541237139f85fe,Scopus

This is particularly true in market economies and for agricultural commodities, but the economic performance of food systems has global relevance. Analysis of markets for food-especially from a systems perspective-provides insights about how to improve outcomes from food systems. In addition, the organizational structures that link different actors in a food system can often be usefully considered from the perspective of supply chains. As a result, economic and supply chain analyses of food systems issues can complement other analytical perspectives and support informed decision making to improve desired outcomes. This chapter emphasizes three commonly-used types of economic and supply chain models: spatial optimization models, partial equilibrium models, and dynamic supply chain models based on participatory group modeling building and system dynamics. For each, we provide an overview of the mathematical structure of the model, discuss the kinds of food system issues for which these models are most appropriate, indicate data needs and suggest priority areas for future development and application.

Research on supply chain resilience has established flexibility as a firm-level antecedent that contributes to supply chain resilience. However, the authors know little about how supply chain flexibility is developed within a firm. Drawing on social capital theory, the authors claim that the way supply chain managers are embedded in their social networks plays a critical role in developing this antecedent. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that supply chain managers' structural and relational embeddedness in their reference network, comprised of individuals from whom they seek advice, is instrumental to developing supply chain flexibility, which subsequently enhances the firm's supply chain resilience. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data collected from 485 manufacturing firms in Australia and Hayes and Preacher's (2014) parallel multiple mediator model were employed to empirically test the hypotheses. Findings: The findings of the study establish that supply chain managers' structural and relational embeddedness in their reference network indeed have implications for developing supply chain resilience. Furthermore, the mediator through which managers' social embeddedness influences supply chain resilience is identified in the current study.

We study analytically the effect of large and sudden increases in replenishment lead times on the system, and derive the performance behaviour of the system, looking at how quickly the system recovers from the disruption and is restored to normal operation, with the objective of being able to come up with a dynamic control scheme with enhanced performance. We find that the conventional dynamic control schemes perform poorly; and we therefore propose a modified dynamic control scheme which enhances the control and performance of such systems. Additionally, we present a comparison of the performance of this system with that of one with zero lag and sudden demand increase, which highlights the increased difficulty of controlling this system with sudden lags compared to the other.

The authors examine how the interaction of information exchange, partner interaction, knowledge sharing and flexibility as mediated through partner satisfaction effectuates firm performance. The goal of this research is to answer the supply chain managers’ need to better understand where to invest their time and effort to get improved firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The model was tested with panel data from 105 experienced, US-based supply chain managers. Structural equation modeling using partial least squares approach was utilized to conduct the analysis. Findings: The results provide crucial evidence that simple information exchange among supply chain partners does not result in improvements in firm performance or partner satisfaction, but, when mediated through the flexibility construct, it does. Further, the use of integration tools has a moderating effect on the relationship between flexibility and firm performance. The results suggest that working closely with supply chain partners helps ensure improved relationship satisfaction, and can reduce issues that can impact firm performance.

Drawing on the relational view of strategic management, the impact of relational capabilities on two forms of supply chain flexibility is examined – configuration flexibility (CF) for switching suppliers with minimal penalties, and planning and control flexibility (PCF) for altering supply schedules, quality, and delivery lead-time. Design/methodology/approach: Strategic- and tactical-level managers from 211 retail stores in the UK were surveyed. The authors validated a measurement model with structural equation modelling and tested four hypotheses on the mediating role of relational capabilities on supply chain flexibility and retail performance, controlling for size, duration of relationship, and market segment. Findings: Results showed that the three relational capabilities partially mediated the positive effect of CF and PCF on operational performance in big middle and niche retailers. Examining the interaction effect of the forms of flexibility on the relational capabilities and performance, the authors found positive interaction effects on TMS and OI but a non-significant effect on AC. Practical implications: In addition to providing novel theoretical insights on supply chain flexibility, the findings have practical implications for supplier selection and buyer-supplier relationship management.

To understand the influence of operating variables on the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water consumption, a dynamic supply chain model was linked with life cycle assessment (LCA) to produce an environmental inventory. Water is a critical natural resource, and understanding the environmental impacts of recycling water is paramount in continued development of sustainable supply chains involving water. The methodology used in this study bridged the gap between detailed process models and static LCA modeling so that operating variables beyond discrete scenario analysis could be investigated without creating unnecessarily complex models. The model performed well in evaluating environmental impacts. It was found that there was no single optimum operating regime for all environmental impacts. For a mill discharging 80 cubic meters of effluent per hour (m3/hour), GHGs could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 17.5 m3/hour, while water consumption could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 25 m3/hour, which allowed insight into where environmental trade-offs would occur. The study shows that more complexity can be achieved in supply chain modeling without requiring a full technical model. It also illustrates the need to consider multiple environmental impacts and highlights the trade-off of GHG emissions with water consumption in water recycling. The supply chain model used in this water treatment case study was able to identify the environmental trade-offs from the operating variables selected. © 2013 by Yale University.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885478011&doi=10.1111%2fjiec.12029&partnerID=40&md5=4010ae7be027807d1c0aa4d099861532,Scopus

This paper examines the influence of flexibility strategies in a dynamic global market environment on the structure of supply network, and proposes a method of reconfiguring the supply network of an enterprise to cope with its flexibility strategies. A reconfigurable supply network model is proposed, and flexibility strategies are classified, and critical indices of strategies are defined.

Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine how firms in Indonesia develop resilience through the implementation of components of adaptive supply chain management, namely risk management, resource reconfiguration and supply chain flexibility, in order to survive severe supply chain disruption. Research design, data and methodology: A qualitative method and PLS-SEM were used to analyze 120 data collected from Indonesian manufacturing firms in various industries. Results: The findings show that risk management, resource reconfiguration, and supply chain flexibility are important components that make up A-SCM. However, only risk management contributes to help build firm resilience in the presence of severe supply chain disruption. Conclusions: The components of A-SCM have been empirically tested. The implication is that managers should carefully use RM to prepare firms for different scenarios to develop contingency strategies.

Consequently, local production disruptions, for instance caused by extreme weather events, are likely to induce indirect losses along supply chains with potentially global repercussions. These complex loss dynamics represent a challenge for comprehensive disaster risk assessments. Here, we introduce the numerical agent-based model acclimate designed to analyze the cascading of economic losses in the global supply network. Using national sectors as agents, we apply the model to study the global propagation of losses induced by stylized disasters. We find that indirect losses can become comparable in size to direct ones, but can be efficiently mitigated by warehousing and idle capacities. Consequently, a comprehensive risk assessment cannot focus solely on first-tier suppliers, but has to take the whole supply chain into account. To render the supply network climate-proof, national adaptation policies have to be complemented by international adaptation efforts. In that regard, our model can be employed to assess reasonable leverage points and to identify dynamic bottlenecks inaccessible to static analyses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032025424&doi=10.1016%2fj.jedc.2017.08.001&partnerID=40&md5=bbfc0deb236bd26ccfcca39845647fd0,Scopus

Foster School of Business, University of Washington, Seattle, United States","The paper investigates the extent to which capacity investment considerations interact with the double marginalization effect in a simple supply chain governed by a wholesale price contract. To do so, a non-cooperative differential game model is formulated to study the pricing and capacity investment decisions in a supply chain, which consists of a supplier and a manufacturer. In such a game, there are different decision rules-open-loop, closed-loop, feedback-that are available to the supply chain participants, depending on the observability of the current state of the supply chain. While closed-loop and feedback equilibrium strategies involve the observability of other chain member's production capacity, open-loop equilibrium strategies do not have such requirement. We examine how the supplier and the manufacturer determine, with the different decision rules, their production capacities and pricing policies to maximize their profits over an infinite planning horizon, and determine how the observability of other supply chain's members' production capacity affects the magnitude of the double marginalization effect. Our study suggests that the observability of other chain member's current production capacity entails a lower production efficiency that results in a greater double marginalization effect. This allows us to conclude that observability of other chain member's current production capacity is associated with a greater double marginalization effect. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Therefore, whether they can be reliable energy sources to provide uninterrupted energy demand when reaching a high share of renewable energy in the system depends on the whole energy supply network. Higher flexibility of RES-based systems can be reached through the development of smart energy concepts. The system dynamics model coupled with a geographical information system platform has been used to analyse space and time dimensions of RES potential using geo-referenced information. This approach allows analysing the whole energy system by determining the best-suited development scenario for each region separately, based on their resource, economic, and technological capabilities. Furthermore, the system dynamics model is complemented with different policies to evaluate their impact on renewable and local energy resource development and economic potential. The results show that the potential for large-scale onshore wind farm capacities with suitable land conditions could be around 5.5 GW, but the forecasted necessary wind power capacity to reach climate neutrality in 2050 is 1.55 GW.

A stable supply chain is where operations are routinized across smooth inter-organizational relationships.

However, unusual situations present emergent, unpredictable risk and require management that is qualitatively different from that in standardized practice. In the face of risky supply chains, adaptive leaders exercise “creative deviance,” and seek to influence others in the chain to diverge from their habitualized frames of reference through divergence and value patterning.

Discrete and continuous time methodologies were used to identify the optimal value and timing of the options to adopt, when the demand is stochastic. Additionally, the effect of market requirements, such as product mix complexity and service level, were also taken into consideration. The demand is modeled under different stochastic processes; the impact of unexpected shocks is also explored, which enhances the generalization of the models to different business conditions. The applicability of the models enables the diversification and enrichment of the literature on the real options approach, within supply chain concept.

The two objective functions developed in this model represent the minimization of the total cost of supplies including transportation and maximization of reliability of the set of suppliers.

The study builds on a sample of 222 articles published from 1996 to 2018 in international, peer-reviewed journals. The analysis of the sample involves two complementary approaches: the co-word technique to identify the thematic clusters as well as their relative standing and a critical reflection on the papers to explain the intellectual content of these thematic clusters. The results of the co-word analysis show that MSCF is a dynamic topic with a rich and complex structure that comprises five thematic clusters. The value chain, capability and volatility clusters showed research topics that were taking a central role in the discussion on MSCF but were not mature yet. The SC purchasing practices and SC planning clusters involved work that was more focused and could be considered more mature.

Efficient inventory management is a complex process which entails the management of the inventory in the whole supply chain. The dynamic nature of the excess stock level and shortage level over all the periods is a serious issue when implementation is considered. In addition, consideration of multiple factories manufacturing the same product leads to very complex inventory management process The complexity of the problem increases when lead times of stocks are involved.

However, current research lacks appropriate methods guiding practitioners in successfully implementing these measures. As implementing flexibility in most cases comes along with an increase in costs, the decisions which flexibility measures to implement require a trade-off between the benefit gained from an increased flexibility, and the costs which apply. The purpose of this paper is to provide a first approach to evaluating this trade-off using discrete event simulation. The concept is presented and evaluated by means of a practical scenario from the table-top product manufacturing industry using the adjustment of production lot sizes and safety stock levels as example flexibility measures.

The automotive industry is one of the most vital industries in the Brazilian economy and is still recovering from the 2015 financial crisis, making it an interesting case for this research. Findings: The findings reveal several links between resilience and cross-functional integration literatures through the analysis of three basic categories, namely, disruptions (lack of product, interruption of production, delivery delay, organizational bankruptcy and sales loss); capabilities (redundancy, flexibility, adaptability, collaboration, visibility and agility); and integration factors (cross-functional meetings, adequate communication, longevity of relationships, cross-functional training, recognition of interdependence and the consideration given to informal groups).

Design/methodology/approach: To measure the above stated correlation, a Likert scale with five points and 23 items was used and structural equation modeling was applied. The scale was applied to public hospitals. Statistical software programs (SPSS 18 and LISREL 8.8) were used to analyze the data. The analysis of reported statistics is based on a sample of 129 logistics and SC specialists at public hospitals in the cities representing different regions of Turkey. Findings: The research hypotheses are supported as a result of the analysis. The research reveals that SC flexibility has a mediation effect between SC integration, demand forecasting, supplier performance and patient responsiveness. Practical implications: The increasing number of population, geopolitical position, migration waves, man-made and natural disasters lead Turkish health-care industry to have effective SC plans to satisfy the patients’ needs successfully and reduce the effects of these fatal events. In this sense, SC flexibility is an important factor for health-care industry in responding changing patient demands. At this juncture, the main point is to bring required resources together in the right place and at the right time. Otherwise, health-care institutions cannot serve the affected people because of the non-availability of supply. To achieve it, public health-care institutions should give more importance to the SC principles. Originality/value: Success in SC flexibility in health care can directly affect patient welfare. Thus, focusing on the patient responsiveness is an important aim of the health-care industry. However, it was determined that less attention has been given to understanding patient satisfaction as a result of SC operations. The results indicate that patient responsiveness improvement should be included into strategic plans, and SC efforts should be used as a means of satisfying patient needs quickly.

This dynamic phenomenon is not yet well understood in closed-loop supply chain settings, despite their growing importance in modern societies pursuing circular economy opportunities. Indeed, the problem-specific literature has provided somewhat conflicting findings. To better understand the Bullwhip Effect in closed-loop systems, we obtain expressions for the order and inventory variance amplification in four archetypes that differ in the structure of information transparency. Interestingly, we observe that the impact of return rates and lead times on the system performance strongly depend on the degree of supply chain visibility. This perspective allows us to revisit discrepancies in prior works. We later move the study from the operational to the economic prism. Here we prove the existence of an optimal return rate, and we derive its expression in the four closed-loop supply chain archetypes.

Two key 'sources' of flexibility are investigated: vendor flexibility and sourcing flexibility. The paper introduces an extension of the 'leagility' concept beyond the simple material flow decoupling point concept. Two new types of leagility are put forward: (1) leagile with vendor flexibility systems, which combine the use of agile vendors with lean sourcing practices and (2) leagile with sourcing flexibility systems, which combine the use of lean vendors with agile sourcing practices. Case studies of two UK based specialist fashion retailers' supply networks are presented in order to gain insights into the sourcing strategies used and the sources of flexibility employed by retailers at supply network level. A new taxonomy that dynamically links vendor and sourcing flexibility with lean, agile and leagile supply network strategies is proposed. We suggest that the proposed taxonomy can be used as a guideline for firms designing and managing parallel supply pipelines that match different operating environments. The findings add to the understanding of the ways in which the two sources of supply network flexibility (vendor and sourcing) interact in practice and provide evidence of the ways in which companies can strike balances between these sources, as well as the effects that can be achieved and some of the trade-offs involved. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896341151&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2014.02.002&partnerID=40&md5=efc5410b38d9dded9736264b37a58261,Scopus

Using the notion of distinct business models and trade-offs as our theoretical lens, the purpose of this study was to: (1) Distinguish lean and agile firms based upon production methods; and (2) Compare lean and agile levels of external flexibility (EF) and supply chain flexibility (SCF). Data was obtained from 140 automotive firms in the Midlands (UK) via a survey which was sent by emails. Findings supported the theoretical notion of trade-offs, as firms implementing agile production methods were found to be more flexible in comparison with firms implementing lean production methods. More importantly, the agile firms that possessed high EF levels and SCF levels were predominantly positioned at the lower end of the automotive supply chain, whereas the lean firms were largely found to be operating at the top of the supply chain. First, we provide an innovative way in which lean and agile firms can be conceptualised. Second, as flexibility levels were assessed on actual numerical values, as opposed to using opinion based Likert Scale questions, a methodological contribution is made.

Similarly, ""agile"" supplier practices when aligned with the ""IS for Flexibility"" IS strategy, have a positive association with supply chain flexibility. The paper empirically validates the model using survey data from directors and senior managers in purchasing and supply chain functions from 205 manufacturing firms in the USA. Factor analysis was conducted to test convergent and discriminant validity. Hypotheses testing was done via structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis using SMART Partial Least Square (PLS) software. Findings: The study finds that lean (agile) supplier management practices are positively associated with supply chain integration (flexibility).

Researchers are designing All-in-One theoretic models to optimize CSCC with the assumed decision details of all enterprises, while in fact clustered enterprises are seeking effective decentralized decision mechanisms which protect their decision autonomy in the frequently re-configured CSC. A newly emerged multi-disciplinary optimization method, Augmented Lagrangian Coordination (ALC), which supports the open-structure collaboration with strict optimization convergence, is thoroughly investigated in this paper and applied to solve the conflict. Through a complete analysis of CSC's configuration policies in typical stages, a generic CSCC model is proposed and then partitioned into an ALC-based decentralized decision model by the typical decision autonomy distribution in clusters. Clustered enterprises collaborate vertically and laterally along the ALC model through multi-dimensional couplings to achieve the overall consistency and optimality.

While the huge impact of the pandemic has nurtured important literature over the last couple of years, little is being said about the role of resource orchestration in supporting resilience in highly disruptive contexts. Thus, this study aims to this knowledge gap by proposing an original model to explore supply chain resilience (SCRE) antecedents, considering supply chain alertness (SCAL) as a central point to support resilience. This study focuses on the resource orchestration theory (ROT) to design a conceptual model. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) served to validate the model, exploring data from the UK supply chain decision-makers. The study reveals a number of both expected and unexpected findings. These include the evidence that supply chain disruption orientation (SCDO) has a strong positive effect on the SCAL. In addition, SCAL plays a strong positive effect in resource reconfiguration (RREC), supply chain efficiency (SCEF) and SCRE. We further identified a partial mediation effect of RREC on the relationship between SCAL and SCRE. Surprisingly, it appeared that SCAL strongly influences SCEF, while SCEF itself does not create any significant effect on SCRE. For managers and practitioners, the importance of resource orchestration as a decisive approach to adequately respond to huge disruptions is clearly highlighted by our results.

The methodology used is made up of five steps: formulation of the research questions, identification of studies, selection and evaluation of studies, analysis and synthesis and presentation of the results. Findings: Three main research topics have been identified: personalization levels and flexible processes in supply chain, where flexible processes in supply chain are analysed as a productive response to high levels of MP; supply chain collaborative processes for SCF and MP, where product co-creation and relationships between supply chain members is analysed; and SCF and MP enabling technologies, in which technologies to support MP implementation and SCF are considered.

It is a question of ongoing debate among practitioners about the role of flexibility and complexity in building resilience for firms and their supply chains. In this research, we examine the flexible business strategies at the demand, supply, and process side of supply chains contributing to resilience. Five of the major flexible business strategies were acknowledged in this research and the single items for constructing them were posited. In this study, we observe the correlations among the constructs based on survey-based research in electronics manufacturing firms, followed by a dimensionality reduction of constructs using factor analysis. The data collected were subject to several initial tests for ensuring validity, reliability, and adequacy using relevant statistical indicators. The measurement model was converted into a structural model and path coefficients were determined. From the path analysis, the latent variables contributing to flexibility in supply chains were found to be independent estimators of resilience. Adding to it, we observe that the single items for measuring the flexibility of supply, process, product, and pricing strategies were evidenced to be strongly correlated. The results are useful to managers for taking decisions related to flexibility implementation, towards enhancing resilience in supply chains. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096530474&doi=10.1016%2fj.jmsy.2020.10.010&partnerID=40&md5=4b67f5f60c6235e73aca5abc3c30dd03,Scopus

In this study, supply chain network design problem is investigated and an efficient solution approach is presented. Specifically, a heuristic graph theoretic-based algorithm is proposed for solving a multi-echelon responsive supply chain network design problem with lateral-transshipment among retailers. The possibility of lateral-transshipment is considered to increase the customer satisfaction by increasing the availability of the goods, and to reduce total inventory handling costs. Consideration of lateral transshipment provides a trade-off between transportation costs and inventory handling costs at the retailers. Graph theory is used to investigate and study the structure of the supply chain network and it is shown that the network can be reduced to a k-partite graph. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with an exact commercial solver on test problems. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm generates high-quality solutions in a reasonable time in comparison with the exact solver. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053541406&doi=10.1007%2fs12351-018-0425-y&partnerID=40&md5=74eefca74a1e15f98793680011b128a5,Scopus

A leading driver is the energy-economy cycle, where poor economic status, inefficient utilization of limited budget, and energy deficiency reinforced each other and led these countries into a spiral of economic downfall. How to turn this cycle around? It is a classic question but not well answered in the energy policy/economics literature and barely studied in the operations management literature. We apply supply chain design and location optimization models to address the unique features of the energy sector in these countries and present a new class of mathematical models for designing coal-fired energy supply chains. The model captures the interaction among different parts of an integrated energy supply chain, the unique economics of power transmission such as yield losses, the political issues associated with equity, and the dynamic interaction among energy consumption, economy and budget. The model attempts to answer the classic question by determining the optimal and politically feasible ways to build up an energy supply chain under limited budgets for energy security and economic prosperity. Applying the model to Pakistan's recent energy crises, we show that the solutions can significantly outperform the government's plan by reducing the energy gaps faster, boosting the economy stronger with less greenhouse gas emissions.

One potential cause for failure is the lack of comprehending the nature of the demand and therefore being unable to device a supply-chain that would better satisfy that demand. A common mistake is to use an efficient supply chain that calls for a responsive supply chain and vice versa. The paper aims to develop the first wave of empirical investigations related to the impact of supply chain design practices on performance. It investigated a supply chain design model that linked efficiency with responsiveness to optimize performance by deploying postponement. An in-depth case study methodology was adopted to uncover the strategies undertaken by one of the Bangladesh's fastest growing cement manufacturers to create a competitive advantage through its management of the supply chain design alignment. The major elements were verified by surveys. Applicability and exploitability of the diagnostic instrument was validated using action research. Generally, the adoption of segmenting the supply chain process by diffusing the postponing style led to an improved performance, which, in turn, positively impact operational performance. Operational performance enhances organizational performance. Just as processes can be broken into parts, so can supply-chain processes be segmented to achieve optimal performance.

However, there is limited evidence regarding how governance mechanisms influence the generation of value from collaboration. Furthermore, how a particular buyer or supplier position provides benefits to partners is unclear. In this paper, we examine the roles of management control information as both a governance mechanism and a source of dynamic capabilities, and its interaction with relational variables to create and capture value following a demand-side perspective. Two separate studies are developed using multigroup structural equation modelling, which analyse buyer and supplier positions played by the firm as a complex supply chain node. The results demonstrate that the characteristics of information sharing have different impacts on value, depending on the role played in the relationship. Although timely information sharing appears to be the key source of operative and financial value in downstream relationships, disaggregated information sharing generates additional strategic advantages in upstream relationships.

Supply chain selection depends on different criteria like total supply chain cost, volume flexibility, service level etc. In lieu of this, supply chain selection is considered as Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem. Several authors solved MCDM problems without considering vagueness in the decision-maker's subjective judgements. Hence an attempt is now made in this paper to focus on vagueness in ranking supply chains against multiple criteria. A numerical example of eight supply chains are taken into consideration and ranked through Fuzzy Outranking Technique (FOT) and the results are compared with Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The high incidence of COVID-19 related respiratory failure has exposed critical shortages in the supply of mechanical ventilators, and providers with the necessary skills to treat. Traditional mass-produced ventilators rely on an internal compressor and mixer to moderate and control the gas mixture delivered to a patient. However, the current emergency has energized the pursuit of alternative designs, enabling greater flexibility in supply chain, manufacturing, storage, and maintenance considerations. To achieve this, we hypothesized that using the medical gasses and flow interruption strategy would allow for a high performance, low cost, functional ventilator. A low-cost ventilator designed and built-in accordance with the Emergency Use guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is presented wherein pressurized medical grade gases enter the ventilator and time limited flow interruption determines the ventilator rate and tidal volume. This simple strategy obviates the need for many components needed in traditional ventilators, thereby dramatically shortening the time from storage to clinical deployment, increasing reliability, while still providing life-saving ventilatory support. The overall design philosophy and its applicability in this new crisis is described, followed by both bench top and animal testing results used to confirm the precision, safety and reliability of this low cost and novel approach to mechanical ventilation. The ventilator meets and exceeds the critical requirements included in the FDA emergency use guidelines. The ventilator has received emergency use authorization from the FDA.

Generally, the HSC echelons include gathering raw material centres, production facilities and hydrogen distribution and storage centres. The proposed approach introduces a mix-integer linear programming (MILP) model optimising the HSC network at the strategic level of decision-making through minimising both capital and operational costs of the HSC. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is accomplished on the transportation cost of materials within the HSC network which constitutes the major share of total costs.

Traditionally the main aims of a supply chain are of an economic nature, i.e. to provide high service levels at the lowest possible cost. Social and environmental dimensions are usually not considered as part of comprehensive supply chain strategy. Rising consumer awareness and stricter governmental regulations are driving factors that force companies to extend the sustainability concept into their supply chains. Integral supply chain concepts like Just-In-Time, outsourcing, offshoring, small batch sizes and frequent deliveries appear to be incompatible with an integrated sustainability approach. This research addresses several associated problems in three interconnected steps. Firstly, key issues in supply chain management have to be identified. Secondly, trade-offs between economic, environmental, and social goals have to be assessed. Finally, these findings have to be formulated into an integrated approach that outlines how supply chains can adapt key operational issues to support a holistic sustainability strategy.

Several studies have investigated the most cost-efficient hydrogen supply chain structure, with a focus on hydrogen transportation. However, supply chain models based on hydrogen produced by electrolysis require additional seasonal hydrogen storage capacity to close the gap between fluctuation in renewable generation from surplus electricity and fuelling station demand. To address this issue, we developed a model that draws on and extends approaches in the literature with respect to long-term storage. Thus, we analyse Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) and show their potential impact on future hydrogen mobility. We demonstrate that LOHC-based pathways are highly promising especially for smaller-scale hydrogen demand and if storage in salt caverns remains uncompetitive, but emit more greenhouse gases (GHG) than other gaseous or hydrogen ones. Liquid hydrogen as a seasonal storage medium offers no advantage compared to LOHC or cavern storage since lower electricity prices for flexible operation cannot balance the investment costs of liquefaction plants.

In the case of the ophthalmology sector, however, the purchase of contact lenses and prescription glasses requires professional examination by a trained eye specialist. This peculiarity of the sector affects the shift toward omnichannel. This paper is novel in that it addresses a research gap by studying the distribution channels for regulated products and services such as health products that required a closer professional service. This paper addresses the transformation of companies toward an omnichannel model using a common scientific forecasting method (i.e., the Delphi method) to identify trends and problems. In this scenario of high complexity and uncertainty where there is insufficient relevant quantitative information for decision making, the Delphi method is applied to ensure a consensual decision-making process. Consensus was reached by a panel of 11 experts on the Spanish ophthalmology sector after three rounds of questioning. The final set of indicators involve 19 different criteria grouped into four categories (1) current situation of the distribution channel, (2) changes in distribution channels, (3) trends and near future of the distribution channel, and (4) consequences and adaptations for supply chain agents. The results from each round of consultation were then analyzed by means of statistical analysis with SPSS and discussed for each category. The results confirm that traditional intermediaries face difficulties to avoid being squeezed out of the sector because of shortening distribution channels and the entry of new online intermediaries with service integration models. We identify future scenarios and define actions that different agents can take to enhance their competitiveness in the short and long term. The arrival of omnichannel distribution is inevitable in the ophthalmology sector, entailing a major transformation from a rigid traditional distribution model to a more complex and flexible model following the entry of new online intermediaries. © Copyright © 2020 Rivero Gutiérrez and Samino García.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086576599&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2020.01142&partnerID=40&md5=6b42ae8976ae8fa1f6a3c0a5bc9c4a53,Scopus

The aim of this work is to determine quantitatively the level of strategic fit of Italian companies from different sectors (e.g. automotive, rubber and plastics, fashion and apparel and machineries and equipment). To achieve our goal, we built a multiple-choice questionnaire with 11 questions on a company's supply chain and 9 questions on its products, to determine products characteristics and supply chain priorities. Also, the questionnaire is provided with some general questions to describe the characteristics of the company. The questionnaire was sent to around 2,000 companies, and we received 172 answers.

Being able to fully understand both the complex static and dynamic structures of a complex adaptive supply network (CASN) are key to being able to make more informed management decisions and prioritize resources and production throughout the network. Previous efforts to model and analyze CASN have been impeded by the complex, dynamic nature of the systems. However, drawing from other complex adaptive systems sciences, information theory provides a model-free methodology removing many of those barriers, especially concerning complex network structure and dynamics. With minimal information about the network nodes, transfer entropy can be used to reverse engineer the network structure while local transfer entropy can be used to analyze the network structure's dynamics. Both simulated and real-world networks were analyzed using this methodology. Applying the methodology to CASNs allows the practitioner to capitalize on observations from the highly multidisciplinary field of information theory which provides insights into CASN's self-organization, emergence, stability/instability, and distributed computation.

First, sustainability has become a necessary goal for businesses and a powerful strategy for competitive advantage. Sustainable innovations along the supply chain are increasingly important regarding firm competitiveness to respond to rapid changes in the market. Secondly, disruptive innovations are particularly adopted by firms, because they aim to provide product or process to a new set of customers (or customers with new sets of requirements). Big data and predictive analytics are one of them and may have the ability to generate considerably more business and social value while significantly reducing the use of scarce resources. This disruptive innovation could improve the ability to help with the sustainability of sourcing decisions, and reduce environmental footprint are increasingly recognized. Thirdly, developing dynamic capabilities such as absorptive capacity both in firms and in supply chains are also integral to responding to dynamic markets and customer needs. Dynamic capabilities are collective resources (financial and technical assets coordinated with knowledge and competencies) which are essentially change-oriented, helping firms redeploy and reconfigure. Any innovation (whether process or product oriented) must then rely on such capabilities. The main objective of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework through a literature review, to identify the features of disruptive innovations applied to the sustainable supply chain, and to analyze the role of dynamic capabilities. We will focus on how certain dynamic capabilities such as absorptive capacity affect the impact of the utilization of big data analytics on sustainable supply chain on frugal processes, which has not been investigated in depth. © 2017 DEStech Publications.

Once the future business scenario has been chosen, the KPI values associated with this scenario will become the new KPI values of the BSC in order to align efforts and save resources Further, the strategic objectives associated with the KPIs may also be extensively retuned, thus redefining their target values. From the application carried out, there were four KPIs whose values needed, in absolute terms, to be increased and four other KPIs to be decreased. Additionally, the associated strategic objectives were retuned; for example, the value of the strategic objective “To reduce product development costs” was initially set in the BSC at 10 % but it was deduced to 8% as a consequence of the application of the proposal.

Strategies for disruption management include flexibility and redundancy. This paper aims to analyse a supply chain disruption from flexibility and capacity perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: A case study was conducted of the supply chain disruption caused by the port conflict in 2016–2017 in Gothenburg, in which the port operated at a reduced capacity. Companies importing and exporting goods, freight forwarders, hauliers, train operators, ports, shipping companies and their agents were interviewed. Findings: Various capacity problems (ports, links, container chassis, empty containers) were encountered due to the port conflict. Flexibility measures such as node, mode and fleet flexibility can be used in response to changes in capacity. Difficulties with applying flexibility are discussed. Research limitations/implications: Although based on a Swedish case, findings are relevant for disruptions or other types of disturbances in ports elsewhere and also in other important nodes in companies' supply chains. Practical implications: Actors influenced by disturbances in a port can increase their understanding of potential capacity problems and flexibility measures. Readiness and timely action are important due to competition regarding capacity. Originality/value: The implications on the transport network surrounding a port, including many actors, are explained, illustrating how capacity problems propagate, but there is some flexibility to manage the problems. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125801921&doi=10.1108%2fIJLM-03-2020-0123&partnerID=40&md5=731ff3da4e60248b5bbc10c1ec87f63f,Scopus

Built upon a synthesis of the existing literature and relevant theories, this paper presents a research model that defines the drivers, strategy, and practices of a responsive supply chain and the performance outcomes. This paper is one of the rare empirical studies that identify key variables relevant to the implementation of a successful responsive supply chain. The effective implementation of a responsive supply chain requires a careful definition of a responsive supply chain strategy in terms of the product range, and the frequency and innovativeness of the product offerings. Firms also need to provide key implementation practices (i.e.; sharing of information with customers, collaboration with suppliers, use of advanced manufacturing technology) to achieve pull production to achieve responsiveness to the market. This study also suggests that the key contextual factors that influence the extent of implementation of a responsive supply chain strategy are mostly the size of firms, industry characteristics, and customer and supplier bases, rather than the location of manufacturing firms.

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are useful to enhance such network capabilities thorough effective information flows. Their intended goals are measured in terms of production costs, operational flexibility and supply chain performance outcomes. However, the impact of ERP system implementation on firm performance has been reported as somewhat inconclusive. This study contends that a missing link in the story is the scope and extent of ERP system implementation after investigating how the extent of ERP integration is associated with the performance outcomes of manufacturing firms. The study also posits that restructuring in the organisation and supply chains are positively associated with manufacturing performance. Since ERP often entails restructuring in an organisation and supply chains, it is anticipated that restructuring plays an important role in inducing positive impact of ERP implementation to the firm. Using a global sample of 641 manufacturers, this research identifies four distinct ERP systems integration patterns, epitomised by different extents and directions of integration, and finds a significant association among the broadest degree of ERP systems integration, restructuring and plant performance improvement. The empirical results also show that restructuring takes place most actively in a firm that implement ERP with widest scope and scale. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84933279432&doi=10.1080%2f09537287.2014.950624&partnerID=40&md5=b33996678a41ed1d0bf7f808527dd11d,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: Hypothesised relationships are tested with survey data from 302 Spanish manufacturing firms using structural equations modelling. Findings: Environmental dynamism is positively associated with both OAC and OL, and both dynamic capabilities enable SCF. The authors also find that the relationship between environmental dynamism and SCF is partially mediated by both dynamic capabilities.

This paper explores the influence of ambidexterity on supply chain flexibility (SCF) and theorizes the moderating effect of information technology (IT) competence on that relationship. Whereas prior research focuses on the positive results of SCF for business performance, little empirical research has studied its facilitators, leaving the gap this study seeks to fill. We draw on resource orchestration theory to develop our research model. According to this theory, a firm can exploit the full potential of its resources and capabilities only when these are deployed in a complementary manner. This study proposes that ambidexterity impacts SCF positively and that its effect is amplified when the firm possesses IT competence. In order to test our hypotheses we have employed a hierarchical regression methodology and put into service data collected from manufacturing enterprises. The study confirms that ambidexterity, as the ability to explore and exploit SC resources, enables their orchestration, making SC resources flexible, and a high IT competence facilitates that orchestration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079384205&doi=10.1016%2fj.pursup.2020.100610&partnerID=40&md5=a026f420adff940f68541235a2de29ac,Scopus

Further, to evaluate the influence of implementing the ISO 9001 standard on the relationship between ASCS and SCF, and whether this certification directly affects the level of SCF. We ground our model in Resource Orchestration theory. Design/methodology/approach: To perform this study, the authors used data collected from a sample of 145 non-ISO-certified firms and 157 ISO-certified firms. Findings: ASCS does not affect all four dimensions of SCF in the same way. Rather, its effect is contingent on the presence of the ISO 9001 certification. An ASCS is shown to have a positive effect on information system flexibility irrespective of the presence of ISO 9001 certification whereas for the other three dimensions of SCF, the effect of ASCS is dependent on ISO 9001 implementation. Meanwhile, ISO 9001 implementation itself does not affect the level of SCF. Practical implications: Managers can use the findings to configure their supply chain strategy based on the specific dimension(s) of SCF they seek to develop by implementing ASCS. Further, the results inform managers about the incentives for implementing ISO 9001. Originality/value: Although prior studies have shown that an ambidextrous strategy enables firms and organizational units to adapt to the environment, there have been few prior studies on ambidexterity in a supply chain context. Further, although the extant literature has suggested that the ISO 9001 may facilitate ambidexterity, this link has remained largely theoretical.

By developing a Stackelberg game analytical framework and designing different scenarios, we deduce the stakeholder’s optimal solutions in each case and compare them to evaluate the impact of manufacturer altruistic preferences and government subsidies on the multinational green supply chain under dynamic tariff. Then we show that: (i) with the increasing tariff rates, either altruistic preferences or government subsidies can promote the green supply chain. (ii) No matter what strategy adopts in the supply chain, it is beneficial to the retailer while harmful to the manufacturer with altruistic preference. (iii) Government subsidies or altruism preferences will lead to free-riding, but the former is conducive to the stable supply chain. (iv) Compared with the production cost subsidy, the green R&D subsidy encourages the green level, but the former contributes to increasing the participant profits. (v) Subsidies and altruistic preference, which simultaneously work in the supply chain, will further boost the greening but aggravate the manufacturer's loss and destroy the supply chain stability. To further enhance the green level and the participant revenue, we also propose the contracts of two-part tariff and profit-sharing to coordinate the supply chain. Lastly, we perform a comparative analysis of the different scenarios utilizing numerical examples and formulate managerial insights accordingly. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106434809&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-021-01514-w&partnerID=40&md5=78bb9471e571f9fbb627889171897b49,Scopus

In generalized terms, we contribute to the understanding of the effect of preparedness and recovery decisions in a pandemic setting on supply chain operations and performance. In particular, we examine the impact of inventory pre-positioning in anticipation of a pandemic and the adaptation of production-ordering policy during the pandemic. Our model combines three levels, which is not often seen jointly in operations management literature, i.e., pandemic dynamics, supply chain design, and operational production-inventory control policies. The analysis is performed for both two- and three-stage supply chains and different scenarios for pandemic dynamics (i.e., uncontrolled propagation or controlled dispersal with lockdowns). Our findings suggest that two-stage supply chains exhibit a higher vulnerability in disruption cases. However, they are exposed to a lower system inertia and show positive effects at the recovery stage. Supply chain adaptation ahead of a pandemic is more advantageous than during the pandemic when specific operational recovery policies are deployed. We show that it is instructive to avoid simultaneous changes in structural network design and operational policies since that can destabilize the production-inventory system and result in higher product shortages. © 2022",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126106729&doi=10.1016%2fj.omega.2022.102635&partnerID=40&md5=a7d6d2fc8cf2c25c422a0b6c5ffd33c9,Scopus

Material efficiency strategies such as recycling serve to reduce these emissions.

We present a dynamic supply chain simulation model for copper through 2040 incorporating inventory-driven price evolution, dynamic material flow analysis, and life cycle assessment alongside mine-level economic evaluation of opening, closing, and production decisions. We show that permanent increases in recycling displace ∼0.5 kilotonnes mine production per kilotonne increase in scrap supply on average, while short-lived recycling policies can lead to increased mine production. We find evidence for supply chain evolution pathways minimizing the rebound effect and maximizing displacement of primary material, where increasing refined copper and concentrate prices and decreasing demand serve to decrease mining. However, even in best-case scrap supply scenarios, CO2e emissions from the copper sector increase 25% by 2040 relative to 2018 due to demand growth, ore grade decline, and lower displacement among large scrap supply changes. With implementation of best available technologies across all supply chain components, we estimated 2040 CO2e emissions 10% below those of 2018 are possible, though still well short of 2°C emissions targets. We find increasing mine taxes and royalties, reclamation costs, and exploration costs further increase displacement, as does the inclusion of scrap prices on major futures exchanges.

Dynamic and complex supply chain environments have constantly led companies to modern management approaches such as resilience to address disruptions. Besides, the sustainability approach enhances the strength of the supply chain in disruptions by considering economic, social, and environmental aspects. This paper develops a mathematical model for designing a supply chain network considering resilience and sustainability. In this model, suppliers were exposed to disruption with different probabilities. The model has three objectives: minimizing total costs and maximizing suppliers' social and environmental scores. A robust scenario-based stochastic programming approach has been used for potential disruption scenarios. The multiobjective model is solved by the ϵ-constraint method in GAMS software. The numerical results show the performance of the model in a different situation. Also, the robust scenario-based stochastic programming approach allows the average performance of the supply chain in each objective to improve. © 2021 Zahra Sadeghi et al.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118938079&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f9975071&partnerID=40&md5=e58ac1f600c5b7c043d8e652501ecaea,Scopus

Nowadays, due to increased uncertainty in customer demand, it is necessary to be sure that the supply chain networks operate as efficient as possible in order to satisfy the customer demand at the lowest cost. Enhancing the efficiency of the supply chain necessitates the interaction between different members of the supply chain which can be achieved through supply chain management. Hence, the development of modeling approach in order to understand and analyze the dynamic behavior of supply chains is brought into consideration. This paper proposes a system dynamic simulation model for manufacturing supply chain. System dynamic is used as suitable method to understand and analyze the interactions of various components via feedback structure. The objective of this paper is to simulate the manufacturing supply chain of an electronic manufacturing company in Malaysia. The simulation model is used to study the system's behavior (in terms of production rate, inventory levels, and backlog orders) under two different operational conditions (named as fixed and varied capacity policies) and compare their efficiency in terms of total cost. The analysis shows that the proposed operational condition, which is varied capacity policy, improves the system efficiency in terms of cost. © 2014 Penerbit UTM Press.

Flexibility is therefore a key logistics issue in distribution centre management. This study probes into the nature of warehouse flexibility in a supply network through simulation. Design/methodology/approach: By using the FlexSim simulation tool the dynamic behaviour of the warehouse system are conceptualised, documented, simulated, analysed and evaluated. Findings: Simulation revealed that external changes affect daily processes and the reorganisation of warehouse processes. Given the extensity of resource use, simulation also revealed that process reorganisation should not be a daily undertaking. This is because warehouse processes react in unpredictable and different manners to even the smallest disturbance from the environment. This reaction is not necessarily negative impending more long-term change of warehouse processes. Originality/value: The warehouse is a complex system that self-adapts with limited need to calculate new optimised warehouse processes to counter changes in its environment. Rather than following deterministic optimisation procedures, the development of flexible resources is a key issue in warehouse management. The applied simulation model is generic and therefore applicable in other distribution centres pointing to how to monitor warehouse processes to in a pre-emptively develop warehouse flexibility through change of process context. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106228066&doi=10.1108%2fIJPPM-05-2020-0250&partnerID=40&md5=733d06d0912bae64321fc57df14adbf6,Scopus

The gravity model of international trade is applied to examine the hypothesized impact of maritime network reconfiguration on the bilateral trade between nine exporting countries (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia) and their 128 trading partners. The panel data on the five components of the Liner Shipping Bilateral Connectivity Index, the export value, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the nine exporting countries, the GDP of their trading partners and the maritime distance linking them to these 128 trading partners for each of the years from 2008 to 2016 are used in the analysis. The results show that the estimated coefficient for the number of transhipments is negative, revealing an inverse relationship between transhipments and bilateral exports, reconfirming that a redesign of the maritime supply chain network in response to the BRI could significantly improve bilateral export values. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of required transhipments, because of a reconfiguration of maritime networks with BRI trading partners, will improve the maritime network structure between countries located along the three strategic chokepoints: the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, and the Strait of Malacca. In general terms, the BRI-driven reconfiguration of maritime supply networks is linked to an improvement in the productivity of nine exporting countries. An innovative gravity-based econometric model, estimated on a large set of panel data, is introduced below, aiming at the modelling of the effect of BRI on supply chain network reconfiguration. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105396735&doi=10.1057%2fs41278-021-00192-9&partnerID=40&md5=85b5ec981b7a2e2f535f181ea9adef4d,Scopus

Winning customer satisfaction is one of the primary elements of survival in the market. Organizations are no longer committed to long-term cooperation with suppliers. Furthermore, choosing suppliers is only based on their qualifications with regard to providing service and their compatibility with the type of customers' demands. Thus, each supply network needs to be designed according to a specific market opportunity with regard to structure and members. As a result, the structure of supply networks must be more flexible and move toward dynamics (Humphries and Mena, 2012) [2]. Delivery time is one of the main criteria for evaluating the performance of a supply network. Delivery speed and accuracy in dynamic supply networks are the main challenges ahead of network managers due to the short-time nature of such networks (da Silveira and Arkader, 2007) [3]. Therefore, from a different viewpoint, uncertainty and its sources, which directly affect delivery time, could not be ignored easily. Therefore, this study essentially focuses on the impact of uncertainty on delivery time in three nodes supply networks. The aim of this paper is to identify the impact of the accumulation of the individual delivery time uncertainties on overall delivery time uncertainty. The idea is the type of network and their structures have a crucial impact on the delivery time uncertainty. To prove this idea a probabilistic method is created to measure and evaluate this influence by implementing the Markov theorem. This research is an important step toward the better understanding of more complex networks and the impact of network type in the delivery time uncertainty of these networks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States","To increase resilience in supply chains, we investigate the optimal design of flexibility in a backup system. We model the dynamics of disruptions as Markov chains, and consider a multiproduct, multisupplier supply chain under dynamic disruption risks. Using our model, we first show that a little flexibility in the backup system can go a long way in mitigating dynamic disruption risks. This raises an important and fundamental question in designing flexibility in the backup system: to achieve the benefits of full backup flexibility, which unreliable suppliers should be backed up? To answer this question, we connect the supply chain to various queueing and dam models by analyzing the dynamics of the inventory shortfall process. Using this connection, we show that backing up suppliers merely based on first moment considerations such as their average reliability or average product demand can be misleading. All else equal, it is better to back up suppliers with (1) longer but less frequent disruptions, and (2) lower demand uncertainty. In addition to such second moment effects, by employing the Renyi's Theorem, we demonstrate that when disruptions are relatively long (if they occur), backing up the suppliers for which the expected wasted backup capacity is minimum provides the best backup flexibility design. We also develop easy-to-compute and yet effective indices that (a) guide the supply chain designer in deciding which suppliers to backup, and (b) provide insights into the role of various factors such as inventory holding and shortage costs, purchasing costs, suppliers reliabilities, and product demand distributions in designing backup flexibility. © 2016 INFORMS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964687608&doi=10.1287%2fopre.2016.1478&partnerID=40&md5=b3eaf4117b1434e50e606a9b02a30e09,Scopus

Inbound logistics is a vital step in warehouse receiving process and has a direct impact on supply chain cost and performance. As a result of an inefficient check-in operation, the incoming trucks may experience inordinate wait times between arrival and check-in, which in turn leads to unnecessary cost to the company in the form of detention fees (a penalty for holding the truck and driver beyond the agreed upon time) and delayed delivery of subsequent consignments.

Design/methodology/approach – The research methodology consists of two stages: configuration of a conceptual framework of integrated supply chain model linked with performance measures and illustration of the integrated supply chain model and delivery performance using a case of dairy industry. The integrated supply chain model is based on a unitary structuring technique and forms the basis for measuring and evaluating supply chain performance. Delivery performance with variation of demand (forecast and actual) is monitored using a fuzzy-based decision support system, based on three inputs: capacity utilization (influenced by production disruption), raw materials shortage and quality of dairy products. Findings – Integration of supply chain components (materials, resources, operations, activities, suppliers, etc.) of key processes using unitary structuring approach enables information integration in real time for performance evaluation and monitoring in complex supply chain situations. In addition, real-time performance monitoring is recognized as being of great importance for supply chain management in responding to uncertainties inherent in the operational environment. Research limitations/implications – Implementation of an integrated model requires maintenance of supply chain components with all necessary data and information in a system environment such as enterprise resource planning. Practical implications – The integrated model provides decision-makers with an overall view of supply chain components and direct links that need to be maintained for supply chain performance evaluation and monitoring. Wider adaptation and diffusion of the proposed model require further validation of the model and feasibility of implementation, using real-time data and information on selected performance measures.

Cost saving and capacity flexibility depend on the connection between product characteristics and the supply chain network. Functional products involve efficient supply chains. Fashion products should move in the production and distribution system as quickly as possible in which maximum capacity flexibility provides a responsive supply chain. Moreover, complex products with global parts sourcing involve comparatively more risk. This paper evaluates an outsourcing strategies considering functional and fast fashion products in the textile supply chain. There are four categories of production options. Textile manufacturer receives production contracts at in-house facility in home country. Capacity flexibility is measured as the combination of destinations with maximum capacity. Product complexity risk is incorporated as the number of parts/components sourced domestically and internationally at each production destination. A multi-objective model for outsourcing strategiesis proposed based on operational cost, capacity flexibility, and product complexity risk. The model is solved using three variants of goal programming.

However, there is a paucity of literature that focuses on social sustainability issues for emerging economies. In the post-COVID-19 period, firms around the world will face several critical challenges to social sustainability, which will hinder achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Against this backdrop, this study identifies the pressing challenges to social sustainability in the post-COVID-19 context by a literature review and opinions from an expert panel, focusing on the footwear supply chain. In this paper, the best–worst method is applied to compute the criticality of social sustainability challenges towards the flexibility of the supply chains.

The resulting formulation could be used for deeper placement in wells. Traditionally, these have been viewed as technology limiters for lightweight cements. We screened local raw materials, cement available in Saudi Arabia. This in combination with carefully selected glass microspheres, have resulted in unique ultra-lightweight cement formulation. Careful selection of particle sizing and micro-Additives has resulted in better adhesion. This paper describes the formulation, lab test results, and structural properties found through use of x-ray diffraction analytical testing. Additionally, it shows a comparison among the various density formulations with different microspheres and additives. Success in formulating with locally available ingredients improves supply chain flexibility - often a key in successful operations. Our results show nearly double the mechanical strength expected from a lightweight formulation lower than water density. Systematic approach considered during fluid optimization. The Paper will highlight the improved crush resistance of the beads and summarize the robust laboratory tests performed to qualify it for applications in a wide variety of challenging down-hole conditions including lost circulations and weak formations. Due to more predictable downhole density, complete circulation can be achieved deploying this slurry. The set cement mechanical properties, including compressive strength, have significantly improved which is essential for ensuring long-Term isolation. Conventional water-extended cement slurries are not considered adequate to isolate unconventional reservoirs such as shale and tight sandstone. We believe this formulation discovery, when further optimized, could be the basis of high-performance lightweight cement systems that are capable of deeper placement in the wells with improved pumpability and on-location rheology and set time control.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce an alternative where DDM coexists with and complements traditional mass production. When multiple parts run across one manufacturing line, DDM can isolate variability associated with low volume part production and may be preferred to mass production despite being expensive. If DDM complements rather than cannibalizes mass production, this alters the understanding of who adopts DDM, the products built with DDM, and DDM’s long-term supply chain implications. Design/methodology/approach – This invited paper explores a DDM rollout scenario and qualitatively assesses potential supply chain reconfigurations. Findings – The analysis recognizes that existing manufacturers with heterogeneous bills-of-material may develop DDM capabilities to isolate disruptive, low-volume production from scalable mass production. Developing DDM competence and raw material scale advantages, these manufacturers become the locus of change in a manufacturing landscape increasingly characterized by multi-product DDM supercenters. Originality/value – Extant research largely focusses on two potential reasons for DDM adoption: cost-per-unit and time-to-delivery comparisons. The authors explore a third driver: DDM’s capacity to isolate manufacturing variability attributable to low volume parts. Relative to the extant literature, this suggests a different DDM rollout, different adopters, and a different supply chain configuration. The authors identify mass manufacturing variability reduction as the mechanism through which DDM may be adopted. This adoption trajectory would eventually enable a supply chain transition in which spare parts inventory migrates from finished goods at proprietary facilities to raw materials at generalized DDM supercenters. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84955490272&doi=10.1108%2fIJPDLM-10-2015-0257&partnerID=40&md5=4c3fdf238ae77c7d7a0b59f0a1ff0ab9,Scopus

Given that rapid globalization has increased supply disruption risk, managers have been forced to establish efficient and responsive supply chain strategies. Nevertheless, diverse uncertainty factors, such as risk perception of strategies, have made practical management difficult. Quantifying managers' risk perceptions and applying them to supply chain strategies allows the authors to propose a structural and practical model for managing supply disruption. Design/methodology/approach: The existing structural model is refined by taking subjective factors into account using the analytic hierarchy process. The applicability of the refined model is demonstrated through a comparative case study. Findings: Managers' risk perceptions vary not only among companies but also between managing divisions within a company, which necessitates possible changes in strategy due to environmental turbulence. The principal component analysis (PCA) characterizes managers' risk perceptions that illustrate companies' emphases on disruption risk. Practical implications: The proposed approach quantifies risk perception, which enables practitioners to deal with subjective information in quantitative form. Comparative studies clarify differences in perception given different business backgrounds. The results provide managers with in-depth insights for establishing supply chain strategies reflecting their risk perception. Originality/value: Quantification of managers' subjective risk perception clarifies both the trend and the individual features for uncertainties. The results allow the authors to conduct the PCA, which characterizes companies. Comparative studies generalize the results of extant work, shedding light on cross-sectional differences given different business backgrounds. The effectiveness of the approach is confirmed through retrospective interviews with practitioners. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089455212&doi=10.1108%2fIMDS-01-2020-0049&partnerID=40&md5=308a801f7dfa9600e5e8c3863d9a04a0,Scopus

Our framework combines time series modeling with process charts to identify abnormal flow patterns in the incoming supply streams. It is a flexible framework that uses off-the-shelf technology to provide managers with a process that can be employed for monitoring multiple individual or aggregated data streams originating within any complex system such as complex adaptive supply networks. We illustrate our framework on four years of longitudinal supply data from the second largest food bank in the United States.

This makes them open and vulnerable to the rapidly changing ICT threat landscape and many ports are not yet fully prepared for that. Furthermore, these supply chains represent a highly interrelated cyber ecosystem, in which a plethora of distributed ICT systems of various business partners interact with each other. Due to these interrelations, isolated threats and vulnerabilities within a system of a single business partner may propagate and have cascading effects on multiple other systems, thus resulting in a large-scale impact on the whole supply chain. In this context, this article proposes a novel evidence-driven risk assessment methodology, i.e., the MITIGATE methodology, to analyze the risk level of the whole maritime supply chain. This methodology builds upon publicly available information, well-defined mathematical approaches and best practices to automatically identify and assess vulnerabilities and potential threats of the involved cyber assets. As a major benefit, the methodology provides a constantly updated risk evaluation not only of all cyber assets within each business partner in the supply chain but also of the cyber interconnections among those business partners. Additionally, the whole process is based on qualitative risk scales, which makes the assessment as well as the results more intuitive.

It is imperative that logistic key performance indicators (KPIs) be considered along with product costs and product quality to obtain a competitive advantage. Numerous companies possess an internal supply chain that fails to meet logistic performance goals set by the management. The measurables for logistic performance include logistic KPIs such as delivery time as well as cost relevant figures including work-in-process or the utilization of employees. In a case of unsatisfactory logistic KPIs, it is pertinent to identify the root causes before attempting to rectify the situation. Increasing digitalization within industry means a substantial volume of confirmation data is available regarding the core processes of a company's internal supply chain. This study discloses a model-based analysis of confirmation data to identify the root causes of unsatisfactory logistic KPIs. A framework for the analysis is constructed by defining generic cause-and-effect relationships between the relevant logistic KPIs and influencing as well as disturbing factors. The results produced by the model-based analysis and the interpretation of the confirmation data show the occurring cause-and-effect relationships for particular use cases and deduce the root causes for insufficient logistic KPIs. From there, companies can develop and implement suitable steps to increase the logistic KPIs by focusing on the newly-identified root causes instead of non-related, but recurring, complications. A case study is included to show the practicality of the presented method. The root cause analysis provides the basis for advanced logistics controlling systems to automatically identify weak-points and propose counteractive measures and therefore continuously improve and adapt the supply chain to changing conditions. © 2019 The Authors.

Expediting, an adaptive ordering approach often used to mitigate disruptions, can trigger unintended bullwhip effects, and hurt rather than help overall performance. As an alternative to expediting interventions, dynamic order-up-to policies show promise as an adaptive mitigation tool. We also find benefits in the dynamic policies from incorporating a metaheuristic parameter search over multiple echelons, yielding significantly better solution quality than embedded unimodal search. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994383070&doi=10.1016%2fj.omega.2016.07.004&partnerID=40&md5=68a90e60128bad46c73cac2f5ddef390,Scopus

We do so in the present research and posit that supply chain intelligence, defined as technological and competitive knowledge sourced and integrated from suppliers, customers, and competitors, plays an important role in explaining new product launch success. We further employ the knowledge-based view to theorize that both supply chain adaptability and product innovation capability act as important mediators of the effects of supply chain intelligence on new product launch success and firm financial performance. While the former capability refers to a firm's ability to quickly adjust its supply chain to react to market and product design changes, the latter refers to the firm's proficiency in developing innovative new products. We test hypothesized relationships among these factors utilizing data collected in a survey of 229 U.S. manufacturing firms. Results point to the central role of supply chain adaptability in capturing the benefits of supplier technological intelligence for enhanced product innovation capability, new product launch success, and firm financial performance. In contrast, product innovation capability serves as the generative means by which customer and competitor intelligence is translated into more successful new product launches, which, in turn, produce superior firm financial performance. Overall, these findings contribute to a better understanding of factors that can explain why certain product launches are more successful than others, and offer practical insights for appropriate investments in the development of related knowledge resources. © 2015 Decision Sciences Institute.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943813671&doi=10.1111%2fdeci.12163&partnerID=40&md5=4d89d1b182aa603d4ac15f8b33a2d987,Scopus

Roughly speaking, stability of these networks implies that the total number of customers/jobs in the network remains bounded over time. In this context robustness characterizes the ability of a multiclass queueing network to remain stable, if the expected values of the interarrival and service times distributions are subject to uncertain shifts. A powerful starting point for the stability analysis of multiclass queueing networks is the associated fluid network. Based on the fluid network analysis we present a measure to quantify the robustness, which is indicated by a single number. This number will be called the stability radius. It represents the magnitude of the smallest shift of the expected value of the interarrival and/or service times distributions so that the associated fluid network looses the property of stability. The stability radius is a worst case measure and is a conceptual adaptation from the dynamical systems literature. Moreover, we provide a characterization of the shifts that destabilize the network. Based on these results, we formulate a mathematical program that minimizes the required network capacity, while ensuring a desired level of robustness towards shifts of the expected values of the interarrival times distributions.

In addition, the paper describes how business size affects these issues. The survey results show that, at the time of this study, many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and a number of larger firms were unaware of REACH. Survey results consistently showed that the size of a company is an important factor in both understanding of and compliance with REACH, with respondents from large firms having a better grasp of REACH and its implications than smaller companies. An effective implementation of REACH will require, at the most basic level, more attention to educating EU companies, especially smaller ones, on how and why REACH applies to them. Survey respondents who were aware of REACH and its applicability to their firms also reported the types of support they needed in order to better understand and comply with the regulation, with nearly 40% of all respondents expressing a need for help with data systems or tools to manage REACH requirements and communicate REACH requirements to suppliers and customers.

Farmer investment in wood production and the degree of formality in the sector depends on access to and conditions of the market, the nature of the regulatory frameworks that govern rights to and movement of timber, and access to financing. We evaluate the process of formalization of a thriving and adaptive existing supply chain for small-dimension lumber originating in the fallows of smallholder farmers in the Peruvian Amazon. Through field research over three years based in semi-structured interviews with diverse actors in the Amazon, we found that the supply chain for fallow timber is driven entirely by informal and some illegal transactions. A key reason for this is the lack of an appropriate regulatory mechanism by which producers can gain authorization to harvest and sell this timber. We identify conditions necessary to formalize this sector, and evaluate the degree to which these are met under several scenarios. We recommend that the state develop mechanisms that recognize property rights of long-term residents and establish a simple fallow forestry registration mechanism; and that local governments or non-governmental organizations adopt adaptive and collaborative approaches to support farmers and provide training, information and networking among actors. State recognition of and support for fallow forestry, coupled with producers organizing for collective action on processing and marketing their timber, could result in the formalization of a significant volume of timber, improvements in income security for rural people, and the development of local entrepreneurial activities. © Copyright © 2021 Sears, Cronkleton, Miranda Ruiz and Pérez-Ojeda del Arco.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112331155&doi=10.3389%2fffgc.2021.681611&partnerID=40&md5=0b07d5c601eb08f02afaa9658a84c18a,Scopus

Product flexibility is the possibility to produce several kinds of products from one predecessor product. Process flexibility is the possibility to use one production process to manufacture several products. In order to increase the accuracy and robustness of delivery dates, we develop an order promising methodology able to deal with demand mix uncertainty and heterogeneous customer order lead times. The approach anticipates changes in production plans made possible by product and process flexibilities. In a numerical study based on a case from the semiconductor industry, we demonstrate that our method increases the accuracy and robustness of order promises.

These disperse suppliers are exposed to multiple unforeseen natural and manmade risks and vulnerabilities (Simchi-Levi et al. 2014; Zsidisin et al. 2004). One of the consequences of exposure to manmade and natural risks is supply chain disruption (Schmidt and Raman 2012; Zsidisin et al. 2004). Therefore, the risks and vulnerabilities faced by the supply chain of large enterprises have made them to focus on monitoring supply chain risks and preparing their organizations to be resilient enough to come back after a significant disruption. Supply chain risk is defined as “any risks for the information, material and product flows from the original supplier to the delivery of the final product for the end user” (Jüttner et al. 2003), and resilience is defined as “the capacity for an enterprise to survive, adapt, and grow in the face of turbulent change” (Fiksel 2006). Based on the systems theory, two types of resilience are identified. They are inherent resilience and adaptive resilience (Buikstra et al. 2010). But the third type of resilience, anticipated resilience, is also recognized as essential, which is the company’s ability to continually innovate and be prepared for any adverse effects (Hamel and Valikangas 2003). All three resiliencies are necessary for the continuity of business after a disaster. Apart from this, companies have also realized the importance of transparency or visibility of inherent vulnerabilities of the firm to which a supply chain is exposed to (Kleindorfer and Saad 2005). This work-in-progress paper is based on the data collected from a major supplier in the United States. It focuses on addressing the question, “how does anticipated, inherent and adaptive resilience, as well as supply chain visibility, influence business continuity programs?” The contingent resource-based theory (Brandon-Jones et al. 2014) is employed to establish and explain the relationship among inherent resilience, anticipated resilience, adaptive resilience, supply chain visibility in performance, and business continuity. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125263793&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-39165-2_241&partnerID=40&md5=63e19e642e0eea477c7da5b219d8a31f,Scopus

We argue that overcoming satisficing biases may require Indian SMEs to strive for strategic flexibility that allow for prompt adjustments in value creation activities. A higher strategic flexibility allows SMEs in the manufacturing sector to rapidly adjust product range, variety, innovativeness, and speed of development to capitalize on new opportunities and minimize the negative impact of changing market conditions.

Case overview/synopsis: This case visualizes the planning of supply chain drivers and process improvement to enhance supply chain speed and flexibility. Asim Rizvi has recently joined as senior supply chain manager at Food Lord, a renowned chain of restaurants in Pakistan. As instructed by his CEO, Rizvi has to take a decision for centralization, or to continue the decentralization of supply chain operations at two of their highest selling branches. These two branches were located at a distance of 125 km from each other. The objective of supply chain operations’ consolidation was to minimize cost and further improve the service level. Rizvi was confused about the decision because any decision cannot be taken on the basis of cost and benefit analysis only. A 360-degree analysis and future requirements also play a vital role to decide about supply chain operations. The CEO was very excited to take this decision; that is why newly hired manager Rizvi was analyzing all the facts to reach a decision that would be best for their business. Centralized or decentralized supply chain decision was not easy because normally the business dynamics completely change due to unpredictable customer demand, unavailability of professional suppliers and unavailability of a strong information system, etc. Complexity academic level: BBA and MBA Supplementary materials: Teaching notes are available for educators only.

Based on the survey data of 510 Chinese enterprises, this paper adopts the hierarchical regression analysis and a structural equation model to study the impact of supply chain collaborative innovation on the sustainable development of supply chains. The results show that: (1) Three modes of supply chain collaborative innovation (namely, technology collaborative innovation, management collaborative innovation, and market collaborative innovation) have different effects on supply chain dynamic capability and sustainable supply chain performance. (2) Supply chain dynamic capability plays a significant intermediary role between supply chain collaborative innovation and sustainable supply chain performance. (3) Supply chain technology collaborative innovation has the greatest direct impact on sustainable supply chain performance, followed by supply chain management collaborative innovation. However, the direct effect of supply chain market collaborative innovation on sustainable supply chain performance is not significant; under the intermediary role of dynamic capability, supply chain market collaborative innovation has a significant indirect effect on sustainable supply chain performance. © 2020 by the authors.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083581797&doi=10.3390%2fsu12072978&partnerID=40&md5=7d8a2b0bd01c3c1d62efa93c6d5295b0,Scopus

The present study aims to reconfigure the existing food grain supply chain network. The study advances the extant literature by proposing a novel mathematical model that considers the government guidelines issued to procure food grains from farmers under the COVID-19 situation. The model includes personal distancing, a key parameter relevant in the COVID-19 crisis, and has remained unaddressed in the existing literature. The proposed model is tested in India. The effect of different parameters like personal distancing cost, carbon emission cost, fixed cost, and transportation cost is also investigated under a given set of procurement centers. Finally, the procurement schedule for each procurement center is generated, which is especially useful for managing its activities and is also helpful to farmers to streamline the process. Results indicate that the proposed model is highly effective under pandemic emergencies like the current COVID-19 crisis. Policymakers and the government will find this model helpful in drafting relevant policies regarding food grain procurement under emergencies such as the COVID-19 outbreak. The distribution segment of the supply chain network is not part of the present research work.

With its ever-increasing population and the land size shrinking, food security poses one of the biggest threats. The economic growth has been tremendous over the past few years but, the country still struggles with widespread poverty and hunger. India ranks 129th on the Global Hunger Index (2015), released by IFPRI. Despite being a major agriculture player, India is home to 25% of the world's hungry population. The four parameters for analyzing Food Security are-Availability, Accessibility, Stability and Utility. Currently, the farmers are unawares about the demand and therefore, do not know how much to produce. If these questions are answered, millions could be unshackled from the deadly chains of hunger and malnutrition. The aim of this paper is to review how usage of big data in warehousing will enhance the accessibility of food. If the farmers are given a first-hand, timely and reliable information through information communication technology tools (ICT), a major chunk of the problem can be solved. Data on demand will enable efficient warehousing, a resilient and adaptable supply chain, and overall, help in paving the way for a better market integration. Big data analysis will provide the information in a usable form on how much to produce, store and distribute. Use of big data in warehousing will come to play and help in improving the accessibility of food aided by a zero-defect resilient supply chain.

Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual framework of the present study is developed by conducting an extensive literature review on blockchain technology, supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility and competitive advantage. The sample data were collected from 397 supply chain practitioners in India to validate the conceptual model. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to ascertain the validity of the measures used and a structural model was analyzed for testing the proposed conceptual framework. Findings: The results of the present study show that blockchain technology can improve supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility which lead to competitive advantage, which leads to better firm performance. Besides, trust generated through blockchain use also increases firm performance. Research limitations/implications: Currently, the respondents do not have practical experience of using blockchain technology. They have responded based on their knowledge about supply chain and blockchain which they acquired from published sources. Different supply chains require different strategic choices and different information needs. But the present study assumes that all supply chain needs are identical. The present study assumes that government regulations regarding blockchain technology are favorable; however, currently, there is no legal framework to address blockchain technology. The findings of the current study indicate that companies not only should create more awareness regarding blockchain but also should actively work with IT companies that are engaged in developing blockchain-based supply chain solution. Managers, as well as IT companies and academicians, should join hands to study and develop a framework for regulating blockchain technology and suggest these to the policy actors. Practical implications: The present study shows that supply chain practitioners are confident that blockchain technology will help improve supply chain parameters. These findings can help IT companies and their marketers for developing and promoting blockchain-based IT applications. In addition, the important implication for supply chain practitioners is that blockchain helps in creating a competitive advantage and increases firm performance.

We investigate the mechanism of government subsidy regulation on recycling enterprises' technology decisions, the optimal proportion of technology upgrades of recycling enterprises, and the effects of other exogenous factors on the decision of government and recycling enterprises in an early stage of the recycling industry. The results show that with the subsidy, the recycling enterprises' proportion of technology upgrade and profits is always improved. And recycling enterprise will actively increase investment to increase the proportion of technology upgrades. Furthermore, the government should prioritize assisting enterprises that are among the first to invest in recycling technology. Interestingly, the proportion of subsidy and technology upgrades is also affected by the unit environmental benefit and the degree of substitution of renewable products with different technological levels. When the degree of substitution is low, not only government subsidies are required to play a role but also builders' awareness of the benefits of using high-tech renewable products, in order to drive enterprise technology investment from the demand side.

Harnessing solar radiation holds the answer to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. It is the most abundant energy resource and could meet humans’ future energy needs. The efficient conversion of solar radiation into stable, energy-dense liquid energy carriers that can use existing or adapt global supply chains for storage, shipping, and distribution is the key to large-scale deployment of solar energy at gigaton levels. Liquid sunshine is the vision of combining the sun's energy with carbon dioxide and water to produce green liquid fuels. CO2 released on using these fuels is recycled back into the environment, thus maintaining an ecologically balanced cycle. Multi-source and multi-purpose alcohols are optimal candidate fuels. Methanol and ethanol are actionable first targets with gigaton production potential. The intertwined goals of economic growth, environmental conservation, and energy security (3E) are pressing global challenges of our time. The paper discusses solutions to 3E goals, particularly in the context of developing countries that are most affected by climate change and local environmental degradation. 3E goals call for “common man solutions”; cheap, clean energy that can help combat hazardous pollution threatening public health and break the mutually reinforcing downward spiral of human poverty and environmental degradation. Alcohols are clean, affordable, multi-source, multi-purpose fuels that can rise to the call. The liquid sunshine roadmap charts stepwise technology advancements from intermediate technologies such as natural gas renewable hybrid systems to green systems for methanol production entirely from renewable energy. Intermediate solutions such as hybrid alcohols build production capacity, establish downstream markets, and begin the adaptation of existing supply chain infrastructure for subsequent widespread market penetration of alcohols in the global energy market. Hybrid alcohols also provide the “breathing space” until green technologies reach maturity for commercial production of green alcohols. Looking ahead, green alcohols and electricity can function as the dual pillars of green energy systems, with alcohol reservoirs forming the backbone. Such green energy systems can support myriad applications and services to build a sustainable future. Replacing fossil fuels with renewables will require efficient carriers of the sun's energy at gigaton scale. The diagram illustrates an ecologically balanced cycle where green alcohols are produced by combining sunshine with CO2 and H2O drawn from the environment and returned to the environment.

In such networks, different delivery modes can significantly influence the efficiency of the entire supply chain. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for a multi-product four-stage flexible supply chain network design (SCND) problem in a solid transportation environment. The presented model considers three different delivery modes namely normal delivery, direct shipment and direct delivery. Since the problem is NP-hard, meta-heuristic approaches should be used to solve it. For this aim, ten classical and adaptive meta-heuristic algorithms are developed. In order to calibrate the parameters of the proposed algorithms, a typical experimental study is done. After the parameter setting stage, the final experiments on some randomly generated test problems are performed. The Obtained results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive vibration damping optimization (AVDO) algorithm performs better than the other algorithms. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073689866&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2019.106107&partnerID=40&md5=c535840f6ae5e0f9f60a0b284116701f,Scopus

Multiple agents such as data retrieval agent, knowledge acquisition agent, knowledge representation agent, configuration predictor agent, evaluator agent and dispatching agent are used to help execute a broad spectrum of SC configuration decisions. The proposed framework considers multiple product variants and sourcing options at each network node, as well as multiple performance objectives.

The currently dominant production platforms of pharmaceutical products, however, regard a mass production paradigm and are thus unfeasible for the production and provision of personalised medicines. The production platforms are not designed or are intended for a customisation context. Operating such a context with the current supply chain entails challenges such as increasing costs, time to patient and efforts in quality assurance activities. To address these challenges, this paper presents four reconfigured pharmaceutical supply chain designs. A qualitative operational performance assessment elicits the strengths and weaknesses of the respective supply chain design operating in a customisation context. The results suggest that a later point of variegation, that is, the point in the supply chain where the final customisation is achieved, can relieve the operational effort of the stakeholders in the supply chain while providing the benefits of personalised medicines, that is, an enhanced treatment outcome of the patient. A trade-off remains, however, between the supply chain’s decreased operational effort and degree of necessary reconfigurations, such as introducing new functions to stakeholder operation, reallocating activities to other stakeholders or educating stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2021.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103902738&doi=10.1177%2f1063293X211002169&partnerID=40&md5=84dda6277b2c4bfd4e42cac5d2fb1477,Scopus

While the role of safety stocks in coping with uncertainty is well studied, safety time has received only scarce attention in the supply chain management literature. Particularly, most previous operations research models have typically considered the use of such inventory buffers in a separate fashion, but not together. Here, we propose a decision support system (DSS) to address the problem of integrating optimal safety stock and safety time decisions at the component level, in multi-supplier multi-item single-stage industrial supply chains under dynamic demands and stochastic lead times. The DSS is based on a hybrid bi-objective optimization approach that simultaneously optimizes upstream inventory holding costs and β-service levels, suggesting multiple non-dominated Pareto-optimal solutions to decision-makers. We further explore a weighted closed-form analytical expression to select a single Pareto-optimal point from a set of non-dominated solutions, thereby enhancing the practical application of the proposed DSS. We describe the implementation of our approach in a major automotive electronics company operating under a myriad of components with dynamic demand, uncertain supply and requirements plans with different degrees of sparsity. We show the potential of our approach to improve β-service levels while minimizing inventory-related costs. The results suggest that, in certain cases, it appears to be more cost-effective to combine safety stock with safety time compared to considering each inventory buffer independently. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128333233&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2022.108095&partnerID=40&md5=eb4adbf0416abe05e0bde7569228fd9a,Scopus

Although research has made substantial contributions, there is a lack of understanding on how focal companies operating in emerging economies can lead the implementation of sustainability into their supply chains. This research connects and advances the constructs of cleaner production, sustainability and supply chains by exploring a classic case of a focal company operating in an emerging economy that, even facing considerable challenges, has been able to succeed in transforming its entire supply chain. Drawing from stakeholder theory and contingency theory, this research offers four key contributions to the sustainability and supply chain discourses as follows: 1) it proposes an innovation-centered approach to sustainable supply chain management, by adapting and extending the TCOS uncertainty framework; 2) it suggests that the way a focal company manages and is influenced by its established network of relationships shape the evolution of the supply chain sustainability trajectories; 3) it argues that supply chains are dynamic entities and should then be considered and understood through the lenses of evolutionary approaches; and 4) it suggests that the implementation and management of sustainable supply chains are context-specific challenges and therefore theoretical, managerial and policy generalizations are difficult to be achieved. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Churchill Sq. 4, Prague, 3 130 67, Czech Republic","This paper provides a brief introduction and proposal to a new concept that addresses expected future issues in the dynamic digital supply chain organization. Industry 4.0 is a vanguard for massive automation of production. However, researches are focused on questions of internal coordination, collaboration, and optimization. At the same time, the future outlook indicates that additional significant added value is in the application of these externally between partners within a supply chain. The introduced concept is based on the currently finishing research with a goal to introduce a new universal Industry 4.0 maturity model from small- and middle-sized manufacturing companies. This research reused best practices from significant existing Industry 4.0 maturity models but solved identified gaps simultaneously. In addition, additional studies and research were conducted to fill these gaps. On the other hand, the side effect of these steps was a shift in the final focus of the new Industry 4.0 maturity model from a technical to a business perspective. As a result, this new Industry 4.0 maturity model understands Industry 4.0 as a transformation towards a digital learning organization. Regarding this shift and observations on the side of real manufacturing companies, there is a prediction of future issues related to enabling cooperation within a supply chain between partners that is one of the main components of the learning organization paradigm. The introduced concept addresses these future issues with integration and automation between independent organizations and provides possible solutions. This paper also mentions a prototype under development that evaluates the feasibility of this concept. Current tests are performed in laboratory conditions, but there are also described plans for tests under conditions in semi-real situations and planned next stages of the development with the utilization of AI and ML. © 2022 The Authors.

The demand of a product is variable with time and environment. Most of the researchers have considered investment cost, processing cost, and transportation cost as variable costs to minimize the cost while considering a constant demand. In actual practice, the demands are flexible. In this paper, a two-stage stochastic programming model has been proposed for a capacities-based network design of a supply chain for flexible demands while considering inventory carrying cost and missed opportunity cost in addition to the above-mentioned costs. It will enhance the logistic planning and seek the location network optimally. Furthermore, in the first stage, decision variables represent different nodes (facility locations of echelons) of the supply chain, with the assumption that they will be considered at the design stage before uncertain parameters are unveiled. On the other hand, decision variables related to the amount of products to be produced and stored in the nodes of the SC, the flows of materials among the entities of the network, and shortfalls and excess at the customer centers are considered as second-stage variables. The methodology has been illustrated by solving an example. It was found that the proposed model yields more feasible and advantageous results. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84887820972&doi=10.1007%2fs00170-013-5054-2&partnerID=40&md5=b2380227626e023c7178272c5d0dcb44,Scopus

Further, being competitive and challenging environment of the industry, domestic personal care firms are stressed for their supply chain performance. The state of affairs is predominantly critical in the soap manufacturing firms, which have simple, but yet long, supply chain with ample amount of uncertainty due to intense competition, and therefore increase the challenges for firms such as “how much to produce” and “how much should be the production lead time.” Using expert views along with academicians and literature support, this paper investigates the flexibilities associated with soap manufacturing supply chain. The paper utilizes a distinctive approach of assessing the supply chain flexibility through system dynamics (SD) model and endorses the model in a soap manufacturing setting in India. The setting has been examined by changing the level of order rate and production lead time. The model along with the overall supply chain performance of a soap producing unit evaluated indicates the degree of flexibility achievable by the firm. Flexibility dimensions having considerable and outranked influence on enlightening the supply chain performance are recognized. The findings of study indicate demand pattern of packed and unpacked soaps shows seasonal fluctuations; interesting thing is that when one category soap demand increases, the other category’s demand shows slowdown. If case firm takes measures to improve the backlog or production gap through varying lead times, the performance of flexible supply chain can be enhanced. Finding also suggests that improved results may be obtained by varying the order rate. Simulation results show improvement in inventory of packed and unpacked soaps, shipment gap and hiring rate of the firm.

Impacts of COVID-19 are observed ubiquitously in every type of units from different sectors. In this study, a simulation model of the public distribution system (PDS) network is developed with three different scenarios to demonstrate disruptions in the food supply chain. Difficulties have been increased in matching supply and demand in a vast network of PDS because of changing scenarios with the growth of infected cases and recovery.

We focus on cost disturbances and measure their effects in terms of demand variation (QV) in muti-echelon informal supply chain. We show how naïve members contribute to amplification and transmission of QV across the supply chain. Strategic members (characterised by rational profit seeking behaviour) on the contrary, dampens the transmission of QV. Efficient reconfiguration solutions are proposed which minimize the QV for a specific cost disturbance scenario. Rational profit seeking behaviour is one of the criteria for selecting members in this reconfiguration. Rapid reconfiguration in these supply chains is possible due to the existence of informal contracts. A robust deviation reconfiguration solution is also proposed which performs satisfactorily over entire disturbance scenario set. Goodness of this solution is evaluated according to two metrics; namely cost penalty and robust efficiency. Lastly, an illustrative case study on apparel supply chain is presented and it is inferred from the discussion that large aggregators are both cost and robust efficient, hence their presence in supply chain improves performance of robust solution along the two metrics (cost penalty, robust efficiency). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074327819&doi=10.1016%2fj.ejor.2019.09.015&partnerID=40&md5=145cefdfa1920d71047f076fe26b127c,Scopus

The key performance indicators of agricultural supply chain traditionally consider three major dimensions including cost, lead time, and reliability. However, the supply chain flexibility which is an important indicator to assess the ability of all players in the agricultural supply chain can accommodate the additional demand is rarely explored. The objective of this study is to develop a mathematical programming model to assess the supply chain flexibility for cassava business. In this study, a stochastic programming approach is adopted for modeling the flexibility. The proposed model was divided into two stages. The first stage (BASE) evaluates the demand base pattern along the cassava supply chain networks. The second stage (ADD-VOL) is to assess the reserve capacity using the base pattern obtained from the first stage. The reserved capacity at each stage presents the flexibility of the supply chain that can accommodate additional demand. The proposed models could be used to identify the bottlenecks of the supply chain in order to enhance its capacity for better serving the future supply and demand changes. © 2017 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.

The research is based on a simultaneous consideration of both static structural properties of SCD and execution dynamics subject to uncertainty and disruptions. Due to high dimensionality of real SCD problems, such integration can hardly be implemented in only one model. In this study, an original two-model multi-criteria approach is proposed in order to assess the potential ability of an SCD to remain stable and resilient. This modelling approach is based on a combined application of a static and a dynamic model. A multi-criteria approach relies on the analytic hierarchy process method. The results of this research can be used as an additional quantitative analysis tool in order to select an SCD.

System design is becoming more and more complex so there is an increasing interest in highly reliable infrastructure systems, communication systems, transportation and supply chain systems. Dynamic reliability bounds on customer-centered performance measures are presented which are useful for decision making and risk analysis. Performance measures are evaluated based on the expected length of time spent at each state of the system with the intention of capturing the customer's experience with the system. Upper and lower bounds are proposed because they are easier to compute compared with the exact value, which becomes computationally complex as the states of the system and states of the components increase.

The limited resources and time requirements call for coordinated supply chain operations. This paper studies supply chain operations for rescue kits in disaster reliefs, motivated by a real-world application. The objective is to minimise the total tardiness and peak tardiness of product delivery over the multi-period planning horizon. One major challenge is the lack of reliable prediction of customer demand in disasters. In order to cope with demand uncertainty while maintaining the tractability of the optimisation model, we decompose the demand into two components: a relatively stable base demand predicted by historical data and unpredictable demand surges. For the base demand, an optimisation model is developed to optimise the production and distribution operations, as well as the inventory replenishment policy for manufacturers and distribution centres, so as to minimise the total tardiness. For the demand surges, we propose to deploy supply chain flexibility to cope with the uncertainty. An empirical study shows the effectiveness of increasing supply chain flexibility and suggests some managerial insights on configuring such flexibility in emergency operations. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041119757&doi=10.1080%2f00207543.2017.1416203&partnerID=40&md5=9a4a6f221ae2c5866b010404845cb0f4,Scopus

This study considers an uncertain optimization of dynamic supply networks with risk preference and order delivery disruption. Taking the subjective utility of downstream enterprises as a reference point for the utility measurement of order delivery disruption and risk preference, this study constructs a biobjective optimization model with the goal of maximizing the downstream firm's subjective utility and minimizing the manufacturer's cost. The influence of each parameter in the downstream firm's subjective utility function on the integrated optimization was analysed. The research found that the uncertain optimization model with the risk preference of downstream firms for order delivery disruption better controls the actual manufacturer's order allocation and distribution problems when considering the downstream firms' behaviour preference characteristics under bounded rationality. When allocating orders, manufacturers should consider that changes in order delivery disruption will cause changes in the subjective utility of downstream enterprises. In the process of multiperiod cooperation between manufacturers and downstream firms, they can obtain downstream firm risk preferences through repeated investigations. © 2021 Yang Song et al.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118542457&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f1910611&partnerID=40&md5=34ba33d4d6fe3bb39d86d820ccb93eb8,Scopus

Firms that face high environmental uncertainty are increasingly facing higher risks in terms of supply disruptions, production and delivery delays that ultimately result in poor operational performance. This study aims at understanding the antecedents of supply chain operational risk faced by firms and the conditions under which such risks can be mitigated. Using Indian data from the sixth edition of International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS) and structural equation modeling, we investigate the relationships between environmental uncertainty and supply chain risk and the moderating effect of supply chain flexibility. We identify appropriate types of flexibility to mitigate the three major aspects of supply chain risk: supply risk, manufacturing process risk and delivery risk. Our empirical investigation reveals that uncertainty in the supply chain leads to high supply chain risk; and in uncertain environments, supply and manufacturing flexibility help in reducing the supply and manufacturing process risks respectively. However, our results also indicate that, in emerging markets such as India where logistic infrastructure is less developed, internal capabilities alone may not be sufficient in reducing supply chain delivery risk. Our findings not only contribute towards filling certain gaps in the supply chain risk management literature, but also provide practicing managers and researchers a better understanding of the types of flexibility that can mitigate supply chain risk in different business environments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026797628&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2017.07.024&partnerID=40&md5=fba9eb4494ae33b2fb6e19f3168e6b6f,Scopus

Skyline queries are a popular class of MCDS queries that have received a lot of attention recently. However, a vast majority of skyline algorithms focus entirely on the input being a single data set. In this work, we instead focus on supporting the more powerful SkyMapJoin queries. Our Adaptive-SKIN framework conducts processing at two levels of abstraction thereby effectively minimizing the two primary costs, namely the cost of generating join results and the cost of dominance comparisons to compute the final skyline of the join results. Our proposed approach hinges on two key principles. First, in the input space - Adaptive-SKIN determines the abstraction levels dynamically at run time instead of assigning a static one at compile time. This is achieved by adaptively partitioning the input data driven by the feedback of the results already generated. Second, Adaptive-SKIN incrementally build the output space, containing the final skyline, without generating a single join result. Our approach selectively drills into regions in the output space that show promise in generating result tuples as well as avoiding the generation of intermediate results that do not contribute to the query result. In this effort, we propose a cost-vs.-benefit driven strategy for abstraction selection. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the Adaptive-SKIN over state-of-the-art techniques over benchmark data. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866669277&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-33500-6_6&partnerID=40&md5=d04c84c0a9805ced080c6c7f2bff079c,Scopus

Especially container ports experience competition not only for ships but also for supply chains. To adapt to this trend, terminal operators are improving the efficiency in port logistics through, among other things, automation of port operations. Most of these efforts concern processes handling shipped goods. Instead of concentrating on these well-researched improvements, we explored the feasibility and economic potential of an intelligent lighting control system. Often automating handling processes need high investments in hard- and software. This smart lighting system is supposed to control demand-actuated outdoor lights in a harbour environment. In this research, movement profiles of straddle carriers and infrastructural data were gathered and refined to build a model of the observed container terminal. The modelled infrastructure includes the position of every lighting tower and its illuminant as well as their specific power consumption and the respective area, which those lights illume. To control these lights, we developed a control algorithm. We investigated through simulation experiments the power savings for this autonomous lighting control system. Multiple influential factors of this control concept were evaluated by varying the parameterization of the algorithm. A gathered data set, containing trajectories of operating straddle carriers during full terminal utilization, is the basis for the mentioned experiments. The results of varying the utilization rate of the terminal have identified a relationship between capacity and percental power consumption, in the form of a root function. The more straddle carriers run, the less the overall power consumption is increasing. Using the intelligent light control system on full utilization saves 14.67% of the total energy. In the case of 80 % terminal utilization, 18.22 % of total energy is subject for saving effects. Besides these results, we were able to explore the influences of the algorithm parameterization on the energy savings and could assess these solutions economically. © 2020 The Authors.

However, little scholarly attention has been paid to the CSR practices in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)’ supply chains that lie beyond the first-tier supplier. Drawing from the dynamic capabilities perspective, the purpose of this study is twofold: first, to examine how SMEs extend CSR into their multi-tier supply chain (MSC); and second, to investigate the drivers of and the barriers to this process. A multiple-case study was conducted to examine six triadic relationships of SMEs including sub-suppliers. We performed within-case and cross-case analyses. The study shows that SMEs use ‘co-evolving’ or ‘reflexive control’ capabilities to extend CSR to the SME first-tier supplier. The findings reveal that, in contrast, SMEs use ‘active delegation’, ‘supply chain re-conceptualization’ capabilities or a ‘don’t bother’ approach to extend CSR to the SME second-tier supplier. Besides, our study shows that the type of internal drivers (instrumental or normative) determines the dynamic capabilities implemented at the first-tier and at the second-tier supplier level, while external drivers are weak and the barriers are primarily internal. © 2018, 2018 KEDGE Business School.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050534306&doi=10.1080%2f16258312.2018.1497922&partnerID=40&md5=39ea9585b2672fc2ae3c9e625c239532,Scopus

As the semiconductor industry has transitioned from a vertical to horizontal business model, the perceived vulnerability of integrated circuit (IC) design and fabrication has grown dramatically. Design intellectual property (IP) is the defining characteristic of most fabless design houses and integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) within the supply chain, and as such, holds significant value for market competitiveness, and in some cases, national security. Malicious insiders threaten the confidentiality of this proprietary technology. To prevent IP piracy, we redefine the modern threat landscape by considering nearly every individual in the IC design and fabrication process untrusted. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to assure confidential electronic design against insider threats, termed ACED-IT, that enables maintaining the confidentiality of the design when it traverses through different design stages (e.g., RTL/Gate-level to GDSII). ACED-IT integrates encryption, logic locking, novel temporary-inserted logic elements (TILEs), access controls, and action logging, to protect the design IP from insider threats originating from any entity in the process. ACED-IT is compatible with the current industry development flow and provides all engineers with the tools to complete their roles. The proposed ACED-IT framework is demonstrated across various benchmarks and analyzed for security. Benchmarks processed using ACED-IT incurred negligible overhead across parameters such as power, area, timing, and test coverage after functional recovery, and provided a brute force attack complexity to recover the original design exceeding that of AES-256.

This paper presents the results of an exploratory empirical study into service flexibility based on interviews conducted in six companies: a recruitment agency, a plant hire firm, two logistics providers, a procurement service, and a provider of supply chain software. Many of these services provide an important source of flexibility to supply chains. Five roles fulfilled by the services are identified as follows: to provide continuity, to allow for expansion, to provide expertise, to improve cost efficiency, and to reduce risk. In addition, it is found that the companies are able to play these roles through having internal flexibility (e.g., flexible resources and/or excess capacity) and by themselves supplementing this either through their membership of a parent organisation/group (group collaboration) or through external partners (e.g., subcontracting and horizontal collaboration). Future research could build on this contribution, e.g., by conducting an integrated study of a network of manufacturing and service firms, by conducting a quantitative survey to add generality to the findings, and by conducting longitudinal empirical work to observe how supply chains cope with change over time.

The fast source is more expensive than the slow source. Academic/practical relevance: Dual sourcing provides supply chain flexibility to mitigate demand and supply risk. Despite its relevance in practice, characterizing the optimal dual sourcing policy is extremely challenging, and the optimal stochastic policy for nonconsecutive lead times has been unknown for over 50 years. Methodology: We present and solve a robust rolling horizon model for periodically reviewed dual sourcing inventory systems that minimizes the total cost of purchasing, inventory holding, and backlogging. Results: We prove that the optimal robust policy is a dual-index, dual-base-stock policy that constrains or “caps” the slow order and provide closed-form expressions for the three control parameters. The optimality result is established for general lead times and can accommodate nonstationary demand. Our numerical study shows that, as the lead time difference grows, the capped dual index policy increasingly smooths slow orders and for stationary demand, converges to the tailored base-surge policy, which places a constant slow order and has been shown to be asymptotically optimal. Managerial implications: Our capped dual index policy is easy to understand, explain, and implement in practice. In an extensive simulation study, the capped dual index policy performs as well as and can even outperform the best heuristics presented in the stochastic inventory literature. © 2019 INFORMS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076857539&doi=10.1287%2fmsom.2018.0731&partnerID=40&md5=32458ccd30f17d0e362d677aadbf4ce8,Scopus

This research work presents a capacity–inventory management model via system dynamics for a dynamic supply SC, applying model-based optimal control techniques. In the context of high-volume manufacturing (HVM) that present low variability and predictable demand, for mathematical modeling purposes, a set of coupled first-order ordinary differential equations, with an analogy from the mixing problem, is presented, which relates capacity and inventory levels, taking into account a production rate at each node of interaction. The application of ordinary differential equations via the mixing problem (or compartmental analysis) is important based on the idea of a balance between the influx and outflux of raw material along the supply chain. A proper literature review on optimal control for supply chains is analyzed. The mathematical model introduced is presented in a linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space formulation. Stability analysis for the dynamic serial SC is presented, and a sensitivity analysis is also conducted for the capacity and production rate parameters considering the effects of variations in parameters along the SC. An energy-based optimal control is also developed with proper simulations. © 2022 by the authors.

The dynamic alignment preconizes that companies should dynamically manage different types of supply chains (e.g. fully flexible, agile, lean, and continuous replenishment) in order to respond appropriately to various types of customers' behaviours. The sustainable supply chain management approach supports that the design and management of these different types of supply chains should take into account various environmental and social issues as complements to the traditional economic criteria. In a recent study, some authors combine these two trends in a novel conceptual model aiming to help decision-makers to better manage different environmental trade-offs when designing supply chain using the dynamic alignment concept. This paper presents some experimental studies in 'agile' supply chain in order to verify some of the assumptions made by the model.

A supply chain strategy is a key issue for the improvement of the outside. Recent information technologies provide even small- and medium-sized supplier companies with a chance for entering into contracts with major supplier companies and large manufacturing companies in different Keiretsu groups, but will give the trouble for surviving in the dynamic supply chain environment at the same time. This chapter proposes a strategy for MTO (Make To Order) companies to find suitable business partners in the dynamic supply chain environment and to enter into proper contracts with the partners as well as to obtain appropriate profits. A supply chain model proposed in the chapter provides a negotiation protocol to determine suitable prices and delivery times for ordered products through the iteration of the negotiation process between the organizations, as well as through the modification processes of production schedules. A twolayered supply chain model is firstly proposed as a basic model for dynamic supply chain management of MTO companies. The model is extended to a three-layered supply chain model for representing the negotiation protocol among multi-layered organizations.

Mass manufacturing converged to mass customization, the globalized world now allows a wide repertoire of solutions for the production of goods and services. And in this new environment companies are using new technologies and new non-vertical manufacturing structures. Therefore, companies are increasingly relying on resources controlled by other actors. They must be able to combine resources in new ways, either to access those that are additionally required or those own resources to be made available to third parties. One of the challenges of manufacturing in the twenty-first century is the possibility of forming extended companies, able to respond with agility and adaptability, and which can be created on demand from the achievement of technical and strategic alignment of various actors. The extended enterprise, formed by several partners, needs to be dynamically formed, in order to be agile and adaptable. Such companies would be: (i) made possible through sharing and dissemination of information; (ii) able to, quickly and inexpensively, design, optimize and manufacture products; (iii) responsive to all technical and business determinants; and (iv) assessed and certified for guaranteed performance.

Virtually no progress of a similar nature for electro-mechanical systems (orthotics, aircraft, vehicles, surgery, manufacturing cells, etc.) has occurred [1]. A companion paper [2] on the Next Wave of Technology shows that the previous electronics wave was necessary to prepare the foundation to this emerging technology to continuously enhance performance-to-cost ratios for a very wide range of applications that form the core of the discipline of mechanical engineering. Major government agencies (especially in Europe and the U.S.) have begun to structure their programs on ""popular"" ideas reinforced by the news media. Solid science for a multitude of electro-mechanical applications (see the NWT paper) is being displaced in favor of cloud computing, big data, neuro-science, nano-science, etc. The result is now becoming severe. The weakness of any one technology (in this case, the mechanicals) forms a weak link to make the resulting systems of technologies weak. The large failed investment of $30 billion for the Future Combat System (FCS) by the Army is proof of this continuing and growing imbalance. In this paper, we illustrate this large view development objective by concentrating on open architecture vehicles.

The research design was a multiple case study with internal and external validity checks, within-case analysis and cross-case comparisons, based on a research framework that scrutinises the relationships between SC contextual constraints and flexibility types. The study took place in three representative SCs of the Brazilian automotive industry and sought mainly to identify and compare SC contextual constraints that hinder product delivery to end-customers. Constraints such as suppliers' capacity, diversity of suppliers, suppliers' cooperation, trust and commitment, tariffs, exchange rates and inventory were identified in different supplier tiers of the OEMs as the main factors influencing the observed volume and mix flexibilities. Additionally, SCF types such as sourcing, relational, delivery, postponement, new product and responsiveness influenced the SC's flexibility provided to the end-customers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Making reconfiguration decisions requires a system-level optimization that involves many factors such as manufacturing tasks, outsourcing decisions, supply chain configurations, as well as risks. This paper proposes a graph-based cost model to optimize the configuration of manufacturing supply chain networks to support reconfiguration decision-making. An optimization model is formulated to minimize the total cost of the manufacturing enterprise with the consideration of operating cost and reconfiguration cost. To effectively quantify the reconfiguration cost, a graph-based cost model is developed to characterize the relationship between the graphical similarity of two supply chain networks and the reconfiguration cost. Outsourcing decisions and supply chain risks are also considered in the proposed model.

This sector, marked by its two annual collections and its unique items, must become more flexible and provide a faster response to its consumer base. In this context, supply chain management is an important factor in determining the degree of competitiveness of a company. This paper proposes tools to assist in the production scheduling of a luxury industry through making its supply chain more flexible by reducing the number of items delivered before the release, thus allowing the company to react according to the sales. To achieve that, an approach to the calculation of orders based on sales forecasts and on the lead time between stores and distribution centers was devel- oped, in addition to a tool to control the delivery of the items through better integration with the suppliers. The proposed approach reduced the number of items in the first two orders by 17 and 12%, and several delays were avoided through the utilization of the order-control tool. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013128260&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-48511-9_19&partnerID=40&md5=89a63ba9d9227fa9dfa1ed57a8693cb7,Scopus

However SCF is no free lunch and it may require huge investments to realise its potential benefits. 'How much flexibility is required', thus becomes the prime concern for firms willing to be flexible. This question is rarely discussed in the literature and in its scarcity, flexibility performance measurements remains untouched for risky and uncertain environments. Therefore measuring SCF is a prominent field where research needs to be focused. In this paper a mathematical model is proposed to evaluate supply chain flexibility at supplier buyer interface with an aim to attain robust supply in all possible scenarios.

Design/methodology/approach - This research employs two complementary theoretical lenses frequently used in the explanation of relationship performance, resource-based view of the firm and strategic behavior theory. The authors then used an international survey based in three Northern European countries to test their hypotheses with hierarchical linear regression. Findings - The quantitative analysis supports all three hypotheses indicating that supply chain portfolio flexibility is an important determinant for small-to-medium-sized firm satisfaction with supply chain portfolio performance. Additionally, firm alliance orientation and entrepreneurial orientation both significantly influence the relationship between supply chain flexibility and performance satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - This research is limited by the categorization of the supply chain portfolio flexibility types as high and low resource linkages by the researchers. Future research may look at additional ways to measure individual agreements and have firms categorize them according to resource requirements. However, the findings of this research provide a theoretical and empirical foundation through the application of resource-based view of the firm and strategic behavior theory for future research in the area of small-to-medium-sized firms and their satisfaction with supply chain portfolios. Practical implications - Important managerial implications are found for small to medium-sized firms and larger firms that work with them when managing portfolio satisfaction. This research indicates that it makes sense for managers to consider categorizing supply chain relationships similar to the way they categorize their end-user relationships. This allows small-to-medium-sized firms across the portfolio to be segmented into groups where appropriate relationship maintenance can take place and where more suitable satisfaction goals can be defined in terms of operational metrics. Originality/value - The framework developed in this paper provides insights on small-to-medium-sized firm satisfaction with supply chain portfolio performance.

This is especially salient with the fast growing availability of various technologies to monitor in real-time through recent advances such as the Internet of Things (IoT) with specific emphasis on Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) and associated sensor networks. This study is motivated by the lack of published literature in data acquisition and analytics that specifically addresses sufficient real-time data acquisition for effective managerial monitoring. As a step in addressing this void, we review and extend existing literature in this general area by studying various requirements and information sources that relate to effective management monitoring. We then design an exploratory study to evaluate current managerial monitoring needs and the importance of automated data collection technologies. Results from this study show that the most important latent factor that influences an organization's information need is its dynamic competitiveness, and consequently, companies with a dynamic supply chain would need a faster transaction and operations data system.

Transparency in the food supply chain is essential to guarantee food quality and provenance to all users of food and food products. Intensified information exchange and integrated information systems involving all chain actors are needed to achieve transparency with respect to a multitude of food properties. In this paper, specific challenges of food supply chains are highlighted. Major elements are addressed that support transparency to consumers, the government and food companies, which are considered the claimants of transparency. Elements considered to be enablers of transparency are governance mechanisms, quality and safety standards and information exchange. The paper specifies these transparency claimants and enablers for food supply chains and identifies major information system functions and information technology applications needed to comply with transparency demands. It thereby provides a framework for transparency analysis in food supply chains. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

South Africa (SA) could competitively export near-zero embodied GHG primary iron to steelmakers in leading decarbonizing markets. A green primary iron production process substitutes hydrogen for coke as the iron ore reductant. A SA plant would enjoy most of its competitive cost advantage from hydrogen produced using very low-cost solar photovoltaic electricity. In import markets, using the European Union (EU) as an example, steelmakers could use imported green primary iron to increase utilization of electric arc furnaces while reducing total EU demand for clean electricity (i.e. for hydrogen for reduction needs) and thereby lower total system costs of decarbonization. SA could bolster crucial export and tax revenues while moving towards a broader transition to a sustainable industry. Three things are needed to unlock new global business models involving the relocating of green primary iron production to regions with abundant renewable energy: (1) a steelmaker with access to a hydrogen reduction technology appropriate for SA’s ores willing and able to invest in a plant; (2) access to a bankable lead market for that plant’s production; and (3) international trade rules and emissions accounting related to the carbon content of commodities that enable the reconfiguration of supply chains to reduce global decarbonization costs. Key policy insights Green primary iron production in SA could increase value added from local iron ore and solar energy resources, bolster exports and initiate transformation to a sustainable industry. Green primary iron imports from SA to the EU could reduce the cost of overall decarbonization while increasing the competitiveness of steel product manufacturing. Enabling conditions include a willing steelmaker, fair access to the EU iron market, enabling trade rules, and embodied emissions certification and accounting. Green primary iron imports can reduce demands on EU low carbon electricity supply, lowering electricity prices and increasing energy security. The collaboration envisioned between the EU and SA could help develop the framework for future inter-regional decarbonization strategies for other commodities and other countries. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122851259&doi=10.1080%2f14693062.2021.2024123&partnerID=40&md5=947177f6d2dbe502223d95da38de5aed,Scopus

The results show that external information integration positively influences both reactive and proactive flexibility. Furthermore, proactive flexibility significantly affects financial performance and operational performance. Moreover, both reactive and proactive flexibility have positive mediating effects on the connection between external information integration and operational performance. Lastly, reactive flexibility positively mediates external information integration’s effect on financial performance.

However, there is environment cost for producing PV systems, including all carbon emissions generated from all phases of manufacturing supply chain. Thus, energy payback time (EPBT) has become important criteria to evaluate the performance PV systems. Estimating EPBT of PV systems relies on life cycle analysis (LCA) assessment. Current carbon footprint (CF) calculation uses long-run CF averaging method, which generates static CF information. However, solar PV Supply chain is quite dynamic because PV system components may be manufactured in different regions and use different power sources. Thus, the averaging method is not able to capture the dynamics of CF and that also implies that the uncertainties and data quality of CF auditing are negatively impacted. This study proposes an IoT-based dynamic carbon footprint approach to address the challenges above. The proposed method aims to capture LCA measuring data from IoT sensors and calculate dynamic CF of PV module across PV supply chain. The dynamic CF allows each PV module to have unique CF pedigree information based on its source of parts, the mix of energy types used during the manufacturing stage, and other CF related allocation data. The dynamic CF information can greatly reduce the information asymmetry between data providers and CF auditors, thus lowering the uncertainties and improving the data quality of CF auditing.

The authors use the lens of ambidexterity (the ability both to exploit and explore) to analyse responses to complexity, since this enables the authors to understand the application of known solutions in conjunction with innovative ones to resolve difficulties. This research also seeks to investigate how managers respond to supply chain complexities that can either be operationally deleterious or strategically beneficial. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a descriptive framework based on the project management (PM) literature to understand response options to complexity, and then use interviews with supply chain managers in six organisations to examine the utility of this framework in practice. The authors ask the research question “How do managers in supply chains respond to complexities”? Findings: The case study data show first that managers faced with structural, socio-political, or emergent supply chain complexities use a wide range of responses. Second, over a third of the instances of complexity coded were actually accommodated, rather than reduced, by the study firms, suggesting that adapting to supply chain complexity in certain instances may be strategically appropriate. Third, the lens of ambidexterity allows a more explicit assessment of whether existing PM solutions can be considered or if novel methods are required to address supply chain complexities. Practical implications: The descriptive framework can aid managers in conceptualising and addressing supply chain complexity. Through exploiting current knowledge, managers can lessen the impact of complexity while exploring other innovative approaches to solve new problems and challenges that evolve from complexity growth driven by business strategy. Originality/value: This study addresses a gap in the literature through the development of a framework which provides a structure on ways to address supply chain complexity. The authors evaluate an existing project complexity concept and demonstrate that it is both applicable and valuable in non-project, ongoing operations. The authors then extend it using the lens of ambidexterity, and develop a framework that can support practitioners in analysing and addressing both strategically necessary supply complexities, together with unwanted, negative complexities within the organisation and across the supply chain. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046539071&doi=10.1108%2fIJOPM-01-2017-0062&partnerID=40&md5=f356578e8cb76c47b34e760c790d3c69,Scopus

Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur, India; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, India","Purpose: The importance of supply network flexibility (SNF) in the development of mass customization capability (MCC) has been implied in the literature but seldom subjected to empirical investigation. To fill the gap and contribute to MC literature, this paper aims to examine the role of SNF in facilitating the development of MCC of organizations. Furthermore, it has been investigated whether the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) strengthens the above relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the supply chain literature and dynamic capability theory, the study proposes a research framework depicting the interconnectedness among the variables of interest. The proposed framework has been tested using structural equation modelling based on partial least squares by using the data collected from a questionnaire-based survey of a sample of Indian manufacturing organizations. Findings: The findings indicate that the dimensions of SNF, namely, sourcing flexibility and supplier flexibility, positively affect the MCC of the organizations and the strength of these relationships is further amplified by the implementation of ICTs. Practical implications: The study shows the managerial opportunities for the development of a flexible and competent supply network to facilitate the development or enhancement of MCC. Originality/value: This study contributes to scant literature by providing empirical evidence for the relationship between SNF and MCC. Further, this study enriches the understanding of the crucial role of ICT by exploring its moderating effect on the relationship between the variables of interest. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121387293&doi=10.1108%2fJBIM-11-2020-0503&partnerID=40&md5=3a79674af646b6ee6124a713e6b79ddd,Scopus

Applying the dynamic capabilities view of how businesses cope with changing environments, we develop a conceptual model that links product variety management strategies with supply chain responsiveness, and relates supply chain responsiveness to cost and customer service in high- and low-customization environments. We find that a product variety management strategy influences both supply chain cost and customer service performance only when mediated by internal and external responsiveness capabilities. In addition, a product variety management strategy has different impacts on performance depending on the level of product customization. Specifically, in a low-customization environment, both supply chain flexibility and agility acting as dynamic capabilities have a significant influence on cost efficiency while in a high-customization environment, these dynamic capabilities have a significant influence on customer service. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013790497&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijpe.2017.02.005&partnerID=40&md5=5bd28cd79a87d9678dafefafa2ef7e00,Scopus

To help mitigate the impact on SC of increased product variety, the purpose of this paper is to examine how variety management activities including variety management strategy (VMS), supplier partnerships and close customer relationships affect SC flexibility and agility at different levels of customisation. Design/methodology/approach - A survey-research methodology is employed using data from 363 manufacturing firms from the UK and South Korea. In particular, cluster analysis and structural equation modelling were used to evaluate the proposed model according to the level of customisation. Findings - The results suggest that internal variety management strategy and external SC integration have a positive influence on SC flexibility and agility. Customer relationships and variety management strategies influence SC flexibility more than partnerships with suppliers whereas variety management strategies and partnerships with suppliers influence SC agility more than customer relationships. In fact, for external integration in particular, customer relationships influence SC flexibility (i.e. reaction capability) rather than agility (i.e. reaction time) whereas partnerships with suppliers influence SC agility rather than flexibility. In a high-customisation context, close customer relationships are the most effective way to increase SC flexibility, whereas partnerships with suppliers are the most effective way to increase SC agility. In a low-customisation context, a VMS and customer relationships are the most effective way to increase both SC flexibility and agility.

However, its application in the extractive industries remains unclear. Minerals and metals move through a complex and dynamic global supply chain, which makes it difficult to 'assign' socio-economic impacts to any one location. Intermediate products (e.g. metals) generally comprise many different inputs - some of which may be used in very small quantities but, nevertheless, impart essential and/or valuable properties to the final product - making it challenging to assign values. The SEA process is made even more complex by the diverse range of downstream applications which these products have, the potential for future innovation and a lack of reliable socio-economic statistics for the sector. In 2013/14, Risk & Policy Analysts Ltd undertook the first global study on the socio-economic value for manganese (Mn).

This new perspective in supply chain design requires an understanding of the relationships among costs, supply chain risk drivers, and investments in supply chain capabilities. In this paper, we develop a multi-objective stochastic model for supply chain design under uncertainty and time-dependency. Sources of risk are modeled as a set of scenarios, and the risk of the system is determined. The objective is to examine the trade-offs among investments in improving supply chain capabilities and reducing supply chain risks, and to minimize cost of supply chain disruptions. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, a heuristic algorithm based on a relaxation method is designed to determine an optimal or near-optimal solution. To examine the efficiency of the heuristic algorithm, a numerical example is provided.

In This paper, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is developed for responsive, resilient and sustainable mixed open and closed-loop supply chain network design (SCND) problem. The uncertainty of the problem is handled with a hybrid robust-stochastic optimization approach. A Lagrangian relaxation (LR) method and a constructive heuristic (CH) algorithm are developed for overcoming problem complexity and solving large-scale instances. In order to assess the performance of the mathematical model and solution methods, some test instances are generated. The computations showed that the model and the solution methods are efficient and can obtain high-quality solutions in suitable CPU times. Other analyses and computations are done based on a real case study in the tire industry. The results demonstrate that resilient strategies are so effective and can improve economic, environmental and social dimensions substantially. Research findings suggest that the proposed model can be used as an efficient tool for designing sustainable and resilient SCs and the related decision-makings. Also, our findings prove that resilience is necessary for continued SC sustainability. It is concluded that using proposed resilience strategies simultaneously brings the best outcome for SC objectives.

The main data source consists of field notes collected by one author, who held a temporary position within the organization. Additional data were collected from observations, internal documents, informal talks and 20 interviews. Findings: The authors found controlling and enabling organizational practices in four main categories on two levels as follows: managing network composition (system level), managing order fulfillment and returns (operations level), category management (both levels) and capability enhancement (both levels).

Considering the mixed results obtained from linking supplier integration with performance outcomes, a 'dynamic' component - or the ability to reconfigure the supply chain to adapt to changing environments - appears critical to creating a sustainable competitive advantage. This study identifies integration sensing, seizing and transforming as sub-capabilities that together form a dynamic capability, referred to herein as supplier integrative capability (SIC). That is, SIC enables buyers to sense changes in the supply environment by sharing information with suppliers, seize opportunities presented by establishing procedures to analyse this information and make long-term changes to existing processes. A global sample from the industrial sector reveals that the three capabilities exhibit complementarity and must exist simultaneously for the capability to be effective, which then enhances both process flexibility and cost efficiency and helps firms avoid the traditional trade-off of cost and flexibility. In addition, market and technological dynamics strengthen the effect of SIC on operational performance; supply base complexity attenuates this link. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Compared to previous models proposed in the literature, our research incorporates a richer cost structure involving joint replenishment costs for raw material replenishment and production, and a more realistic description of the transportation costs represented as a vector of full-truck load costs for different size trucks. This problem can be displayed graphically as a time-expanded transshipment network defined by nodes and arcs that can be reached by feasible material flows. First, we propose an integrated mixed integer linear programming model that minimizes the cost over the entire supply chain for a given planning horizon. The model determines the optimal dynamic supplier selection, inventory lot-sizing, and production schedule simultaneously. Second, a sequential approach is proposed to solve the same problem. That is, a production schedule is determined first, and then a supplier selection and replenishment strategy is obtained according to that predetermined schedule. Sensitivity analysis comparing the two approaches is performed. Results show that, even though the integrated approach achieves the minimum cost, the sequential approach may be suitable for solving large-scale instances of the problem as it requires less information sharing and generates a near-optimal solution with shorter implementation time and computational effort. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123955533&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-021-04508-z&partnerID=40&md5=8d1fd3f845a16f6440409e6ccf7b1a92,Scopus

This “pivot to the South” by Russia and other Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries is of particular significance in light of the required reconfiguration of supply chains in Eurasia. Russian exporters, importers and freight forwarding companies’ needs in alternative logistical opportunities have increased dramatically. The INSTC development would promote Eurasian intra- and transcontinental connectivity, reduce export costs, develop new production niches, and realize the Caspian region’s transit potential.

Consequently, a genetic algorithm based approach is utilised as the solution methodology.

The purpose of this paper is to compare how two open European economies position themselves competitively within MedTech GVCs: highly developed Switzerland and the emerging Czech Republic. Design/methodology/approach: The research applies a mixed methodology to analyze the performance of each location in the MedTech GVCs. It draws on macroeconomic, industry, trade and a proprietary sample of firm data, combined with onsite interviews. Findings: The economic outcomes and GVC positions differ in both cases, whereas Switzerland focuses on high value-added activities such as R&D and after-sales service. Specialized manufacturing is also located here in spite of high costs. By contrast, the Czech Republic focuses mostly on low value-added activities, like manufacturing disposables, although some domestic innovative companies are notable. The authors generalize four types of firms in the industry, comparing their presence in both locations. Practical implications: The competitive positions and challenges faced by each location when engaging in MedTech GVCs are summarized and related to economic outcomes. In the Czech Republic, the barriers to upgrading include its business environment, and weak links between education institutions and industry. Switzerland’s high cost structure is offset by adding high value in core competencies. Both countries should protect the inherent advantage their locations offer within responsive European supply chains. Originality/value: GVC research in the MedTech sector has been limited.

Those systems not only need to be operated as separate systems (e.g., optimizing each transport modality in supply networks), but also are required to capture complex situations as interconnected entity (e.g., adapting a transport chain involving different modalities according to weather conditions). SoS can handle such challenges through emerging behavior, while letting each of the involved systems operate separately. The latter property requires interoperability of systems that can be preserved even in dynamically changing environments applying the theory of bigraphs. Abstract relationships allow not only the representation of dynamic interaction but also the respecification of these systems through behavior adaptations. This abstraction supports cross-system decomposition as well as composition of interaction patterns for the purpose of emergent behavior. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by orchestrating two distributed and independent systems.

The quest for reducing capital expenditures (CAPEX) in EPC projects is intensifying.

The project aimed to propose innovative ways of improving the EPC business model to reach the next level (“EPC 4.0”). In doing so, lessons learned from the automotive and aviation industry were considered. A key objective of the research project was to challenge statements of international EPC experts to cut CAPEX by 40–50% in EPC projects. With this statement in mind, the research focused on identifying measures with potential in six areas: (1) digitalization, (2) partnering, (3) flat supply chains, (4) flexible organizations, (5) core competences, and (6) the human factor.

Prerequisite for a successful implementation is the functional capability of end-use applications for which different volumetric hydrogen thresholds are documented in literature. A clear research gap is thereby evident for HNG fired medium-speed large-bore gas engines typical used for stationary power generation. For solving this problem, generic single cylinder tests with focus on operating window, NOx formation and hydro-carbon emissions have been carried out. The results are analysed and compared to available publications of HNG fired high-speed gas engines to derive general insights of the combustion characteristics. Under rising blending share, an in literature described, general shifting of the possible operating window and an increase of NOx formation are detected. In terms of unburned hydrocarbons, a NOx-neutral reduction potential through hydrogen blending is only visible under very lean operating conditions.

Prior studies have reported on the influence of big data analytics–enabled dynamic capability (BDA) for improved organizational agility and organizational performance, but there has been a paucity of literature regarding the role of big data analytics–enabled dynamic capability in untangling the supply chain ambidexterity dilemma and organizational performance. To address these research gaps, this paper draws on the dynamic capability view of the organization under the contingent effect of environmental dynamism. We tested our research hypotheses using 281 surveys, gathered using a pre-tested questionnaire. Our results suggest that BDA has positive effects on improving supply chain agility (SCAG), supply chain adaptability (SCAD) and performance measures (cost performance and operational performance). However, we noted that hypotheses regarding the moderating effect of environmental dynamism (ED) on the paths joining BDA and SCAG/SCAD were not supported. To address these unexpected results, we conducted post hoc analysis to explain the rationale behind the insignificant moderating effects of ED on the paths joining BDA and SCAG/SCAD. We found that the effects of BDA on SCAG/SCAD were higher under intermediate levels of environmental dynamism but comparatively weak when the environmental dynamism is low or high. Hence, we can argue that big data analytics can help enhance supply chain agility, supply chain adaptability, and organizational performance, but these effects are contingent upon the level of environmental dynamism. Moreover, a non-linear, inverse U-shaped moderating effect of environmental dynamism exists. Collectively, these findings provide a theory-based understanding of the organizational level of usage of big data analytics and its effects on supply chain agility, supply chain adaptability, and organizational performance. Moreover, they further shape our understanding of how big data analytics–enabled dynamic capabilities yield differential results under the moderating effect of environmental dynamism.

Considering market randomness and accumulation of production experience, a Stackelberg differential game model is constructed. In the game, the manufacturer is the leader and its pricing and emission reduction strategies over time are deduced in farsighted and myopic behaviors, respectively. In both behaviors, the emission reduction increases over time and a relatively low/high carbon price leads to skimming/penetrating pricing strategy of the manufacturer. Numerical study shows that the manufacturer must adopt a farsighted behavior for profit seeking except that consumers' low-carbon awareness is quite low, and the retailer also prefers the manufacturer to adopt this behavior. Increasing carbon price and consumers' low-carbon awareness benefits the manufacturer rather than the retailer. The governments can take measures to raise the carbon price to reduce the environmental impact. © 2022 Shihao Wan et al.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125371186&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f5857852&partnerID=40&md5=33a5fe72464830a254126ef85774e420,Scopus

The numerical analysis illustrates that the emission reduction level, green reputation, demand, and entire profit of the supply chain are larger in the integrated setting than the counterparts in the decentralized setting.

Finally, CPFR has a significant influence on both supplier and customer engagement, with supply chain intelligence influencing customer engagement in the SCC.

Such a situation promotes supply chain firms and governments to take various measures to achieve the sustainable goal. This paper investigates the cost-sharing cooperation strategy of emission reductions in a dynamic supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and two distinct retailers with different scales. In the presence of carbon tax and green reputation, we model a Stackelberg differential game to derive and compare the optimal equilibrium decisions and further conduct a numerical study to analyze the chain members’ profits between the cases of no cost sharing and cost sharing. The manufacturer can actualize this sharing, respectively, with either of the competitive retailers. The results show that cost sharing is a better choice for supply chain members than no sharing. In the cost-sharing scenario, the manufacturer and two retailers prefer the case in which the emission reduction cost that a retailer undertakes is relatively high, because the manufacturer can increase emission reduction level to build its green reputation, and thereby the retailers can improve profits. When the proportion of emission reduction cost that a retailer undertakes locates in a certain interval, all the supply chain participants can be better off in the scenario where small-scale retailer shares the emission reduction cost. In addition, the increase in carbon tax improves the flexibility of cost-sharing ratio for the members achieving this consensual scenario on the cost-sharing cooperation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123494723&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-021-02031-6&partnerID=40&md5=c3def6d9d1634e1985dd3fa4269bd3a9,Scopus

This paper considers a dynamic supply chain, which is composed of a manufacturer and a retailer, in the presence of the cap-and-trade regulation and the consumers' reference emission effects. To investigate the manufacturer's behavior choice and its impacts on the emission reduction and pricing strategies together with the profits of both the channel members, we develop a Stackelberg differential game model in which the manufacturer acts in both myopic and farsighted manners. By comparing the equilibrium strategies, it can be found that the farsighted manufacturer always prefers to keep a lower level of emission reduction. When the emission permit price is relatively high, the wholesale/retail price is lower if the manufacturer is myopic and hence benefits consumers. In addition, there exists a dilemma that the manufacturer is willing to act in a farsighted manner but the retailer looks forward to a partnership with the myopic manufacturer. For a relatively high price of emission permit, adopting myopic strategies results in a better performance of the whole supply chain. © 2019 Jun Wang et al.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062635902&doi=10.1155%2f2019%2f3123572&partnerID=40&md5=73459490824e44a75bce4c5af0c129d8,Scopus

It is, however, inadequate to meet the low-carbon targets by the manufacturing industry alone. Current research on emission reduction targets mainly at individual optimality, with little consideration of the synergistic benefits achievable through coordination among supply chain players. This paper fills this gap by incorporating Pareto improvement to ensure that all members are likely to gain in emission reduction through coordination. It gives the emission-dependent manufacturers theoretical basis and managerial insights to go through the stringent emission-limited market, especially under a new proposed low-carbon policy of flexible cap-and-trade, which will soon be deployed for emissions trading in China. This flexible cap-and-trade policy aligns emission reduction with capacity adjustments, but its impact has rarely been investigated. Considering the complexity of the supply chain structure, this paper simplifies the problem to two stages: manufacturer and retailer. While the demand uncertainty is considered with Newsvendor models, Stackelberg game is exploited to solve this problem with three contracts, namely revenue sharing, cost sharing, and two-part tariff. Analytical and numerical studies show that the profitability and greenness of the supply chain are increased by coordination with revenue sharing and two-part tariff contracts. The Pareto improvement encourages cooperation between the supply chain members. Managerial insights are given to help emission-dependent manufacturers compete in the increasingly stringent low-carbon environment.

This paper constructs a supply chain model in three modes: (i) no carbon emission quota policy, (ii) the government implements the first stage of a carbon quota policy, and (iii) the government offers lower carbon quotas in the second stage. The analysis reveals that when the initial carbon quota allocated by the government meets certain conditions, the emission reduction rate in the first stage of the carbon quota policy is greater than that without the carbon quota policy; and an interesting finding is that the reduction rate further increases when the government reduces carbon quotas in the second stage. In addition to the reduction rate, the manufacturer's and the retailer's profits increase with consumers' preference for low-carbon products. With an increase of the decline parameter of free allocated carbon emission rights, the profits of both the manufacturer and the retailer decrease, but the profit of the manufacturer in the second stage is always lower than that in the first stage, whereas the retailer's profit is higher in the second stage than in the first stage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071887678&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2019.118244&partnerID=40&md5=09e28f873aa771d76455ab09df5d1adf,Scopus

Companies in China rely much on relational ties to implement business strategies. Combining social network theory with dynamic capability perspective, we build a model that analyzes the direct and indirect impact of relational ties (business ties and service ties) on innovation performance through supply chain adaptability. We further analyze that technological turbulence and dysfunctional competition influence the relationships between relational ties and supply chain adaptability. We test these relationships using data collected from 300 manufacturers in China. The results show that service ties plays a relatively more important role than business ties in enhancing innovation performance directly. Interactions between business ties and service ties significantly influence innovation performance. Moreover, our results demonstrate that supply chain adaptability fully mediates the relationship between business ties and innovation performance but partially mediates the relationship between service ties and innovation performance. Our results show that technological turbulence positively moderates the relationships between business/service ties and supply chain adaptability. In addition, dysfunctional competition negatively moderates the relationship between business ties and supply chain adaptability.

In this paper, a novel attempt is conceptualized to model a flexible supplier selection (FSS) problem by integrating the qualitative and quantitative models for supplier selection problem. A MINLP, a quantitative model, is considered in the proposed FSS framework where factors such as lead time, quality, supplier's capacity and transportation cost are considered. Similarly, in qualitative model factors such as loyalty, technology adaptability, CSR and environmental factors are considered. AHP and IRP, qualitative models, have been applied and compared for supplier's ranking. An integrated ranking of AHP and IRP is used for modeling FSS problem. Finally, Integration of quantitative and qualitative model provides the set of deviation which measure the level of flexibility from pure solution of supplier selection problem by quantitative and qualitative model.

Being able to deliver customized product with low costs and fast delivery times, the concept of mass customization, is a prerequisite for maintained competitiveness with the demands from the market today. This paper presents a product configuration system (PCS) for customized products using design automation enabled by knowledge-based engineering (KBE) and enterprise-wide optimization (EWO). With this approach, the process from sales to delivery of customized products can be extensively rationalized. The PCS consists of two modules. The first being a configurator for use in the sales quotation stage. Here, customer requirements are captured, and used to generate alternatives feasible for the customer context. Thereby, correct quotations can be generated at the sales instance. The second module is the enterprise-wide configurator where accepted orders are concurrently optimized for their detailed and final design, considering the current state of the production and concurrent sales cases in the company. In other terms, instead of adapting the supply chain according to the design of the products in the order entry, the design of the products in the order entry are adapted according to the state of the supply chain. Thereby, resources can be efficiently utilized to the benefit of both the customer and the company, with reduced costs and delivery times. An implementation of the PCS in a case concerning spiral staircases, an ETO product, has shown potential of substantially reducing resources and errors and enable a reliable process supporting achievement of mass customization. © 2021 by ASME",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119974304&doi=10.1115%2fDETC2021-68426&partnerID=40&md5=5f8a22f52eb1846af943366fa7c6466f,Scopus

Firstly, a contraction condition that ensures convergence to any feasible state trajectories or setpoints is constructed. This condition is then imposed as a constraint on the optimization problem for model predictive control with a general (typically economic) cost function, utilizing Riemannian weighted graphs and shortest path techniques.

Research objectives of this paper are a traditional formulation and a network-based model of the DSCR problem; tests to promote intuitive interpretation of our models; tests to identify computational characteristics of each model to determine if one offers superior solvability; and tests to identify sensitivity of run time relative to primary parameters. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878154630&doi=10.1016%2fj.cor.2013.04.011&partnerID=40&md5=17a6bf5b341c143c0dff4c621ef927f5,Scopus

However, limited research has focused on analyzing and empirically testing the dynamics of achieving enhanced flexibility performance. Drawing upon the knowledge-based view of the firm, the purpose of this paper is to address this research gap by introducing supply chain learning (SCL) and integration as key factors in the process. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data were collected in India. Structural equation modeling technique was used as the main analysis method to test the proposed conceptual model on SCL, integration, and flexibility performance. Findings - Research findings indicate that the supply chain integration construct (in its internal and external dimensions) mediates the proposed SCL-flexibility performance relationship. The analysis also confirms the positive relationship between cross-functional integration and inter-firm integration. Research limitations/implications - Focusing on only one country may limit the generalizability of the findings. Also, cross-sectional data collection may not be the ideal approach for evaluating the impacts of SCL. Therefore, future research with longitudinal data and in different contexts is warranted to validate the research results of this study. Originality/value - The proposed conceptual model adds to the limited existing knowledge body of SCL and links SCL, integration, and flexibility performance.

In this study, we tried to apply it to SMEs in developing countries, such as Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to show whether it is true that the supply chain cannot be applied to SMEs, while for a disruption as it is today, competition is getting tougher not only among SMEs but also against large companies, and SMEs need to develop several strategies that were previously unimaginable. This study uses quantitative techniques to determine the effect of supply chain agility, supply chain adaptability, supply chain alignment on supply chain performance either partially or simultaneously.

Relational embeddedness is often considered as crucial driver for the improvement of supply chain flexibility. However, quantitative studies demonstrating these links are scant and an increasing amount of evidence suggests that there is a need to develop a complete model of relational embeddedness on supply chain flexibility by examining the potential mediating effect of absorptive capacity. To meet this need, we define relational embeddedness and absorptive capacity, develop a valid and reliable instrument to measure these, build a framework that relates relational embeddedness, absorptive capacity and supply chain flexibility, and then test structural relationships within this framework using SPSS.

Disruption can have expensive and extensive results for the entire agile supply chain. To mitigate the risk of disruption and improve the reliability of the whole agile supply chain, decision-makers need to pay more attention to supply chain design and construction while simultaneously taking into account the sourcing strategy decisions. This paper proposes a series of models for the design of agile supply chains using dynamic programming modeling. These provide decision-makers with a systematic way of analyzing one of the key decisions of sourcing strategy, namely the trade-off between the number of supply partners and reliability. The efficacy of the models is demonstrated through their application to a Chinese bus and coach manufacturer by way of an empirical illustration. The results show that this approach is effective for this application, and it can be applied in other related decision-making scenarios.

In response to that, new logistics concepts such as on-demand logistics and shared warehousing popped up recently, which with the help of the e-marketplaces offer innovative logistics solutions through a single access point and support the logistics actors to: easily optimize the capacity of their warehouse, avoid the fixed costs of owning a warehouse; implement short-term supply chain planning and finally come closer to the end-customer. Although several on-demand warehousing practices can be seen worldwide, the Greek economic crisis delayed until recently the emergence of such trends so, little is known on how the Greek market would respond to such changes. In response to that, this paper introduces briefly the first on-demand warehousing platform to be operating in Greece and closes the knowledge gap on the Greek market’s response following a three-step methodological process: conducting a dedicated questionnaire survey circulated to different types of businesses, arranging logistics expert groups and carrying out extensive desktop research. The paper shows that the Greek stakeholders are quite familiar to shared warehousing solutions and they are open to digital changes such as using an on-demand warehousing platform. However, they are less willing to apply such innovations to their daily business. Therefore, specific platform requirements for increasing the attractiveness of such tools to the Greek market are also highlighted. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096412338&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-61075-3_81&partnerID=40&md5=fe6362ef7f26044ef6526e65c4bdf7c8,Scopus

We then examine whether revenue-sharing, buyback, and all-unit quantity discount contracts can coordinate our supply chain. We show that the all-unit quantity discount contract fails to coordinate. However, the revenue-sharing and buyback contracts can coordinate the supply chain, but only when the supply chain has a sufficient total working capital. Moreover, they cannot allocate profit flexibly unless the supplier has a large enough working capital.

Such dynamism leads to new challenges in security and dependability. Collaborating services in a system with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) may belong to different security realms but often need to be engaged dynamically at runtime. If their security realms do not have a direct cross-realm authentication relationship, it is technically difficult to enable any secure collaboration between the services. A potential solution to this would be to locate intermediate realms at runtime, which serve as an authentication path between the two separate realms. However, the process of generating an authentication path for two distributed services can be highly complicated. It could involve a large number of extra operations for credential conversion and require a long chain of invocations to intermediate services. In this paper, we address this problem by designing and implementing a new cross-realm authentication protocol for dynamic service interactions, based on the notion of service-oriented multiparty business sessions. Our protocol requires neither credential conversion nor establishment of any authentication path between the participating services in a business session. The correctness of the protocol is formally analyzed and proven, and an empirical study is performed using two production-quality Grid systems, Globus 4 and CROWN.

Based on the combination of fuzzy Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and Analytic Network Process (fuzzy-DEMATEL-ANP), the interrelationships between the indicators and the weights of each indicator are calculated. The research results indicate that decision-makers in the humanitarian supply chain should vigorously coordinate the cooperation among stakeholders, ensure the effective transmission of information, and formulate forward-looking strategic plans.

And in order to reduce the adverse impact of disasters and to improve the disaster relief practices, academicians and practitioners are emphasizing on a number of diverse factors of humanitarian supply chain by segmenting them into different clusters. This research is intended to address the critical success factors (CSFs) of humanitarian supply chain which emerges during disaster preparedness and immediate response phase. Through a review of literature and expert consultation, 12 critical success factors leading to responsive humanitarian supply chains have been identified. In this paper, the authors have used Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) approach to interpret the interdependency among the selected CSFs. In addition, MICMAC (Matrice d'Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement (cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification)) analysis is also used to illustrate the relative driving and dependence power among the selected factors. This paper argues that, Government policies and Organizational structure is the most dominating factor which has the highest driving power and the minimum dependence power as it drive others factors and forms the base of interpretive structure model.

The results show that the characteristics of network relationships positively affect the innovation performance of SMEs. Supply chain dynamic capability plays an intermediary role between network relationships and SMEs’ innovation relationships. Different geographical proximity levels of the supply chain lead to different coordination interaction and knowledge sharing efficiency between upstream and downstream, which not only positively moderates the relationship between supply chain dynamic capability and SMEs’ innovation performance, but also moderates its mediating effect. Furthermore, the fs QCA analysis results show three configurations for SMEs’ high innovation performance based on the characteristics of network relations: geographic proximity regulating type, network relationship dominant type, and dynamic coordination and integration type. © 2021 by the authors.

A newsvendor-like retailer is capital constrained and orders products using a supplier's trade credits to satisfy uncertain market demand. Most existing studies show that the retailer always postpones payment until the due date. To recall the loans earlier, we present a case in which the supplier, as a Stackelberg leader, offers an incentive of a discounted wholesale price in the second order to entice the retailer to choose flexible early payment. The proposed incentive is related to the retailer's early payment time in the first period. In the presence of bankruptcy risks for both the retailer and supplier, we propose a continuous newsvendor model of a two-period supply chain to analyze the decisions involved in the flexible trade credit contract. The analytic forms confirm that such an incentive can improve the decentralized supply chain efficiency and decreases the supplier's trade credit risk. The retailer always prefers early payment to payment around the due date to increase revenues. Furthermore, the action of paying early might help the retailer adjust cash flow between the two periods. We also find that a revenue sharing contract significantly affects the retailer's payment behavior and supplier's wholesale price.

These supply chains, which are called ""supply mesh,"" generally refer to heterogeneous electronic marketplaces in which dynamic supply chains, as per project (often make-to-order), are formed across different parties. Conceptually, in a supply mesh a dynamic supply chain is formed vertically, mediating several companies for a project. Companies that are on the same level horizontally are either competitors or cohorts. A complex scenario such as this makes it challenging to find the right group of members for a dynamic supply chain. Earlier on, a multiagent model called the collaborative single machine earliness/tardiness (CSET) model was proposed for the optimal formation of make-to-order supply chains. This paper contributes the particular agent designs, for enabling the mediation of CSET in a supply mesh, and the possibilities are discussed.

Padre Tomás Pereira, Taipa, Macau","A new e-Service model called dynamic supply chain is characterized by their dynamic nature in easily being formed and disbanded with the seamless connectivity provided by e-Marketplace. The new term ""supply mesh"" was coined to represent this virtual community of companies in which dynamic supply chains, as per project (also known as make-to-order), are formed across different tiers of suppliers. In a supply mesh, a dynamic supply chain can be formed vertically, from the top to the bottom layers, mediating different companies for a project. Companies that are on the same level laterally are usually competitors, and the companies that are linked vertically as supply chains are trading partners. From a global view, the companies that are connected in the supply mesh can be viewed as individual entities that have self-interest. They may compete for survival as well as collaborate with each other for jobs. Given such complex relations the challenge is to find an optimal group of members for a dynamic supply chain in the supply mesh. A multi-agent model called the collaborative single machine earliness/tardiness (CSET) model was recently proposed for the optimal formation of make-to-order supply chains. This paper investigates the possibilities of applying CSET in a supply mesh, and the corresponding allocation schemes are experimentally studied in simulations. One scheme called Cost-driven principle leads to destructive competition while the other one namely Pareto-optimal evolves into a cooperative competition that tries to mutually benefit every participant. The results, based on samples from the U.S. textile industry, show that a cooperative competition scheme is superior in terms of optimal allocation, which obtains maximum satisfaction for all participants. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84882376002&doi=10.1007%2fs10796-012-9380-y&partnerID=40&md5=57497051340ff083a920752ceb43b7e9,Scopus

Different from conventional waste heat recovery (WHR), the mobile waste heat recovery (M-WHR) implanted recovery vehicles to facility heat collection and distribution. As a new and cost-sensitive channel for the WHR industry, the dynamic supply chain of the M-WHR has seldom been studied.

However, research on how strategic partnerships affect enterprise performance remains controversial. To address this issue, based on the supply chain management practices of Chinese enterprises in the era of the digital economy, and according to resource dependence theory, social network theory, and transaction cost theory, a chain multiple intermediary model was constructed and 243 Chinese enterprises information was collected for an empirical test. The results show that strategic partnership has a significant direct positive impact on information sharing, supply chain flexibility, and enterprise performance. Information sharing has a significant direct positive impact on enterprise performance and plays a partial mediating role between strategic partnership and enterprise performance. Supply chain flexibility was also found to positively impact enterprise performance and plays a partial mediating role between strategic partnership and enterprise performance. The findings also showed that information sharing and supply chain flexibility play a chain mediating role between strategic partnership and enterprise performance. This study explores the effects of strategic partnership on enterprise performance, which provides an important supplement to theoretical studies of supply chain management.

So, an interval valued fuzzy model was implemented. Third, to examine the proposed decision system in reality, it was applied in Risk and Uncertain Conditions for Agriculture Production Systems (RUC-APS) project. Contribution: An integrated version of QFD and GRA is presented. It is assumed that QFD can act to measure optimal solutions based on the distance to ideal solutions. In an interval-valued fuzzy environment the enormous volume of computation by Euclidean distance doesn't allow decision makers to obtain the results easily. This drawback is addressed using gray relational analysis. The gray relational coefficient is integrated to the fuzzy QFD to measure the distance of potential solutions from ideal solutions. This integration facilitates decision making process in further problems once big data are available. Results: To obtain the importance degrees of logistic indicators in the supply chain, expert team considered the environmental, social & cultural, and economic factors as external dimension of the QFD. The other dimension of QFD includes supply chain drivers such as quality, environmental management system, supply chain flexibility, corporate social responsibility, transportation service condition, and financial stability. The decision model is solved and the ranking of indicators is achieved. A sensitivity analysis helps to test and check the performance of the decision model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051957641&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2018.08.017&partnerID=40&md5=3df05db667b024e23a95ee6503b007ec,Scopus

With increasing market uncertainties, stakeholder complexities, constraints of resources, companies nowadays are required to develop more context-specific solutions for mitigating sustainability risk and improving market performance in supply chain sustainability practices. To address the challenges faced by businesses, this study aims to explore how a company adapts green supply chain strategies for a competitive transformation. Specifically, we aim to identify different green supply chain capabilities that form hybrid choices of green solutions for a company to leverage an adaptive green shift. Through an extensive literature review, this study proposes a conceptual framework for exploration which is based on a qualitative in-depth case study in the electronics industry—one of the most polluting manufacturing sectors in China. The findings show that supply chain characteristics play a significant role in the selection of different green SCM solutions by businesses. We find different hybrid choices of strategic decisions are being made by the case company operating with high-volume and high-value supply chains respectively. High-volume supply chains adopt both operational pollution and waste control strategies and incremental green product strategies to balance cost of operational change and develop a competitive eco-efficient market expansion. In contrast, high-value supply chains adopt radical green product innovation strategies and operational waste prevention strategies to balance cost of product innovation and build operational efficiency to expand in a competitive eco-differentiation market. A mix of dynamic capabilities involved in different supply chain green transformations are also identified. © 2022 by the authors.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137170729&doi=10.3390%2fsu14148640&partnerID=40&md5=07d92c34e1813520dc3493158a7cff5a,Scopus

The industry needs to have a sufficient degree of supply chain flexibility to cater to the demands in today’s dynamic environment and the flexibility in the supply chain will help event businesses to be sustainable. This study aims to explore the role of the supply chain flexibility fit between event planner’s requirements and supplier offerings on the implementation of green practices. The study also attempted to provide insights into the adoption of green event practices by identifying the moderating roles of green organization image and public pressure. Design/methodology/approach: Data analysis was conducted based on 207 useable responses from event planners. Polynomial regression and response surface analysis were performed to verify the hypothesized relationships. Additionally, hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the moderating effects of green organization image and public pressure on the proposed relationships. Findings: Results revealed that product flexibility fit was positively related to green practices; however, such effect was not found in the volume flexibility fit model. Findings also showed that public pressure significantly improved the positive effect of product flexibility fit on green practices. However, the green organization image was found to have no significant moderating effect. Practical implications: The adoption of green practices requires well-designed collaboration among supply chain partners. This study offers empirical evidence regarding the importance of achieving product flexibility fit between event planners’ requirements and supplier offerings when conducting green practices. The findings provide useful implications that can be applied for successful green event management. Originality/value: Despite the significance and relevance of the topic, barely any study has been conducted to assess supply chain flexibility and its relationship with green event practices.

In spite of Fisher's contribution to the literature, his study has rarely been extended into green supply chain contexts, except in a few conceptual arguments. The current study explores how Fisher's perspective of efficient versus responsive supply chains can be a stepping stone to the development of two green supply chains: eco-efficient and eco-responsive supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: Toward the above end, a case methodology is employed (Yin). Two Korean global companies, Pohang Iron and Steel Company (POSCO) and Samsung Electronics (SEC), are selected to explore eco-efficient and eco-responsive supply chains. POSCO (steel products) is selected to enable the understanding of how efficient and eco-efficient supply chains work. SEC (mobile phone products) is chosen to understand responsive and eco-responsive supply chains. Findings: The findings suggest that POSCO tends to stress process technology innovation as a means to address green pressures, while SEC accentuates the green product strategy; while an eco-efficient supply chain focuses on keeping to an environmental standard across the supply chains, an eco-responsive supply chain centers on the collaboration of suppliers and distributors in greening the supply chain; and SEC takes more initiatives to educate and encourage consumers to engage in recycling activities than POSCO does.

To test the mediating role of mutual trust between information sharing and information quality, this study uniquely examines four contexts of information sharing (receiving information from customers; receiving information from suppliers; providing information to customers; and providing information to suppliers). With two theoretical lenses, attribution theory and transaction cost theory, this study empirically investigates the interrelationships among information sharing, information quality, mutual trust, and supply chain flexibility with data from 74 Korean steel firms. The results suggest that: 1 attribution error (i.e., self-service bias) is likely to happen when it comes to providing information context 2 mutual trust plays a crucial role in transferring information sharing into information quality.

The strategic management of innovation process supposes achievement of competitive advantages based upon maximal usage of the experience of innovative supply chain activity organization and accounting of new factors, which influence on their change. To solve this problem have been analyzed conditions that determine the appearance and replace the six models of innovative process, allocated based on the modern world scientific experience.

The authors proposed a system of indicators to monitor the degree of manifestation of these effects in the study. In the course of the calculations have been identified changes in the patterns of the innovation process in the Russian mining and metallurgical complex and at the same time as there was a cumulative and complementary effect in changing patterns, and thus the efficiency of controlling innovation. The results suggest that the implementation of controlling innovation in mining and metallurgical enterprises cannot be called successful. Sustained growth was observed on single indicators.

Malaysia is one of the leading suppliers and has the largest palm oil plantation in the world. Therefore, biomass from the palm oil industry appears to be a very promising alternative source of raw materials, including for renewable energy, in Malaysia. However, ensuring the environmental sustainability of the biomass supply chain (BSC) is one of the major challenges faced by the biomass industry. Therefore, this paper aims to assess the effect of changing the efficiency of transportation technology (TT) and production technology (PT) on the environmental sustainability of the palm oil BSC. We developed a dynamic simulation model to explore the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 50 years (2000–2050) for three palm biomass suppliers (Johor, Perak and Pahang) in Malaysia. Results show that supplier in Perak produced the highest rate of GHG emissions in the whole system. Also, suppliers in Johor and Perak had the highest GHG emissions with 180–240 million tonnes (mt) CO2 equivalent (CO2e) and 375–400 mt CO2e, respectively, from transportation of empty fruit bunches (EFB) product. In terms of production, the supplier in Perak had the highest (and constant value) of GHG emissions (up to 160 mt CO2e). The analysis shows that the supplier in Pahang generated the lowest level of GHG emissions. Our findings suggest that improvement of the transportation and production efficiency of BSC should be the priority to work towards the sustainable development of the palm biomass industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069836409&doi=10.1016%2fj.jclepro.2019.117740&partnerID=40&md5=06c1961045dcf147e4a95eaa88d2db02,Scopus

There is widespread recognition that manufacturing in broad terms is entering a new period of transition and change, aided by new technologies and business models and with multiple predictions that there will be significant reconfigurations in the geographical and inclusive distribution of manufacturing operations. A concept that can be used to describe this process of transformation is called redistributed manufacturing. This concept encompasses the empowerment of consumer-inclusive co-creation. In this paper, we investigate whether and how big data can facilitate redistributed manufacturing in consumer goods industries. The research sheds light on how businesses are starting to redistribute their functions among various stakeholders including consumers and co-creating value. The paper proposes a conceptual framework to stimulate and organise thinking about emerging interrelationships between big data, co-creation and redistributed manufacturing, built upon an extensive literature review and qualitative analysis of 15 cases from the consumer goods industry using primary and secondary data. Through these cases, we analyse existing co-creation practices in consumer goods industries, and how they are evolving their manufacturing configurations, their underlying drivers, the role of big data applications, and their impacts on the redistribution of manufacturing.

The port is thus a strategic fit for the shipping of high-value and time-sensitive cargoes, and should pursue an agile strategy for a responsive supply chain.

The impact of advertising investment will last several planning periods besides the current period due to delay effect.

Co-op advertising programs usually involve two important contractual terms, a participation rate and an accrual rate. While previous literatures have discussed the participation rate excessively, they seldom study the role of the accrual rate in cooperative advertising. To investigate the impact of the accrual rate on cooperative advertising decisions, we develop a dynamic cooperative advertising model for a single manufacturer–single retailer supply chain that incorporates the participation rate and the accrual rate simultaneously. We derive the equilibrium co-op decisions of two channel members, including the manufacturer’s national advertising efforts and his participation rate, as well as the retailer’s local advertising expenditure. Our analysis of the equilibrium solutions shows that an increase in participation rate will not always increase the retailer’s advertising efforts because of the accrual rate. Also, both the manufacturer and retailer can benefit from a high accrual rate. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012865093&doi=10.1007%2fs13235-015-0165-z&partnerID=40&md5=9ef8e0095925cf69e35b7e52088100c8,Scopus

The hypotheses are empirically tested using multiple group structural equation modelling and data collected from 300 Chinese and 200 Indian manufacturers. Findings: The authors find that intellectual capital improves product innovation performance both directly and indirectly through supplier knowledge integration. However, the effects are different in China and India. In particular, the direct effect of intellectual capital on product innovation performance is significantly higher in China than that in India, and intellectual capital improves product innovation performance indirectly through supplier knowledge integration only in India.

We investigate a fuzzy robust strategy to realize the robust operation of the supply chain network with the production lead times and the ordering lead times under the uncertain customer demand. A discrete switched model of the dynamic supply chain network with the lead times and the uncertain customer demand is established based on T-S fuzzy systems. Then a fuzzy switched strategy is proposed to control the switching actions among subsystems. Furthermore, by introducing the inhibition rate γ, a fuzzy control strategy for the dynamic supply chain network is put forward to suppress the impacts of the lead times and the uncertain customer demand on the operation of the dynamic supply chain network. The fuzzy robust strategy composed of the fuzzy switched strategy and the fuzzy control strategy can guarantee the robust operation of the supply chain network at low cost.

Since some consumers and companies need a recommendation or prediction for future budget, labor and supply chain coordination, dynamic recommender systems for precise forecasting have become extremely necessary. In this article, we propose a new recommendation method, namely the dynamic tensor recommender system (DTRS), which aims particularly at forecasting future recommendation. The proposed method utilizes a tensor-valued function of time to integrate time and contextual information, and creates a time-varying coefficient model for temporal tensor factorization through a polynomial spline approximation. Major advantages of the proposed method include competitive future recommendation predictions and effective prediction interval estimations. In theory, we establish the convergence rate of the proposed tensor factorization and asymptotic normality of the spline coefficient estimator.

A consistent KPI framework was initially proposed to describe how the KPIs jointly assess OSC supply chains. The results indicate that previous research mainly focused on the economic aspect of OSC supply chains while social and environmental performance were largely overlooked. Under each aspect, several indicators were ascertained as frequently cited KPIs, while some others received relatively little attention. This paper contributes to a better understanding of OSC supply chain performance by investigating current measurement efforts from a multidimensional perspective. To practically develop a quantifiable assessment method, further research should build on the framework and pay more attention to the overall or total performance and the neglected KPIs, particularly in social and environmental aspects. © 2021 Proceedings of the International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction.

Internationally renowned companies such as IBM and Walmart have made significant achievements in supply chain management and have played a greater role in promoting the growth of their interests. However, while they are enjoying their own interests, they are also facing various risks in the supply chain. From the perspective of systems engineering, this paper uses complex network theory as a research tool to study supply chain networks and systematically study the important issues of supply chain network risks. This paper analyzes the new characteristics of the relationship between enterprises and suppliers in the supply chain and which indicators should be selected as the basis for evaluating suppliers from the perspective of cooperation and development, which more comprehensively reflects the characteristics of the new enterprise–supplier relationship in the supply chain environment. This highlights the evaluation of the supplier’s cooperation ability and development ability. Aiming at the problem of supply chain network system identification and integrated evaluation, a supply chain security evaluation model and index system research framework model are proposed, and the intercompany business risk and supply chain in supply chain network evaluation are introduced. As a model for evaluating transition parameters, the study of supply chain risk propagation introduces the theory of dynamic propagation in complex networks, the law of evolution, and the supplier's dynamic supply chain risk model. The experimental results of this paper show that when the global reputation value is 0.5 and the local reputation value is 0.8 and 0.7, the trust degree changes with the change of the confidence factor; when the value of the confidence factor decreases, the degree of trust converges more and more to the global reputation and vice versa.

Viewing supply chain networks as complex adaptive systems, we first construct and analyze a realworld supply chain network among 2,971 firms spanning 90 industry sectors. We then develop an agent-based simulation to show how the model of firms' adaptive behaviors can leverage competition relationships within a supply chain network. The simulation also models how disruptions propagate in the supply chain network through cascading failures. With the simulation, we seek to understand if a firm's adaptive behaviors can reduce the impact of disruptions in supply chain networks. Therefore, we propose, evaluate, and analyze two types of adaptive strategies a firm can leverage to reduce the negative effects of supply chain network disruptions. First, we deploy in our model a reactive strategy, which restructures the network in response to a disruption event among first-tier suppliers. Next, we develop and propose proactive strategies, which are used when a distant disruption is observed but has not yet hit the focal firm. We discuss the implications related to how and when firms can improve their resilience against supply disruptions by leveraging adaptive strategies. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066114963&doi=10.1002%2fjoom.1009&partnerID=40&md5=aabe7dba6e7b5b4a2b03221f58b37c92,Scopus

This paper combines Quality Function Deployment (QFD), fuzzy theory and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to guide practical design. After determining five customer requirements (CRs) and 24 design requirements (DRs), QFD links CRs and DRs to determine the most important feasible DRs for improvement of supply chain flexibility. Research results reveal that the most important design requirements can be summarized into four aspects, namely domestic procurement, supply chain member cooperation, supplier supervision, and emergency response construction.

Through this research work, we try to facilitate the assessment of reconfigurability based on its characteristics in order to determine the ability of the supply chain to cope with new emerging disruptions. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119453948&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-90700-6_7&partnerID=40&md5=7644ab7cf28ad2b244cfd6d5f4f45d2a,Scopus

They must also implement strategies that allows them to deal with these new challenges. Supply chain modularity offers the opportunity to change and reorganize the structure of the supply chain to meet changing market needs. In this paper, we propose a new framework to design a modular supply chain using Design Structure Matrix and a modularity measurement in Reconfigurable Supply Chain. We also show the importance of integrating the direction of flows, i.e. inbound and outbound flows in the calculation of modularity and, in particular, its impact on lead time.

Reconfigurability is used to measure quantitatively the capability of supply chain to change easily their structure and functions. The aim of this work is to evaluate the level of reconfigurability of a supply chain. Quantitative measures of six indicators that characterize reconfigurability are presented in this paper. Then, an index of reconfigurability in supply chain is developed based on The Multi-Attribute Utility Theory in order to choose the most reconfigurable configuration.

The proposed methodology consists of four steps during which an inflexible supply network constructed under nominal conditions progressively develops into a flexible network. First-stage variables are determined by a two-scenario mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model in which uncertain parameters deviate through specified ranges from their nominal values. The second-stage variables are determined by one-scenario Monte Carlo stochastic optimization. The approach is demonstrated on an illustrative case study of an agricultural biogas supply network with the objective being to maximize economic, eco- and viability profits. Flexible biogas supply networks with 28 uncertain parameters were achieved with acceptable computational effort. The expected economic and viability profits decreased compared to nominal profits by around 8%, while the eco-profit increased slightly as a result of higher utilization of less burdensome raw materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068854325&doi=10.1016%2fj.compchemeng.2019.06.028&partnerID=40&md5=8943cf29bc698b83b944cc9559745f69,Scopus

These can be disruptive as well as operational risks, but also business opportunities. To deal with uncertainties, various approaches suggest supply chains that are robust, resilient, and agile (RoRA). To accomplish this, flexibility is necessary. Aspects of flexibility in supply chain management (SCM) have been analyzed from different angles. But still a holistic concept on how flexibility planning can be integrated in the process of supply chain planning does not exist. This paper gives an overview on optimization models used for flexibility planning in supply chains and identifies the characteristics of such a planning process. Which tasks of SCM the components of flexibility planning have to be integrated in is discussed along the structure of the supply chain planning matrix. An outlook on further research on flexibility planning in RoRA-SCM is also given. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063101815&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-20863-3_4&partnerID=40&md5=4da7cbb0b1bfc710709d7e0236a4705d,Scopus

This is a crucial shortcoming that the study has taken a step to address, with the aim of advancing theory in BoP supply chain management (SCM). The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw on Carter et al.’s (2015) theory of the SC and use a multi-method approach combining systematic literature review and embedded case studies based on the secondary data. Findings: The authors compare BoP SC adaptations of MNCs, local companies, NGOs, social enterprises and governments and develop propositions. The authors find that SC adaptations exercised by BoP initiators are influenced by their sense making of institutional and agency drivers at the BoP, and contingent on whether the poor are engaged as recipients or value co-creators. Practical implications: The authors develop a multi-initiator understanding of SC adaptations for BoP business. This is useful for BoP initiators who struggle to leverage their BoP business as well as for those who are considering entering the BoP. The authors offer these entities insights for aligning strategy and developing capabilities for BoP markets. Originality/value: The authors develop an original model of BoP initiator-based configurations of SC adaptations for BoP business. As such, the authors contribute toward advancing BoP SCM theory and practice by mapping substantive concepts and their relationships associated with BoP SC adaptations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061398581&doi=10.1108%2fIJPDLM-01-2018-0045&partnerID=40&md5=b37f91f6077c4bda64ebe3b6b1ad7ce5,Scopus

This paper presents a new decision making approach for group multi-criteria supplier selection problem, which clubs supplier selection process with order allocation for dynamic supply chains to cope market variations. More specifically, the developed approach imitates the knowledge acquisition and manipulation in a manner similar to the decision makers who have gathered considerable knowledge and expertise in procurement domain. Nevertheless, under many conditions, exact data are inadequate to model real-life situation and fuzzy logic can be incorporated to handle the vagueness of the decision makers. As per this concept, fuzzy-AHP method is used first for supplier selection through four classes (CLASS I: Performance strategy, CLASS II: Quality of service, CLASS III: Innovation and CLASS IV: Risk), which are qualitatively meaningful. Thereafter, using simulation based fuzzy TOPSIS technique, the criteria application is quantitatively evaluated for order allocation among the selected suppliers. As a result, the approach generates decision-making knowledge, and thereafter, the developed combination of rules order allocation can easily be interpreted, adopted and at the same time if necessary, modified by decision makers. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, an illustrative example is presented and the results analyzed. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In our models, the market demand is assumed to be affected by the goodwill, reference price, and the advertising investment, in which the advertising investment can promote the construction of goodwill and such goodwill can further enhance the reference price. The results show that the participating members in the supply chain should invest more in advertisement to improve the goodwill and the relative reference price reflected in the minds of consumers. A far-sighted manufacturer will invest more in the advertisement and charge a higher wholesale price regardless of the behavior choice of the retailer.

This paper considers an innovation in dynamic supply-chain design and operations: connected smart factories that share interchangeable processes through a cloud-based system for personalized production. In the system, customers are able to upload a product design file, an optimal supply chain design and operations plan are then determined based on the available resources in the network of smart factories. The concept of smart supply chains is discussed and six types of flexibilities are identified, namely: design flexibility, product flexibility, process flexibility, supply chain flexibility, collaboration flexibility, and strategic flexibility. Focusing on supply chain flexibility, a general planning framework and various optimization models for dynamic supply chain design and operations plan are proposed. Further, numerical experiments are conducted to analyze fixed, production, and transportation costs for various scenarios. The results demonstrate the extent of the dynamic supply chain design and operations problem, and the large variation in transportation cost.",http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app8040583,Web of Science

Despite the growing number of publications about supply chain flexibility in the area of supply chain management, there is a lack of consensus on how to define and to conceptualize supply chain flexibility from a management point of view. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview of the literature on the supply chain flexibility perspective and contributes to our understanding of the current state of research and its future development. Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology used is the systematic literature review. In total 92 articles were selected from databases of well-known journal publishers in the field of economics, business studies and management sciences as well as grey literature to cover the topic of supply chain flexibility. Findings - A limited number of studies in the field of supply chain flexibility apply theories and define the term supply chain flexibility. Instead they focus on a particular part or dimension of the supply chain. Based on the analysis, a distinction is made between flexibility in the supply chain and supply chain flexibility. Based on the function and characteristics of the supply chain, the authors selected 30 flexibility dimensions that cover supply chain flexibility by concentrating on the different business areas involved. Research limitations/implications - The results support researchers and practitioners by identifying relevant trends and gaps in the field of supply chain flexibility. Originality/value - The authors review the dimensions and aspects of supply chain flexibility that are currently taken into account in the literature.

We ground our investigation in the dynamic capabilities view and contingency theory. We find that supply chain agility and supply chain adaptability positively affect both cost performance and operational performance. We further find evidence for a mediating role of supply chain agility in the links between supply chain adaptability and performance. Product complexity positively moderates the links between supply chain adaptability and cost performance, and supply chain adaptability and operational performance. The results contribute to the literature by offering a more nuanced understanding of the performance implications of supply chain agility and supply chain adaptability, thereby addressing the crucial question of why their benefits may or may not materialise under varying levels of product complexity.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2014.970707,Web of Science

It is suitable for meeting time-sensitive demands, such as the outbreak of disasters or epidemics/pandemics. Compared to traditional manufacturing, FiB poses a new challenge of frequently reconfiguring supply chain networks since the final production location changes as the vehicle carrying the factory travels. Supply chain network reconfiguration involves decisions regarding whether suppliers or manufacturers can be retained in the supply chain or replaced. Such a supply chain reconfiguration problem is coupled with manufacturing process planning, which assigns tasks to each manufacturer that impacts material flow in the supply chain network. Considering the supply chain reconfigurability, this article develops a new mathematical model based on nonlinear integer programming to optimize supply chain reconfiguration and assembly planning jointly. An evolutionary algorithm (EA) is developed and customized to the joint optimization of process planning and supplier/manufacturer selection. The performance of EA is verified with a nonlinear solver for a relaxed version of the problem. A case study on producing a medical product demonstrates the methodology in guiding supply chain reconfiguration and process planning as the final production site relocates in response to local demands.

This study investigates the impact of supply chain integration on business performance through supply chain resilience, supply chain flexibility, and innovation system in Indonesia's manufacturing companies. Data collection has obtained as many as 470 questionnaires considered valid for further analysis. Data analysis used the partial least square (PLS) technique using smartPLS software version 3.0.

This paper aims contribute to this field by investigating green supply chain flexibility achievement through information systems. This paper introduces a green supply chain flexibility matrix framework. Given the large data needs, as described in the matrix, a novel probability evaluation methodology that can help predict rankings of projects and programs is introduced. The methodology extends a TOPSIS based three-parameter interval grey number (TpGN) approach by incorporating neighborhood rough set theory (RST) to evaluate IS programs' green flexibility support capability.

However, recent studies suggest that the operational challenges associated with meeting this objective may be heavily dependent not only upon a firm's internal modification, mix, and new product flexibilities, but also upon the flexibility of its inbound and outbound supply chain partners. Drawing upon the theory of Complementarity, we examine if simultaneous utilization of both internal and external flexibilities does in fact create synergies that can improve a firm's delivery performance. Based on a sample of 158 U.S. manufacturing plants, we find that the extent to which performance enhancing synergies are generated is primarily dependent upon the type of internal flexibility that is paired with supply chain flexibilities. Additionally, we find that when synergies do exist, external supplier and logistics flexibilities generally tend to enhance the scope of flexible response, while internal flexibilities generally tend to enhance the achievability of a flexible response. Taken together, our findings suggest that the ability of firms to actually reap the synergistic benefits of an integrated system of supply chain flexibility is much more complex and nuanced than previously believed or expected.

These supply chains, which are called supply mesh, generally refer to heterogeneous electronic marketplaces in which dynamic supply chains, as per project (often make-to-order), are formed across different parties. Conceptually, in a supply mesh a dynamic supply chain is formed vertically, mediating several companies for a project. Companies that are on the same level horizontally are either competitors or cohorts.

We try to connect operation issues with sustainability in this paper. From the perspective of the dynamic capabilities of the firm, this study suggests a conceptual model that presents relationships among supply chain visibility, modular design, supply chain flexibility, and agility. We do not focus on the module buyer but on the small and middle-sized enterprises (SMEs). An empirical study is performed to verify the relationships proposed, using datasets collected from 232 manufacturing SMEs as module suppliers in South Korea. We used SPSS to analyze data and structural equation modeling to verify the hypotheses of the research model. The important contributions of this study are as follows. Firstly, we suggest relationships among supply chain visibilities and a modular design for supply chain flexibility and agility in sustainable performance. Secondly, we show that supply chain visibility directly leads firms to implement modular design in sustainable development. Thirdly, we verify the importance of supply chain visibility, not for module buyers, but for module suppliers by switching views in terms of SMEs' sustainability. Lastly, this study shows that the suppliers' modular design affects supply chain flexibility and agility, which is consistent with the findings presented in the literature.",http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10020572,Web of Science

This supply chain design requires the development of flexibility as a critical capability. To this end, firms are considering Additive Manufacturing (AM) as one strategic option that could enable such a capability. This paper develops a conceptual model that maps AM characteristics relevant to flexibility against key market disruption scenarios. Following the development of this model, a case study is undertaken to indicate the impact of adopting AM on supply chain flexibility from four major flexibility-related aspects: volume, mix, delivery, and new product introduction. An inter-process comparison is implemented in this case study using data collected from a manufacturing company that produces pipe fittings using Injection Moulding (IM). The supply chain employing IM in this case study shows greater volume and delivery flexibility levels (i.e., 65.68% and 92.8% for IM compared to 58.70% and 75.35% for AM, respectively) while the AM supply chain shows greater mix and new product introduction flexibility, indicated by the lower changeover time and cost of new product introduction to the system (i.e., 0.33 h and euro0 for AM compared to 4.91 h and euro30,000 for IM, respectively).

Following large-scale and catastrophic disasters, local organisations integrate with other responding organisations to form hastily disaster relief supply chain networks. Such supply networks are infrequently activated in a single location, generate unparalleled uncertainty, change quickly, and are driven by the urgency of saving lives and restoring livelihoods. Unfortunately, even where sound supply chain management practices are used, supply networks have encountered diverse levels of resilience and adequate disaster relief performance has remained elusive. In this paper, several unique characteristics that disaster relief efforts exhibit are examined as compared with demand-driven, steady-state supply chains. Important differences in the flows of resource, money, and information are identified. A complex adaptive supply network (CASN) lens is used to frame what existing literature has uncovered regarding disaster relief efforts, showing how relief organisations, their interactions, and their environmental context help determine the level of resilience that supply networks experience following disasters. This CASN characterisation is leveraged to help explain why traditional supply chain management practices lead to varied results in disaster relief. Finally, complexity science theory is drawn on to set forth eight testable propositions that may help to enhance supply network resilience.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2013.787496,Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach - This research employs two complementary theoretical lenses frequently used in the explanation of relationship performance, resource-based view of the firm and strategic behavior theory. The authors then used an international survey based in three Northern European countries to test their hypotheses with hierarchical linear regression. Findings - The quantitative analysis supports all three hypotheses indicating that supply chain portfolio flexibility is an important determinant for small-to-medium-sized firm satisfaction with supply chain portfolio performance. Additionally, firm alliance orientation and entrepreneurial orientation both significantly influence the relationship between supply chain flexibility and performance satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - This research is limited by the categorization of the supply chain portfolio flexibility types as high and low resource linkages by the researchers. Future research may look at additional ways to measure individual agreements and have firms categorize them according to resource requirements. However, the findings of this research provide a theoretical and empirical foundation through the application of resource-based view of the firm and strategic behavior theory for future research in the area of small-to-medium-sized firms and their satisfaction with supply chain portfolios.

This research indicates that it makes sense for managers to consider categorizing supply chain relationships similar to the way they categorize their end-user relationships.

Design/methodology/approach Data on the consumption of cement and site works for 100 ongoing building construction sites were gathered for a period of 12 months. The variance partitioning capabilities of the Ordinary Least Squares and Hierarchical Linear Modelling forms of regression analysis are comparatively used to evaluate the sensitivity of cement demand to the meteorological profile of wet-humid climate Findings The study outcome provides statistical evidence demonstrating that the meteorological profile of wet-humid climate induces a significantly high percentage of the variance in the real-time demand for bagged cement on construction sites. However, nested within this variance, are the fixed effects of the cement footprint of the building architecture inherent in the locality. Particularly, positive changes to reduce the wet trade composition of buildings or compensating changes in technological bias, are necessary to combat weather interference in the humid tropics.

Being able to fully understand both the complex static and dynamic structures of a complex adaptive supply network (CASN) are key to being able to make more informed management decisions and prioritize resources and production throughout the network. Previous efforts to model and analyze CASN have been impeded by the complex, dynamic nature of the systems. However, drawing from other complex adaptive systems sciences, information theory provides a model-free methodology removing many of those barriers, especially concerning complex network structure and dynamics. With minimal information about the network nodes, transfer entropy can be used to reverse engineer the network structure while local transfer entropy can be used to analyze the network structure's dynamics. Both simulated and real-world networks were analyzed using this methodology. Applying the methodology to CASNs allows the practitioner to capitalize on observations from the highly multidisciplinary field of information theory which provides insights into CASN's self-organization, emergence, stability/instability, and distributed computation.

To adapt to this dynamic environment, supply chains have become increasingly reliant on collaboration, integration, flexibility, and trust between stakeholders. Therefore, the importance of new technological applications in supply chains has grown even more. To improve supply chain flow control, modern specialized applications must be implemented. Blockchain technology has established itself as a necessary component of today's competitive environment. Companies should invest in blockchain technology to respond quickly to changing market conditions and demands in today's dynamic business environment. In this regard, this study investigates the effect of blockchain technology utilization on supply chain transparency, supply chain flexibility, and trust in suppliers. For this purpose, first, data were collected from the first 1000 exporting firms declared in 2019 by the Turkey Exporters Assembly using a survey method. Secondly, factor analyses and regression analyses were performed with the dataset obtained from 84 companies. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that blockchain technology utilization increases transparency, flexibility, and trust in supply chains. According to these results, it is suggested that companies should invest in blockchain technology to make their supply chain more transparent, flexible, and secure. Moreover, blockchain plays a crucial role in building mutual trust with supply chain stakeholders. Finally, the research includes some considerations on the positive implications and potential of blockchain in collaboration and integration.",http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/logistics5020033,Web of Science

Based on the definition of an appropriate web-based application, the infrastructure is able to connect the possible client requests and the relative supply chain product/process development capabilities and then attempt to find the best available solutions. In particular, the main goal of the developed system, called AMSA (Additive Manufacturing Spare parts market Application), is the definition of a common platform to supply different kinds of services that have the following common reference points in the Additive Manufacturing Technologies (DFAM, Design For Additive Manufacturing): product development, prototypes, or small series production and reverse engineering activities to obtain Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models starting from a physical object. The definition of different kinds of services allows satisfying several client needs such as innovative product definition characterized by high performance in terms of stiffness/weight ratio, the possibility of manufacturing small series, such as in the motorsport field, and the possibility of defining CAD models for the obsolete parts for which the geometrical information is missed. The AMSA platform relies on the reconfigurable supply chain that is dynamic, and it depends on the client needs. For example, when the client requires the manufacture of a small series of a component, AMSA allows the technicians to choose the best solutions in terms of delivery time, price, and logistics. Therefore, the suppliers that contribute to the definition of the dynamic supply chain have an important role. For these reasons, the AMSA platform represents an important and innovative tool that is able to link the suppliers to the customers in the best manner in order to obtain services that are characterized by a high-performance level. Therefore, a provisional model has been implemented that allows filtering the technologies according to suitable performance indexes. A specific aspect for which AMSA can be considered unique is related with the given possibility to access Design for Additive Manufacturing Services through the Web in accordance with the possible additive manufacturing technologies.",http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met11030409,Web of Science

The supply chain is represented as an optimization model that maximizes the revenue of manufacturers meets the retailers' demand and at the same time identifies the necessary warehouses, particularly for supply chains that are affected by leadtime (LT) variation such as fast response industry and short life products. The model solution is adaptive; it determines the best manufacturing rates and identifies the logistic bottlenecks in dynamic supply chain networks.

The change in the production system is accompanied by new logistical needs related both to resources and waste and to the distribution and recovery of products. The circular supply chain involves return processes and the manufacturer intends to capture additional value in the supply chain. In this paper, value chains have been mapped to visualize the links and interactions between the different stages and actors to understand the complexities of these systems and to make informed decisions. For this reason, and based on thorough literature review, the final objective of this work is to achieve a conceptual framework to study circular supply chain, which uses the main theoretical perspectives in strategic management literature. Four dimensions have been identified to support the development of these new supply chains-greater intensity in the relationships established in the supply chain, adaptation of logistics and organizational, disruptive and smart technologies, and a functioning environment. It can be concluded that to develop a new relationship capacity will allow for reaching more frequent, closer relationships with more actors. These relationships will be developed within an adapted organizational and logistical framework that is framed in new business model archetypes.

This paper proposes an event-based model which lists the events related with all phases of cooperation with partners and puts events into a dynamic supply chain network in order to understand factors that affect supply chain partnership integration. We develop a multi-objective supply chain partnership integration problem by maximizing trustworthiness, supplier service, qualified products rate and minimizing cost, and then, apply a hybrid algorithm (PSACO) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO) that aims to efficiently solve the problem. It combines the advantages of PSO with reliable global searching capability and ACO with great evolutionary ability and positive feedback. By using the actual data from 1688.com, experimental studies are carried out. The parameter optimizing of the hybrid algorithm is firstly deployed and then we compare the problem solution results of PSACO with the original PSO, ACO.

Despite its relevance in practice, characterizing the optimal dual sourcing policy is extremely challenging, and the optimal stochastic policy for nonconsecutive lead times has been unknown for over 50 years. Methodology: We present and solve a robust rolling horizon model for periodically reviewed dual sourcing inventory systems that minimizes the total cost of purchasing, inventory holding, and backlogging. Results: We prove that the optimal robust policy is a dual-index, dual-base-stock policy that constrains or caps the slow order and provide closed-form expressions for the three control parameters. The optimality result is established for general lead times and can accommodate nonstationary demand. Our numerical study shows that, as the lead time difference grows, the capped dual index policy increasingly smooths slow orders and for stationary demand, converges to the tailored base-surge policy, which places a constant slow order and has been shown to be asymptotically optimal.

It is one of essential features that affect the results of the functioning of a supply chain. Many researchers indicate adaptability as a significant source of acquiring and maintaining a long-term competitive advantage, one of major factors that guarantee the success of a supply chain, or a major development megatrend of supply chains. The main objective of the article is to analyse the impact of such factors as industry and applied competitive strategy (cost leadership, differentiation, or focus) on the level of supply chain performance and results achieved by the supply chain with regard to the key aspects of performance in the context of adaptability. Methods: In the article the author analyses results of studies conducted with CATI method at a sample of 200 enterprises representing four industries: automotive, food, furniture as well as consumer electronics and household appliances, which are among most advanced sectors in the Polish economy (leaders of Polish export). The analysis of data gathered was carried out at a few stages. Firstly, a hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis was applied. The developed model was used for measuring and assessing the performance of supply chains and its dimensions by means of designating factor scores. The last stage involved studying the impact of such factors as type of industry or applied competitive strategy on the level of performance and its four dimensions: visibility, velocity, versatility, and responsiveness. At this stage the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Results: The results of the conducted studies provided evidence that the level of supply chain performance as well as its four dimensions is not affected by the type of industry, but vary in accordance to the applied competitive strategy. Conclusions: The model, developed and positively verified in terms of quality, may constitute a useful tool for management practitioners to measure and assesses the performance of specific supply chains, as well as make comparisons between them. Thanks to determining factors that affect the level of performance and its four dimensions, managers may as well consciously indicate directions in improving supply chains.",http://dx.doi.org/10.17270/J.LOG.2021.584,Web of Science

We then validate our model using survey data. The results indicate that service supply chain acts as both moderator and mediator for the relationship between operant resources and firm performance.

An effective way to manage uncertainty and variance in operational and organizational systems is by introducing greater flexibility. The literature on flexibility in reverse logistics is surprisingly sparse, with an explicit focus on flexibility in reverse logistics nonexistent in the literature. To address this gap in the literature, and building upon literature in supply chain flexibility, we introduce a reverse logistics flexibility framework. The framework is separated into operational and strategic flexibilities. Operational flexibility includes a variety of dimensions such as product and volume flexibility across various reverse logistics operational functions. We have also included strategic flexibility categorized into network and organizational design flexibility dimensions. Additional sub-dimensions are also included in the framework. The framework is useful for practical managerial decision making purposes such as process improvement or programmatic evaluation. The framework is also useful as a theoretical construct for reverse logistics empirical research. To exemplify the practical utility of the framework we introduce a performance evaluation of third party reverse logistics providers model using a novel neighborhood rough set approach. Using illustrative data, sensitivity results help evaluate the neighborhood rough set technique's robustness with various reverse logistics performance factors.

We then examine the impact of mean learning rate and learning rate variability on the pricing strategies of the channel members, on the manufacturer's production decisions, and on the retailer's procurement decisions. We show that as the mean learning rate or the learning rate variability increases, the traditional double marginalization problem becomes more severe, leading to greater efficiency loss in the channel. We obtain revenue sharing contracts that can coordinate the dynamic supply chain.

However, it lacks an acceptable generic standard. Supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model is a cross-functional framework widely accepted as an industry standard. It provides the standard processes, performance metrics, best practices and associated software functionalities for modelling, evaluating and improving supply chain networks. However, it is a static tool. Integration of agent-based distributed simulation and SCOR model can exploit their advantages to form a generic methodology for modelling and simulation of a wide range of supply chain networks. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology for distributed supply chain network modelling and simulation by means of integration of agent-based distributed simulation and an improved SCOR model. The methodology contains two components: a hierarchical framework for modelling supply chain network based on the improved SCOR model and agent building blocks integrating the standard processes from the SCOR model. The hierarchical framework provides an approach for structure modelling in any level with different granularities based on the improved SCOR model, and allows rapidly mapping a supply chain network into the structure model of a multi-agent system; while agent building blocks are quite useful and convenient to fill the structure model to fulfil its function modelling. With the approach of structure modelling and function filling, not only can the process of agent-based supply chain network modelling be accelerated, but also the built models can be reused and expanded. Because the hierarchical framework is based on the conceptual framework of SCOR model and agent building blocks integrate the standard processes from SCOR model, the proposed methodology is more generic. In addition, the issues of sub-model synchronisation and data distribution management in the agent-based distributed simulation implementation are taken into consideration and the corresponding solutions for these issues are proposed. Finally, an example of a supply chain network is modelled and implemented to illustrate the proposed methodology and related solutions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2014.910623,Web of Science

However most of the studies assume a linear supply chain with a single reverse flow of returns, which is a simplification that may not hold in most of the existent supply chains, which often show more complex structures with several flows of returns. When there are several return flows, a critical decision for the supply chain dynamic performance is whether the remanufacturing process should be centralised (i.e. a single facility jointly remanufactures the returns from all the locations) or decentralised (i.e. the remanufacturing takes place independently in each location). This paper explores the impact of this critical decision on the performance of a divergent closed-loop supply chain with several point-of-sales and reverse flows. A simulation model is developed considering different return rates, information transparency levels, and number of nodes in the supply chain. Findings reveal that a centralized configuration reduces the uncertainty in the reverse flows of remanufactured products, smoothing the production orders of the involved organizations and improving their inventory performance. As a drawback, upstream members of the supply chain may face a higher uncertainty due to some correlation of orders. As such, this configuration may not be recommended in long supply chains with a significant number of return flows and high average return volumes, unless there is a high transparency of information. Furthermore, guidelines for managers are provided in order to reduce the bullwhip effect when implementing these circular economy practices. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the study described in this paper was to develop a conceptual framework that adopts performance measures for ex-ante decision-making at an operational level within the supply chain. To guide the research, five questions were asked and subsequently key gaps have been identified. In an attempt to fill the gaps, a case study at a major global brand beverage company has been carried out, and as a result, a conceptual framework of the PMS has been developed. Overall, the research offers a foundation of the applicability and impact of PMS in the supply chain and provides a framework that attends to some of the potential uses of PMS that so far have not been practically applied. The outcomes from the testing indicate that the initial gaps identified in the literature have been addressed and that the framework is judicious with scope for practical applicability. The framework is deemed worthy of further testing in different operational contexts of the supply chain.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2015.1076944,Web of Science

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are useful to enhance such network capabilities thorough effective information flows. Their intended goals are measured in terms of production costs, operational flexibility and supply chain performance outcomes. However, the impact of ERP system implementation on firm performance has been reported as somewhat inconclusive. This study contends that a missing link in the story is the scope and extent of ERP system implementation after investigating how the extent of ERP integration is associated with the performance outcomes of manufacturing firms. The study also posits that restructuring in the organisation and supply chains are positively associated with manufacturing performance. Since ERP often entails restructuring in an organisation and supply chains, it is anticipated that restructuring plays an important role in inducing positive impact of ERP implementation to the firm. Using a global sample of 641 manufacturers, this research identifies four distinct ERP systems integration patterns, epitomised by different extents and directions of integration, and finds a significant association among the broadest degree of ERP systems integration, restructuring and plant performance improvement. The empirical results also show that restructuring takes place most actively in a firm that implement ERP with widest scope and scale.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537287.2014.950624,Web of Science

The contribution of this research is to explore and evaluate sustainable agility in supply chains for a dairy manufacturing organization located in Saudi Arabia. Other contributions of this research are to update the literature about the different factors contributing to achieve agile supply chain, propose conceptual framework and assessment approach incorporating the relationships between sustainable supply-chain capabilities, enablers, and attributes, and shortlisting the agility barriers and how they would facilitate manufacturing organizations' performance. The paper presents supply chain agility evaluation approach, which covers identification of agile supply-chain capabilities and drivers. It also presents a conceptual model and a framework to define agility level and barriers within the supply-chain. In the paper, fuzzy logic approach is preferred, owing to its capability to incorporate and deal with problems involving impreciseness and vagueness phenomena. Threshold-value in this study for the case organization is set to 0.24829. The outcome of the adopted approach indicates that 21 attributes performed below the threshold value; these attributes are further categorized as agility barriers. These are the barriers within their supply chain that impact the agility-level. For the case organization, the foremost priority is to enhance maintainability and serviceability to make it flexible and inexpensive to establish an agile responsive supply chain. At the same time, it should have priority to focus on development and integration of their core competencies to deal with cross-functional and cross-enterprise issues in supply chain.

Survey data from a sample of 148 firms, in the garment manufacturing industry, in Pakistan were analyzed using partial least square methods.

To understand the influence of operating variables on the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water consumption, a dynamic supply chain model was linked with life cycle assessment (LCA) to produce an environmental inventory. Water is a critical natural resource, and understanding the environmental impacts of recycling water is paramount in continued development of sustainable supply chains involving water. The methodology used in this study bridged the gap between detailed process models and static LCA modeling so that operating variables beyond discrete scenario analysis could be investigated without creating unnecessarily complex models. The model performed well in evaluating environmental impacts. It was found that there was no single optimum operating regime for all environmental impacts. For a mill discharging 80 cubic meters of effluent per hour (m(3)/hour), GHGs could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 17.5 m(3)/hour, while water consumption could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 25 m(3)/hour, which allowed insight into where environmental trade-offs would occur. The study shows that more complexity can be achieved in supply chain modeling without requiring a full technical model.

The two-part tariff contract is designed to coordinate the supply chain and to improve the supply chain performance. Moreover, we discuss the influence of different power structures and the two-part tariff contract on the optimal decisions and profits. Finally, numerical analysis is used to verify the conclusions.

It is imperative and prudent to look at the overall product chain rather than focusing on any single supply chain entity. From a supply chain perspective, it is crucial that these individual entities are lean and agile (leagile) themselves, as well as the overall product value chain. As a result of the global nature of the product value chain, the concept of the decoupling point has undergone a paradigm shift. Through the literature review the authors establish three different types of decoupling point existing in product value chains, namely: (1) product structure decoupling point (PSDP), bill of materials decoupling; (2) supply structure decoupling point (SSDP), supply network decoupling; and (3) demand transfer decoupling point (DTDP), associated with information sharing. It is argued that such decoupling points are already an established and accepted phenomena, but have not been comprehensively discussed until now. It is proposed that, in the global supply chain, PSDP and SSDP are elemental decoupling points and DTDP is a logical decoupling, which is a function of PSDP and SSDP. It is proposed that DTDP swings between PSDP and SSDP and the swing direction is a critical piece of supply chain information that helps identify distortion. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) method is proposed to discover the relationship of DTDP with SSDP and PSDP using interpretation matrices and stress coefficients. Considering the supply chain as a fuzzy system, a combined effect of MDS over fuzzy applications has been used to determine the extent of swing of DTDP in the particular application of the supply chain.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2011.588624,Web of Science

Green production adopts green technology, which comprises environmentally friendly inventions that are used to reduce emissions. Green production is more costly than regular production, but it generates lower emissions. The production rate is adjustable, which enables decision makers to control the emissions and production cost.

An international survey containing data on 470 manufacturing subsidiaries is used to operationalize the constructs. Structural equation modeling provides evidence for a full mediation model: external integration mediates the positive impact of internal integration on performance. Based on the results, it is put forward that knowledge generated within the internal manufacturing network can only be converted into subsidiary-level operational performance, if it is shared and recombined with external supply chain partners. The highest performance benefits can only be achieved if both suppliers and customers are involved in this process. A limitation of our approach is that knowledge flows are measured indirectly by assessing the level of integration of a subsidiary in the knowledge flows within the internal network, and the level of integration with suppliers and customers.

We model the dynamics of disruptions as Markov chains, and consider a multiproduct, multisupplier supply chain under dynamic disruption risks. Using our model, we first show that a little flexibility in the backup system can go a long way in mitigating dynamic disruption risks. This raises an important and fundamental question in designing flexibility in the backup system: to achieve the benefits of full backup flexibility, which unreliable suppliers should be backed up? To answer this question, we connect the supply chain to various queueing and dam models by analyzing the dynamics of the inventory shortfall process. Using this connection, we show that backing up suppliers merely based on first moment considerations such as their average reliability or average product demand can be misleading. All else equal, it is better to back up suppliers with (1) longer but less frequent disruptions, and (2) lower demand uncertainty. In addition to such second moment effects, by employing the Renyi's Theorem, we demonstrate that when disruptions are relatively long (if they occur), backing up the suppliers for which the expected wasted backup capacity is minimum provides the best backup flexibility design. We also develop easy-to-compute and yet effective indices that (a) guide the supply chain designer in deciding which suppliers to backup, and (b) provide insights into the role of various factors such as inventory holding and shortage costs, purchasing costs, suppliers reliabilities, and product demand distributions in designing backup flexibility.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1478,Web of Science

Such dynamism leads to new challenges in security and dependability. Collaborating services in a system with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) may belong to different security realms but often need to be engaged dynamically at runtime. If their security realms do not have a direct cross-realm authentication relationship, it is technically difficult to enable any secure collaboration between the services. A potential solution to this would be to locate intermediate realms at runtime, which serve as an authentication path between the two separate realms. However, the process of generating an authentication path for two distributed services can be highly complicated. It could involve a large number of extra operations for credential conversion and require a long chain of invocations to intermediate services. In this paper, we address this problem by designing and implementing a new cross-realm authentication protocol for dynamic service interactions, based on the notion of service-oriented multiparty business sessions. Our protocol requires neither credential conversion nor establishment of any authentication path between the participating services in a business session. The correctness of the protocol is formally analyzed and proven, and an empirical study is performed using two production-quality Grid systems, Globus 4 and CROWN. The experimental results indicate that the proposed protocol and its implementation have a sound level of scalability and impose only a limited degree of performance overhead, which is for example comparable with those security-related overheads in Globus 4.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2010.33,Web of Science

This paper aims to demonstrate how a deep reinforcement learning agent based on the proximal policy optimization algorithm can synchronize inbound and outbound flows and support business continuity operating in the stochastic and nonstationary environment if end-to-end visibility is provided. The deep reinforcement learning agent is built upon the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, which does not require hardcoded action space and exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. These features, complimented with a straightforward supply chain environment, give rise to a general and task unspecific approach to adaptive control in multi-echelon supply chains. The proposed approach is compared with the base-stock policy, a well-known method in classic operations research and inventory control theory. The base-stock policy is prevalent in continuous-review inventory systems. The paper concludes with the statement that the proposed solution can perform adaptive control in complex supply chains. The paper also postulates fully fledged supply chain digital twins as a necessary infrastructural condition for scalable real-world applications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/a14080240,Web of Science

This Study provides a strategic perspective for devising the supply chain strategies (SCS), in coordination to the competitive strategies (CS), targeting the desired performance objectives. The strategic fit/alignment between CS and SCS in Pakistani wireless internet industry was explored and the influence of these alignments on the performance was investigated. An adapted survey questionnaire was used and 77 respondents from 8 companies in Pakistan participated in the survey. General Linear Regression Model (GLM) was used to extract and interpret results. Major findings show high correlations between competitive and supply chain strategies alignments. It is also found that choice of combination between CS and SCS affects business and supply chain performance. Implementation of supply chain management (SCM) practices in Pakistani wireless industry are mainly stalled by Traditional Practices (mostly ranked top), Leadership, (drops the organizational performance) and Time Constraint, Low Budget & Expenditure, and Resources (boost the organizational performance). A convenient sampling technique is used to collect the information through the adapted questionnaire. Supply chain managers can opt the best combination of CS and SCS dimensions in the presence of hurdles; he/she is facing before implementation of new business strategy to improve the organizational performance.

However, the ambiguity of information and the different goals of stakeholders demand that the humanitarian supply chain must be resilient. This research adopts the use of literature review and expert opinions to identify the indicators that affect the resilience of the humanitarian supply chain using the flood event in Hechuan District, China in 2020 as an example. Based on the combination of fuzzy Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and Analytic Network Process (fuzzy-DEMATEL-ANP), the interrelationships between the indicators and the weights of each indicator are calculated. The research results indicate that decision-makers in the humanitarian supply chain should vigorously coordinate the cooperation among stakeholders, ensure the effective transmission of information, and formulate forward-looking strategic plans. At the same time, these key decision makers should also be aware of the need to adjust their strategies at different stages of the flooding event in order to achieve a flexible humanitarian supply chain that responds to the varying demands over the course of a flooding event.

Nevertheless, one of the ensuing key challenges of flexible-electronics-based sensing is the issues associated with consistency and repeatability of its parameters of the flexible electronics elements/sensors due to their variations, which are sometimes intractable. These may be due to manufacturing variations, aging, when the substrate is bent, and so on. In this article, we describe our codesign between the different chains of the flexible electronics supply chain to derive practically flexible electronics and sensors for applications where the substrate is expected to bend, e.g., in an augmented sensing e-skin smart glove application. This effort includes our fully additive low-temperature all-air low-cost screen printing process, and how we obtain consistency and repeatability. To improve the matching of thin-film transistors-a critical consideration for conditioning sensor outputs-we describe layout techniques where relatively good matching can be achieved, but with area overheads. We describe how we accommodate the variations of printed elements and circuits embodying printed elements when the substrate is bent-a self-compensating means-and propose the application of the same for printed sensors. The cost of our self-compensation means is without power or area overheads, albeit more (uncomplicated) printing steps. We finally describe our process development kit (PDK) encompassing all of the aforesaid to predict the performance of the printed circuits and sensors, including the effects of bending and our proposed self-compensation thereto.

Methods: We used a human-centered design (HCD) approach to engage communities and community health volunteers (CHVs) in redesigning a proven data-centric supply chain approach that included a digital solution, called cStock, for this challenging context. We conducted the HCD process in 4 phases: (1) understanding intent, (2) research and insights, (3) ideation and prototyping, and (4) supply chain design and requirements building. Data collection used qualitative methods and involved a range of stakeholders including CHVs, supervisors, and local beneficiaries. CHVs and their supervisors also participated in cStock usability testing. Drawing on insights and personas generated from the research, stakeholders ideated and codesigned supply chain tools. Results: The research identified critical insights for informing the redesign of cStock for nomadic communities. These insights were categorized into supply chain, information systems, human resources, behaviors, service delivery infrastructure, and connectivity. Four supply chain data solutions were designed, prototyped, tested, and iterated: a stock recording paper-based form, a user-friendly cStock application, a supervisor cStock application, and an unstructured supplementary service data reporting system using feature phones. Conclusions: Using the HCD process incorporated the perspective of CHVs and their communities and provided key insights to inform the design of the supply chain and adapt cStock. The process helped make cStock to be inclusive and have the potential to have a meaningful impact on strengthening the supply chain for seminomadic and nomadic communities in northern Kenya.

Issues with U.S. and global markets for helium include inelastic demand, economic availability of helium only as a byproduct, only 4-5 major producers, helium's propensity to escape earth's crust, an ongoing absence of storage facilities comparable to the FHR, and a lack of consequences for the venting of helium. The complex combination of these economic, physical, and regulatory issues is unique to helium, and determining helium's practical availability goes far beyond estimating the technically accessible volume of underground resources. Although most of these issues have been analyzed since helium was recognized to be a valuable mineral commodity in the early 1900s, very few economic models have been developed that adequately consider the unique characteristics of helium and helium markets. In particular, there is a notable lack of recent empirical work to estimate the responsiveness of helium demand, supply, prices, and trade patterns to the ongoing drawdown and sale of helium reserves stored in the FHR. In general, existing models of helium either do not account for an oligopoly controlling supply, or they do not evaluate potential helium extraction and storage programs based on an intertemporal maximization of the value of the resource. Such models could be of very limited use to decision makers. This review found only one working paper with a helium market model that has incorporated both of these vital considerations. That and other economic studies along similar lines could be very useful in helping inform current helium policy discussions and decisions.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11053-017-9359-y,Web of Science

With increasing market uncertainties, stakeholder complexities, constraints of resources, companies nowadays are required to develop more context-specific solutions for mitigating sustainability risk and improving market performance in supply chain sustainability practices. To address the challenges faced by businesses, this study aims to explore how a company adapts green supply chain strategies for a competitive transformation. Specifically, we aim to identify different green supply chain capabilities that form hybrid choices of green solutions for a company to leverage an adaptive green shift. Through an extensive literature review, this study proposes a conceptual framework for exploration which is based on a qualitative in-depth case study in the electronics industry-one of the most polluting manufacturing sectors in China. The findings show that supply chain characteristics play a significant role in the selection of different green SCM solutions by businesses. We find different hybrid choices of strategic decisions are being made by the case company operating with high-volume and high-value supply chains respectively. High-volume supply chains adopt both operational pollution and waste control strategies and incremental green product strategies to balance cost of operational change and develop a competitive eco-efficient market expansion. In contrast, high-value supply chains adopt radical green product innovation strategies and operational waste prevention strategies to balance cost of product innovation and build operational efficiency to expand in a competitive eco-differentiation market.

The present paper is an attempt to review the developments in the realm of SCM over the past two decades. In the domain of SCM maturity, different models, dimensions (areas) and approaches are advanced for maturity measurements. Methods: Research studies conducted and presented in the literature, including papers on conference proceedings, articles in journals and technical reports, are reviewed; the review covers a time span from the early 1990s to the present time (2019). Also provided in this review are the previous models, dimensions (areas/ elements), and approaches for measuring SCM maturity techniques. Additionally, research gaps are identified, analysed and discussed. Results: After reviewing, the research studies in the field and the dimensions found in the works are placed into different categories. The current study aims to present a review of the literature, ultimately providing help to researchers in realizing gaps and opportunities in the field of SCM maturity. There are also different approaches to supply chain maturity models. For example, one approach may solely focus on integration while another might concentrate on SC visibility and traceability. In more recent research studies, more attention is paid to such specific areas of supply chain as flexibility and sustainability. The results of the present paper point to gaps, which indicate that more research works are required. In addition, it is assumed that the materials presented here may help establish more comprehensive SCM maturity models. Conclusions: It is seen that supply chain management is rapidly shifting toward e-SCM, and some other technologies like blockchain. Also, supply chain sustainability comes to the fore as a significant approach. It should be reminded that other strategic features of supply chains like leanness, agility, resilience, sustainability, integration, green and reverse logistics etc., also play their own role in the field. Combining these strategic features can be an effective idea for developing more comprehensive models for SCM maturity. To sum up, the results of the present survey indicate that the published works need more adequacy and treatment research, and that more research is called for to bridge the gaps in the realm of SCM maturity.",http://dx.doi.org/10.17270/J.LOG.2020.377,Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach - Through a single, embedded case design, a range of methods are used to collect data from companies representing three different supply chain tiers, including focal company, first-tier suppliers and first-tier customers. The collected data are analysed through the theoretical lens of interdependence. Findings - The findings indicate that the supply chain actors adapt information sharing to the pooled, serial or reciprocal type of interdependence. Information sharing is thus increased with key dyadic partners representing, for example, unique offerings and high market shares as percentage of total expenditure/sales. The study also unearths several barriers to information sharing beyond dyadic ties, including problems related to dis-aggregated, misinterpreted and/or incomplete information. Research limitations/implications - The study empirically contributes to the existing literature by exploring information sharing in the extended supply chain and by suggesting different approaches to information sharing depending on the type and intensity of interdependence between supply chain partners. Further, the paper contributes to the existing literature on barriers of information sharing in supply chains by identifying barriers specific to multi-tier information sharing. Meta-information (i.e. information about the shared information) is needed to overcome some of the barriers of sharing information in cases of weak, pooled interdependencies in the supply chain. Practical implications - Similar to previous empirical research, this exploratory study indicates that companies, in general, refrain from sharing information beyond dyadic ties. Supply chain managers would instead mostly focus on stronger, reciprocal interdependencies and emphasise dyadic information sharing. To further guide managers, a demand profiling framework considering market share and demand uncertainty is presented. It may be interesting to engage in multi-tier information sharing in particular cases where strong interdependence exists between three or more partners. Originality/value - This study contributes to existing research on information sharing in supply chains by empirically studying information sharing in an extended supply chain, applying interdependence theory as its analytical framework and unearthing several barriers that are specific to multi-tier information sharing.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SCM-07-2014-0252,Web of Science

Findings The proposed framework draws on the three DC classes of sensing, seizing and reconfiguring, and how they underscore logistics range and logistics response flexibility. The framework also distinguishes between DC classes and logistics flexibility that occur at operational, structural and strategic levels. DCs for the creation of logistics flexibility at a Swedish fast fashion retailer have also been identified and described as a means to further elaborate the characteristics of the DC classes. Research limitations/implications Current empirical data is limited to one specific company context. Practical implications The research presents a systematic and comprehensive map of different DCs that underscore logistics flexibility, a useful tool supporting logistics development efforts regarding flexibility. Originality/value The establishment of a more detailed DC lens, in which different classes of DCs are included, means that an improved understanding for how flexibility is created can be achieved. It helps the research to move beyond the here and now existence of logistics flexibility to instead focus on how logistics flexibility can be created.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJLM-07-2020-0266,Web of Science

It could be elaborated upon the decision variables such as price, quantity, and efforts. The member behaviors are operated and coordinated in the process of multiperiod dynamic game. Based on the multiperiod dynamic game theory, the service demand and price, quantity of goods, and efforts of members in the secondary service supply chain are considered. The paper discusses the reputation effect and ratchet effect in the multiperiod dynamic game service supply chain. Additionally, the paper describes this problem, builds a programming model based on the multiperiod dynamic game, and deduces the optimal solution. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the impact of reputation effect and ratchet effect on the agent's revenue. Through the simulation, it is found that the agency efforts are a combination result of reputation effect and ratchet effect in the process of multiperiod dynamic game. Through the long-term dynamic game, the short-term moral risk in service supply chain can be restrained so that the result under the asymmetric information is the same as that under the complete information.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/278094,Web of Science

One goal of such firms is to prolong the firm's survival in the market. At the supply networks (SN) level, the interactions among firms by means of engaging strategies, i.e., cooperation, defection, competition and co-opetition, are complexly interconnected and coevolved. Due to their complexity and dynamic nature, investigations of the outcomes of the coevolution of interconnected relationship strategies are non-trivial tasks. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes cellular automata simulation frameworks and adopts a complex adaptive supply networks perspective to develop a model of the coevolution of interconnected relationship strategies in a supply network. We aimed to determine how and under what conditions the survivability of firms inside supply networks is affected by the coevolution of interconnected relationship strategies among them. We constructed experiments using business environment scenarios of a SN as its factors and observed how different interaction policies of firms could produce networks effects that impact the lifespan of firms.

Three differential game models, considering the consumers preference, are established under three subsidy policies, and the corresponding optimal equilibrium strategies of the supply chain members are analyzed. An example is used to compare the effects of the three policies under the equal government subsidy expenditure. The study finds that the rankings of indexes to evaluate steady-state subsidy effects under the different subsidy policies are time invariant, and the government can preliminarily evaluate these policies according to different subsidy goals. The rankings of indexes to evaluate phased subsidy effects under these policies are time varying.

The closed forms of optimal solutions are obtained for companies to deal with the integrated problem of customer order decoupling point (CODP) decision and production-inventory plan simultaneously. Applications and numerical experiments are performed to illustrate practical insights for managers. The results show that the truth of zero-inventory policy is to avoid unnecessary inventory instead of absolutely no inventory. The CODP will shift forward with the increasing of customer demand rate and shift backward with the increasing of deterioration rate under the production smoothing policy. However, although it encounters the same changes of demand, the CODP moves with a smaller extent in high deterioration rate than in low.

In other words, Indian SMEs are highly likely to continue with business as usual - a customary of deficient modus of operandi, and refuse to search for optimal solutions and practices. We argue that overcoming satisficing biases may require Indian SMEs to strive for strategic flexibility that allow for prompt adjustments in value creation activities. A higher strategic flexibility allows SMEs in the manufacturing sector to rapidly adjust product range, variety, innovativeness, and speed of development to capitalize on new opportunities and minimize the negative impact of changing market condi-tions.

The results demonstrate that the characteristics of information sharing have different impacts on value, depending on the role played in the relationship.

We consider a model consisting of a manufacturer releasing a new product with uncertain release date and demand, and a retailer who must determine the allocation of limited capacity between a preexisting third-party product and the manufacturer's new product that may or may not be released on time. The manufacturer has a private forecast about the likelihood of the product release and/or about the demand, which he shares (either truthfully or not) with the retailer. We show that under the traditional supply chain structure (one-time opportunity to order) no truthful equilibrium can emerge. However, if (1) the supply chain structure allows for postponement, i.e., the ability to delay orders at a certain cost by the retailer, and (2) the manufacturer has informational uncertainty about the retailer's capacity, then truthful information exchange may emerge in equilibrium, where the manufacturer transmits his true forecast and the retailer treats the transmission as truthful. The genesis of this effect is preference reversal, where the manufacturer is not sure which way to distort the forecast to best motivate the retailer to wait for the new product.

However, to leverage big data and achieve supply chain innovation, a variety of complementary resources are necessary. In this study, we hypothesise that supply chain innovation (SCI) is dependent on firms' big data analytics capabilities (BAC). Furthermore, we propose that this relation is mediated by two crucial capabilities of agility and adaptability that enable firms to efficiently meet the challenges of supply chain ambidexterity. Finally, we also test the moderating role of technology uncertainty in our research model. We collected data from 386 manufacturing firms in Pakistan and tested our model using structural equation modelling. The results confirmed our initial hypotheses that agility and adaptability both mediated our baseline relationship of BAC and big data innovation in supply chains. We further found support for the moderating role of technology uncertainty. Furthermore, technology uncertainty moderates the relationship between BAC and SCI.
