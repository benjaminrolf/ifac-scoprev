Abstract = {Purpose This paper positions market sensing, supply chain agility and
   supply chain adaptability as a coherent cluster of dynamic supply chain
   capabilities. The purpose of this paper is to understand how dynamic
   supply chain capabilities interrelate and their effect on supply chain
   ambidexterity.
   Design/methodology/approach Based on a survey of Pakistani manufacturing
   firms, a theoretically-derived model was tested in a structural equation
   model.
   Findings The results of the study show that a market-sensing capability
   is an antecedent of supply chain agility and supply chain adaptability.
   Furthermore, supply chain agility, directly, and supply chain
   adaptability, indirectly, affect supply chain ambidexterity. Supply
   chain agility, therefore, mediates the relationship between supply chain
   adaptability and supply chain ambidexterity.
   Originality/value The contribution of this study lies in: first,
   identifying dynamic capability clusters relevant for achieving supply
   chain ambidexterity; second, evaluating performance implications of
   dynamic capabilities in the supply chain, specifically supply chain
   agility and adaptability; and third, proposing a unique measurement of
   supply chain ambidexterity in the light supply chain theory, and
   empirically evaluating the relationship between dynamic capabilities and
   supply chain ambidexterity.},

   Factories with Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Interest in smart factories and smart supply chains has been increasing,
   and researchers have emphasized the importance and the effects of
   advanced technologies such as 3D printers, the Internet of Things, and
   cloud services. This paper considers an innovation in dynamic
   supply-chain design and operations: connected smart factories that share
   interchangeable processes through a cloud-based system for personalized
   production. In the system, customers are able to upload a product design
   file, an optimal supply chain design and operations plan are then
   determined based on the available resources in the network of smart
   factories. The concept of smart supply chains is discussed and six types
   of flexibilities are identified, namely: design flexibility, product
   flexibility, process flexibility, supply chain flexibility,
   collaboration flexibility, and strategic flexibility. Focusing on supply
   chain flexibility, a general planning framework and various optimization
   models for dynamic supply chain design and operations plan are proposed.
   Further, numerical experiments are conducted to analyze fixed,
   production, and transportation costs for various scenarios. The results
   demonstrate the extent of the dynamic supply chain design and operations
   problem, and the large variation in transportation cost.},

Title = {Fits and misfits of supply chain flexibility to environmental
   uncertainty Two types of asymmetric effects on performance},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {862-885},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare the effects on
   performance of two types of misfits (overfit vs underfit) as well as two
   types of fits (high-high fit vs low-low fit) between environmental
   uncertainty and supply chain flexibility.
   Design/methodology/approach - The two asymmetry hypotheses have been
   tested with survey data from 212 Chinese manufacturing firms.
   Findings - The results in general provided empirical evidences for the
   asymmetric effects in the fits and misfits between environmental
   uncertainty and supply chain flexibility. For the same degree of misfit,
   underfit deteriorates performance more than overfit. In addition, high
   supply chain flexibility fitting high environmental uncertainty (i.e.
   high-high fit) results in a higher performance than low supply chain
   flexibility fitting low environmental uncertainty (i.e. low-low fit).
   Practical implications - It suggests that managers should strive to
   avoid the underfit of supply chain flexibility rather than the overfit,
   if the perfect fit is impossible to achieve. In addition, as it is
   beneficial to realize the fit of supply chain flexibility to high levels
   of environmental uncertainty, managers should probably embrace the
   highly uncertain environment and enhance the supply chain flexibility of
   their organizations to meet the increasing uncertainty of environment.
   Originality/value - Fit and misfit are the core concepts to understand
   the relationships among environmental uncertainty, supply chain
   flexibility strategy, and performance. While the existing literature
   highlights the differential performance consequences of fit vs misfit
   between environmental uncertainty and supply chain flexibility strategy,
   the effects on performance are assumed to be the same for the two types
   of misfits, and two types of fits. The authors challenge these symmetry
   assumptions by arguing that overfit has a less negative effect on
   performance than underfit, and high-high fit has a stronger positive
   effect than low-low fit. The authors found empirical evidence in a large
   sample of Chinese manufacturing firms.},

Abstract = {Purpose It is crucial to recognize that supply chain flexibility is
   important to build sustainable competitive edge in coping with
   uncertainty. This study puts forth an empirically supported integrative
   framework to understand supply chain flexibility from market-oriented
   and network-oriented perspectives, interrelationships among its
   dimensions and the effect of supply chain complexity as a contingent
   factor. Design/methodology/approach The online survey data were
   collected from 201 manufacturing companies and checked for common method
   variance, validity and reliability. Structural equation modeling was
   then used to test the hypotheses. Findings The results of this study
   demonstrate that there are interrelationships among market-oriented and
   network-oriented supply chain flexibility dimensions. It is the
   flexibility embedded in the supply chain network configuration that
   plays critical roles in superior performance in flexibility capabilities
   to create customer values. The interrelated effect among flexibility
   dimensions is contingent on the magnitude of the supply chain complexity
   corresponding to the number of supply chain tiers. Originality/value
   This study takes a step to advance understanding of supply chain
   flexibility from an integrative point of view consisting of
   market-oriented and network-oriented perspectives. This study is
   expected to provide practitioners the foundation to implement supply
   chain flexibility considering the interrelationships among flexibility
   dimensions. Our results suggest that to carry out a supply chain
   flexibility strategy, the vertical complexity of the supply chain
   structure needs to be taken into consideration.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},

Volume = {147},
Number = {B, SI},
Pages = {198-210},

Abstract = {Although a responsive supply chain is an integral part of order-winning
   manufacturing strategies, it has not been clear how firms build a
   responsive supply chain in global manufacturing environments. Built upon
   a synthesis of the existing literature and relevant theories, this paper
   presents a research model that defines the drivers, strategy, and
   practices of a responsive supply chain and the performance outcomes.
   This paper is one of the rare empirical studies that identify key
   variables relevant to the implementation of a successful responsive
   supply chain. The effective implementation of a responsive supply chain
   requires a careful definition of a responsive supply chain strategy in
   terms of the product range, and the frequency and innovativeness of the
   product offerings. Firms also need to provide key implementation
   practices (i.e., sharing of information with customers, collaboration
   with suppliers, use of advanced manufacturing technology) to achieve
   pull production to achieve responsiveness to the market. This study also
   suggests that the key contextual factors that influence the extent of
   implementation of a responsive supply chain strategy are mostly the size
   of firms, industry characteristics, and customer and supplier bases,
   rather than the location of manufacturing firms. This paper shows that
   the effective implementation of a responsive supply chain strategy
   involves the integration of inter-organizational resources (i.e.,
   socio-relational and techno-process integration) across the global
   supply chain to enhance pull production capabilities. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Pages = {964-1026},
Abstract = {Purpose - The conceptualization of flexibility in organizations
   historically emerged from three views which relate to economic, to
   organizational and to manufacturing perspectives. Despite the growing
   number of publications about supply chain flexibility in the area of
   supply chain management, there is a lack of consensus on how to define
   and to conceptualize supply chain flexibility from a management point of
   view. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview
   of the literature on the supply chain flexibility perspective and
   contributes to our understanding of the current state of research and
   its future development.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology used is the
   systematic literature review. In total 92 articles were selected from
   databases of well-known journal publishers in the field of economics,
   business studies and management sciences as well as grey literature to
   cover the topic of supply chain flexibility.
   Findings - A limited number of studies in the field of supply chain
   flexibility apply theories and define the term supply chain flexibility.
   Instead they focus on a particular part or dimension of the supply
   chain. Based on the analysis, a distinction is made between flexibility
   in the supply chain and supply chain flexibility. Based on the function
   and characteristics of the supply chain, the authors selected 30
   flexibility dimensions that cover supply chain flexibility by
   concentrating on the different business areas involved.
   Research limitations/implications - The results support researchers and
   practitioners by identifying relevant trends and gaps in the field of
   supply chain flexibility.
   Originality/value - The authors review the dimensions and aspects of
   supply chain flexibility that are currently taken into account in the
   literature. In this way, the authors provide an overarching perspective
   on the flexibility literature relating to supply chains.},

   Design/Methodology/Approach: The study used an online survey for data

   responsiveness capability are significantly and positively associated
   with operational performance. However, the results show that integration
   capability has no significant impact on operational performance
   Conclusion: The study concludes that in a dynamic environment,
   developing supply chain dynamic capabilities can help manufacturing
   company managers to build effective supply chains and achieve superior
   performance. Further, managers need to recognize that supply chain

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role
   of process simplification on the relationship between process
   integration and upstream supply chain flexibility in Indian automotive
   organizations.
   Design/methodology/approach The three-step mediation analysis was
   performed using SPSS macro PROCESS to assess the mediating role of
   process simplification on the relationship between process integration
   constructs: top management commitment and supplier relationship; and
   upstream supply chain flexibility.
   Findings The results indicate a complete mediation effect of process

   flexibility, while partial mediation effect is noticed between top
   management commitment and upstream supply chain flexibility.
   Practical implications For Indian automotive managers, the study
   suggests that for improving the upstream supply chain flexibility,
   organizations must have a strategy towards improving the simplification
   of supply chain processes by upgrading technology and providing training
   to their suppliers. This understanding will help the automotive managers
   to simplify their upstream supply chain processes for gaining

   is a powerful way to improve the efficiency and quality of supply chain
   operation by evaluating the level of supply chain flexibility
   effectively. The traditional method is used to decompose the supply
   chain flexibility evaluation indicators from the perspective of system
   structure or cost saving, but these indicators cannot truly describe the
   dynamics of the supply chain operation. Otherwise, supply chain
   flexibility evaluation is a typical multiobjective evaluation; there are
   some incompatibilities between these flexible evaluation indicators, and
   the common evaluation methods are difficult to deal with such
   contradictions. In this paper, the dynamic characteristics of supply
   chain operation are considered, and the evaluation system of supply
   chain flexibility is designed from the perspective of operation
   efficiency. The matter-element analysis theory is used to create the
   comprehensive appraisal model of supply chain flexibility. The
   matter-element matrix solves the uncertainty and incompatibility of the
   evaluated factors used to assess supply chain flexibility. The paper
   evaluates the performance of four autoservice companies and concludes
   that the evaluation grades of the four companies are in line with the
   reality, indicating that the evaluation system and the method are
   effective and credible.},

Title = {New metrics for measuring supply chain reconfigurability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING},
Abstract = {The COVID 19 pandemic, fluctuating demand, market uncertainty and the
   emergence of new technologies explain the need for a more flexible and
   agile supply chain. In fact, several important factors should be taken
   into account in the process of building an adaptive and reconfigurable
   supply chain. Reconfigurability is used to measure quantitatively the
   capability of supply chain to change easily their structure and
   functions. The aim of this work is to evaluate the level of
   reconfigurability of a supply chain. Quantitative measures of six
   indicators that characterize reconfigurability are presented in this
   paper. Then, an index of reconfigurability in supply chain is developed
   based on The Multi-Attribute Utility Theory in order to choose the most
   reconfigurable configuration. An illustrative example is also given.
   From the discussion, it is deduced that the characteristics of the
   reconfigurable supply chain impacts positively on the degree of
   reconfigurability.},

Abstract = {Supply chain flexibility has become an important ingredient to remain
   competitive in today's increasingly complex business environment. Within
   this context, drawing from the knowledge-based view of the firm, we
   investigate the influence of internal and external knowledge transfer
   activities on supply chain flexibility. In addition, taking a
   contingency perspective, we hypothesize about the moderating effects of
   product and supply complexity on the relationships between knowledge
   transfer and supply chain flexibility. We test our hypotheses with data
   collected from procurement and supply chain professionals in Germany.
   Pursuant to our expectations, we find a positive and significant
   influence of internal and external knowledge transfer on supply chain
   flexibility. We further confirm a negative moderating effect of supply
   complexity on the relationship between internal knowledge transfer and
   supply chain flexibility, and a negative moderating effect of product
   complexity on the relationship between external knowledge transfer and
   supply chain flexibility. However, contrary to our expectations, we find
   significant positive effects for the remaining two moderations, being
   indicative of the unique dynamics emanating from complexity, able to
   yield both negative and positive moderation effects contingent on the
   situation. Overall, these findings provide important insight into the
   value of knowledge transfer activities for supply chain flexibility, and
   especially into when knowledge transfer is most effective, drawing
   attention to influential complexity contingencies. Theoretical and
   practical contributions are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {The role of capabilities in shaping sustainable supply chain flexibility
   and enhancing circular economy-target performance: an empirical study},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Abstract = {Purpose A circular economy is a popular approach considered by many
   firms to address sustainable development goals strategically. Literature
   indicates that collaborative relationships among supply chain partners
   facilitate circular economy practices. However, there is a dearth of
   studies in lower-middle-income countries indicating the unique
   challenges industries face whilst practising circular economy principles
   and how the challenges can be overcome. To address the calls of previous
   researchers, this study aims to explore the following relationships:
   engagement and alliance capability whilst data analytics capability
   plays a mediating role; the relationship between alliance and data
   analytics capability with sustainable supply chain flexibility whilst
   industry dynamism is considered as a moderating variable and the
   relationship between sustainable supply chain flexibility and circular
   economy-target performance. Design/methodology/approach A
   cross-sectional survey was performed and data was collected from 760
   employees of Indian firms. Covariance-based structural equation
   modelling was applied to perform the path analysis to determine a firm's
   capabilities in shaping sustainable supply chain flexibility and
   enhancing circular economy target performance. Findings Drawing upon
   dynamic capability theory, it was first established that engagement
   capability has a positive and significant influence on alliance
   capability, whilst data analytics capability played a partial mediating
   role. Second, it was established that alliance capability and data
   analytics capability significantly affect sustainable supply chain
   flexibility, whilst industry dynamism played a moderating role. Finally,
   it was clear that sustainable supply chain flexibility had a significant
   and positive effect on circular economy target performance, ultimately
   enhancing sustainability. Originality/value This study advances the
   circular economy literature by recommending that firms must consider
   some critical operational level capabilities to develop their dynamic
   capability, i.e. sustainable supply chain flexibility, to better meet
   the competitive market conditions in turbulent business environments.},

   industry},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {228},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework for
   analyzing the relationships among Additive Manufacturing adoption,
   flexibility, and performance in the supply chain context. No empirical
   study was found in the supply chain literature that specifically
   examines the relationships among Additive Manufacturing adoption,
   flexibility and performance; the paper therefore fills an important gap
   in the supply chain literature. The research is based on a quantitative
   approach using a questionnaire survey from a total of 124 medium-and
   large-sized European Union automotive manufacturing companies. The
   hypothesized relationships are tested using partial least square
   structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The research provides insights
   into how supply chain flexibility mediates the effect of Additive
   Manufacturing adoption on supply chain performance in the context of
   European automotive industry. Research findings indicate that Additive
   Manufacturing adoption positively impacts supply chain flexibility and
   that, in turn, supply chain flexibility positively impacts supply chain
   performance. This suggests that companies should focus on flexibilities
   in the supply chain to improve its performance. Overall, these findings
   provide important insights into the value of Additive Manufacturing

   the most scientific attention between 1996 and 2005. However, the
   majority of the currently valid types and dimensions of flexibility have
   been defined in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The current paper
   provides the leading academic journals and papers in the field of
   flexibility research. Additionally, the results of our citation analysis

Abstract = {The strategic dynamic supply chain reconfiguration (DSCR) problem is to
   prescribe the location and capacity of each facility, select links used
   for transportation, and plan material flows through the supply chain,

   objective is to minimize total cost. The network must be dynamically

   their capacities, and closing facilities) over time to accommodate
   changing trends in demand and/or costs. The problem involves a

   objectives of this paper are a traditional formulation and a
   network-based model of the DSCR problem; tests to promote intuitive

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how the consistency

Abstract = {Factory in a box (FiB) is an emerging technology that meets the dynamic
   and diverse market demand by carrying a factory module on vehicles to
   perform on-site production near customers' locations. It is suitable for
   meeting time-sensitive demands, such as the outbreak of disasters or
   epidemics/pandemics. Compared to traditional manufacturing, FiB poses a
   new challenge of frequently reconfiguring supply chain networks since
   the final production location changes as the vehicle carrying the
   factory travels. Supply chain network reconfiguration involves decisions
   regarding whether suppliers or manufacturers can be retained in the
   supply chain or replaced. Such a supply chain reconfiguration problem is
   coupled with manufacturing process planning, which assigns tasks to each
   manufacturer that impacts material flow in the supply chain network.
   Considering the supply chain reconfigurability, this article develops a
   new mathematical model based on nonlinear integer programming to
   optimize supply chain reconfiguration and assembly planning jointly. An
   evolutionary algorithm (EA) is developed and customized to the joint
   optimization of process planning and supplier/manufacturer selection.
   The performance of EA is verified with a nonlinear solver for a relaxed
   version of the problem. A case study on producing a medical product
   demonstrates the methodology in guiding supply chain reconfiguration and
   process planning as the final production site relocates in response to
   local demands. The methodology can be potentially generalized to supply
   chain and service process planning for a mobile hospital offering
   on-site medical services.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a sudden change from normal
   conditions to disruption conditions, and industrial sectors have
   experienced eroded growth. In particular, the manufacturing industry
   experienced a slowdown due to the sudden disruption in supply and
   demand. This situation stimulates the manufacturing industry to recover
   from this current challenging disruption. This study investigates the
   impact of supply chain integration on business performance through
   supply chain resilience, supply chain flexibility, and innovation system
   in Indonesia's manufacturing companies. Data collection has obtained as
   many as 470 questionnaires considered valid for further analysis. Data
   analysis used the partial least square (PLS) technique using smartPLS
   software version 3.0. The results show that supply chain integration
   affects innovation system, supply chain flexibility, and supply chain
   resilience because of its ability to share complete product information
   and share production planning. Innovation systems and supply chain
   flexibility enhance supply chain resilience through the ability to deal
   with sudden changes in customer demand and production problems. Supply

Abstract = {Supply chain flexibility is the processing ability of the enterprize to
   deal with the uncertain environment of supply and demand. In this paper,
   we consider the supply side (node interrupt) and demand side (demand
   fluctuations) under uncertain environment. By using the deep belief
   network (DBN), which is composed of multilayer Restricted Boltzmann
   Machine (RBM), it establishes the supply chain flexibility network with
   optimization of the transfer node and flow. The deep belief network is
   trained by the data of large manufacturing enterprize, compared with the
   traditional neural network (MLR, BP and GA). The results show that the
   deep belief network model overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional
   neural networks, such as easy to fall into local optimum, long training
   time and low function fitting degree, and it has higher prediction
   accuracy. This network model based on the deep belief network can
   promote the supply chain flexibility more, when supply and demand
   fluctuations occur.},

Abstract = {Supply chain flexibility is increasingly important for gaining and
   maintaining a decisive competitive edge. Companies still remain in need
   of a powerful approach that allows an ongoing and feasible evaluation of
   supply chain flexibility to develop this ability in a targeted way. The
   key findings of our paper can be summarized to the extent that we
   introduce a new approach to methodically assess a supply chain's
   flexibility based on appropriate key figures. Additionally, we further
   proof the functional capability of our newly developed evaluation
   approach. This evaluation is performed by investigating the process
   chain along the dyadic supplier-buyer relationships in terms of order
   lead time and cost deviations related to order-processing. Thus, a
   modified bivariate unilateral process capability analysis will be
   applied to calculate process capability measures of these supply chain
   processes. The capability measures indicate whether the supply chain
   processes investigated are capable of managing changing conditions in a
   timely and cost-efficient manner. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to quantify the supply chain flexibility
   for an Indian soap manufacturing firm and to measure its performance.
   The authors made an attempt to find key strategic and operational
   decision-making dimensions for developing effective supply chain
   flexibility environment.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors have extracted 11 supply chain flexibility dimensions
   through extensive literature review. The authors used a decision-making
   trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) to make causal analysis and
   prioritizing the dimensions. After DEMATEL analysis three major supply
   chain flexibility dimensions that seem to have significant amount of
   influence on supply chain performance of the firms were retained for
   further consideration. The authors have developed an excel-based
   template for quantitative assessment of flexibility performance
   indicators.
   Findings
   This study provides key enablers for the successful implementation of
   flexibility concepts in Indian soap manufacturing firms and gives a view
   how to measure the performance through designing template based on real
   data. This template can be used in other firms also by simply modifying
   the key attributes.
   Originality/value
   A flexibility index has been defined here with the purpose of assessing
   the level of flexibility vis-a-vis what is desired and is meant to be
   evaluated from time to time, to assess if the firm is improving its
   flexibility or not. The index assumes importance in view of the fact
   that it has been prepared based on feedbacks of both the upper and the
   lower management people of the firm engaged in policymaking and
   operations.},

Abstract = {In the face of an external environment featuring a high level of risk,
   multiple changes, and high uncertainty, the supply chain's emergency
   replenishment, collaborative management, regulation of organic
   commodity, and low-cost rapid response will promote its' sustainable
   growth and development, which is necessary for today's economic
   development. The digitization and flexibility of the supply chain are of
   great value in obtaining the sustainable development of the supply
   chain. When dealing with an uncertain environment and market risk,
   current supply chain flexibility not only functions through its internal
   organizational flexibility, but also through collaborative creation and
   an extended supply chain network which will proactively form a
   replenishment supply sub-chain driven by the need for change
   responsiveness. This article constructs an associated model consisting
   of digitization, supply chain flexibility, and sustainability using an
   empirical analysis method to explore the implicit correlation of these
   factors. The analysis results of the mediating effect model show that
   both digitization and flexibility have significant positive effects on
   the sustainable development of the supply chain. Collaborative knowledge
   creation and supply chain flexibility play multiple mediating roles
   while market uncertainty positively moderates the impact of supply chain
   flexibility on supply chain sustainable development.},

Title = {An integration of environmental awareness into flexible supply chains: a
   trade-off between costs and environmental pollution},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Today, environmental awareness is highly interested in supply chains and
   logistics networks with regard to sustainable development goals. This
   proposes a bi-objective linear mathematical model comprising supply
   chain flexibility dimensions. The proposed model is to integrate
   environmental considerations into a flexible supply chain as an
   optimization framework. The first objective function is to minimize the
   costs, while the second one minimizes the environmental impacts of
   automotive industry. The goal of this paper is to find a trade-off
   between the total cost and the environmental pollution with regard to
   the supply chain flexibility dimensions. We suggest adding four
   different supply chain flexibility dimensions to the model which are
   budget for transportation, trained labor team to help the packaging
   process, number of active plants, and outsourcing the painting process
   flexibilities to curb harmful emissions from factories while reducing
   the costs. Six flexibility scenarios are proposed in this study to do
   the sensitivity analysis. The model is applicable with the use of a real
   data set derived from an automotive parts factory located in Iran. We
   use an improved augmented epsilon-constraint method to address the
   proposed bi-objective optimization framework. The results show that
   choosing the model with all flexibility dimensions is the best
   initiative to promote sustainable development, since it leads to a
   significant reduction in costs and environmental pollution.},

   located in emerging economies, even more face to the post-pandemic
   scenario. The methodology used to analyze the theoretical constructs
   related to the study was PRISMA declaration. It was applied using
   several databases (Scopus and Web of Science) and specific search
   equations investigating several lenses related to supply chain dynamic
   capabilities (SCDC) as an adjuvant to create and promote horizontal
   collaborative networks (HCN). It mitigates the risks through
   collaborative processes between actors in the supply chain, developing
   resilience. The lenses considered are dynamic capabilities view, supply
   chain resilience and collaborative networks. The study results reveal
   that collaborative networks could support the risk management in supply
   chains that develop this practice. In the same way, supply chain dynamic
   capabilities (SCDC) can be considered as a relevant factor in
   stimulating integration between different and exogenous actors of the
   supply chain in a horizontal collaboration, and also considering the
   collaboration as one of the most important supply chain dynamic
   capability (SCDC) to be developed for SME's as a good way to dynamize
   their supply chains, avoid the risk and as a good practice to improve
   the corporate sustainability in emerging markets.},

Abstract = {Supply chain flexibility is an important operations strategy dimension
   for organizations to achieve and maintain competitive advantage. With

   organizations function in this complex and uncertain environment, yet
   investigation into this area is very limited. This paper aims contribute
   to this field by investigating green supply chain flexibility
   achievement through information systems. This paper introduces a green
   supply chain flexibility matrix framework. Given the large data needs,
   as described in the matrix, a novel probability evaluation methodology
   that can help predict rankings of projects and programs is introduced.
   The methodology extends a TOPSIS based three-parameter interval grey
   number (TpGN) approach by incorporating neighborhood rough set theory
   (RST) to evaluate IS programs' green flexibility support capability. The
   results of this methodology are more objective and effective for two
   reasons. (1) The results are predictive rankings based on probability
   degree instead of the fixed deterministic ranks. (2) Neighborhood rough
   set theory used in this study can limit loss of information when
   compared to rough set theory, yet still simplify extensive data sets.

Abstract = {Empirical studies about supply chain flexibility have mainly focused on
   one (manufacturing) company, occasionally incorporating the adjoining
   view from a supplier, distributor, or retailer. The present paper argues
   that a dyadic perspective is not sufficient and that an integrated
   perspective is required. In-depth case study data was collected and
   analyzed. The data covers eight organizations in a fast-moving consumer
   goods (FMCG) food supply chain, including suppliers, the main
   manufacturer, the logistics service provider, and retailers. Drawing on
   network theory and stakeholder theory, the study analyzed how these
   eight organizations experience flexibility across the supply chain. The
   findings show that each chain member implements flexibility to fulfill
   the direct needs of the next-tier chain member. Organizations at
   different positions in the supply chain prioritize other flexibilities.

Abstract = {This paper aims to understand the underlying mechanisms by which
   relational ties influence firm innovation. Companies in China rely much
   on relational ties to implement business strategies. Combining social
   network theory with dynamic capability perspective, we build a model
   that analyzes the direct and indirect impact of relational ties
   (business ties and service ties) on innovation performance through
   supply chain adaptability. We further analyze that technological
   turbulence and dysfunctional competition influence the relationships
   between relational ties and supply chain adaptability. We test these
   relationships using data collected from 300 manufacturers in China. The
   results show that service ties plays a relatively more important role
   than business ties in enhancing innovation performance directly.
   Interactions between business ties and service ties significantly
   influence innovation performance. Moreover, our results demonstrate that
   supply chain adaptability fully mediates the relationship between
   business ties and innovation performance but partially mediates the
   relationship between service ties and innovation performance. Our
   results show that technological turbulence positively moderates the
   relationships between business/service ties and supply chain
   adaptability. In addition, dysfunctional competition negatively
   moderates the relationship between business ties and supply chain
   adaptability. Overall, our findings contribute to the understanding of
   the roles of relational ties in supply chain.},

Title = {Modelling Supply Chain Flexibility in the Indian Personal Hygiene
   Industry: An ISM-Fuzzy MICMAC Approach},
Journal = {GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW},
Abstract = {With the changing business environment, firms are adopting flexible
   systems across their supply chains as a survival as well as a growth
   strategy. The aim of the article is to identity the key enablers of
   supply chain flexibility (SCF) adoption and to evaluate their fitness in
   the context of the personal hygiene industry in India. After a
   systematic literature review, 22 key dimensions of SCF have been
   extracted. A field investigation through interviews and a brainstorming
   session with industry experts have resulted in 11 dimensions, finally.
   Twenty-six experts participated in this interview and brainstorming
   session. These 11 dimensions have been exposed to interpretive
   structural modelling (ISM) to assess the hierarchal interaction among
   them. Fuzzy MICMAC has been employed to identify the driving dimensions
   of supply chain flexibility for the personal hygiene industry. The
   findings suggest that seven dimensions, namely process, manufacturing,
   sourcing, volume, market, new product development and coordination, have
   high dependence but weak driving power and are thus dependent on the
   other dimensions to influence the supply chain flexibility. Demand
   management and product flexibilities were found to have the strongest
   driving force and act as the key drivers for SCF. The originality of the
   conducted study lies in the multilevel hierarchical structure.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Purpose
   As the event industry is supported by a wide range of suppliers that
   provide different products and services, all these partners in the
   supply chain can play a crucial role in green practices. The industry
   needs to have a sufficient degree of supply chain flexibility to cater
   to the demands in today's dynamic environment and the flexibility in the
   supply chain will help event businesses to be sustainable. This study
   aims to explore the role of the supply chain flexibility fit between
   event planner's requirements and supplier offerings on the
   implementation of green practices. The study also attempted to provide
   insights into the adoption of green event practices by identifying the
   moderating roles of green organization image and public pressure.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Data analysis was conducted based on 207 useable responses from event
   planners. Polynomial regression and response surface analysis were
   performed to verify the hypothesized relationships. Additionally,
   hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the moderating effects
   of green organization image and public pressure on the proposed
   relationships.
   Findings
   Results revealed that product flexibility fit was positively related to
   green practices; however, such effect was not found in the volume
   flexibility fit model. Findings also showed that public pressure
   significantly improved the positive effect of product flexibility fit on
   green practices. However, the green organization image was found to have
   no significant moderating effect.
   Practical implications
   The adoption of green practices requires well-designed collaboration
   among supply chain partners. This study offers empirical evidence
   regarding the importance of achieving product flexibility fit between
   event planners' requirements and supplier offerings when conducting
   green practices. The findings provide useful implications that can be
   applied for successful green event management.
   Originality/value
   Despite the significance and relevance of the topic, barely any study
   has been conducted to assess supply chain flexibility and its
   relationship with green event practices. The study adopted resource
   orchestration theory to examine the role of supply chain flexibility on
   green event practices by focusing on the planner-supplier flexibility
   fit. A number of implications regarding supply chain management and
   future research are identified.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PURCHASING AND SUPPLY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Supply chain flexibility (SCF) has become an important competitive
   weapon for companies in the current dynamic environment. This paper
   explores the influence of ambidexterity on supply chain flexibility
   (SCF) and theorizes the moderating effect of information technology (IT)
   competence on that relationship. Whereas prior research focuses on the
   positive results of SCF for business performance, little empirical
   research has studied its facilitators, leaving the gap this study seeks
   to fill. We draw on resource orchestration theory to develop our
   research model. According to this theory, a firm can exploit the full
   potential of its resources and capabilities only when these are deployed
   in a complementary manner. This study proposes that ambidexterity
   impacts SCF positively and that its effect is amplified when the firm
   possesses IT competence. In order to test our hypotheses we have
   employed a hierarchical regression methodology and put into service data
   collected from manufacturing enterprises. The study confirms that
   ambidexterity, as the ability to explore and exploit SC resources,
   enables their orchestration, making SC resources flexible, and a high IT
   competence facilitates that orchestration.},

Abstract = {Supply chains are gradually transforming into more global structures. To
   ensure sustainability and resilience in face of the problems that arise
   in globalizing supply chains, it is becoming an important issue today; a
   supply chain must be flexible, agile and responsive. Therefore, the aim
   of the study is to focus on resilience in sustainable global supply
   chains (GSC) to avoid disruptions caused by pandemics such as COVID-19;
   it is also conducted research on responsiveness of sustainable global
   supply chains during COVID-19. In this study, dynamic capability
   perspective and contingency theory are used to conceptualize theoretical
   models for COVID-19. Moreover, a partial least squares (PLS) model is
   used to analyse the research hypotheses with 200 responses collected
   from companies which have complex supply chain structures. As a novel
   result, the relationship between flexibility, agility and responsiveness
   of global supply chain is revealed. Supply chain agility is found to be
   directly affected by supply chain flexibility. Moreover, supply chain
   flexibility and supply chain agility directly affect the responsiveness
   of the global supply chain. In addition, the agility of the supply chain
   acts as a partial mediator variable in the effect of supply chain
   flexibility on responsiveness.},

   Aim: This article tested the relationship between supply chain risks,
   flexibility and performance in the South African public sector.
   Method: A survey questionnaire was administered to 307 supply chain
   practitioners who were based in the public sector in Gauteng. A
   structural equation modelling procedure was utilised in testing the
   proposed relationships.
   Results: The results of the study showed that six supply chain risk
   factors, namely government policies, supply complexity, availability of
   skills, supplier performance monitoring, information security and
   process efficiency exert significant influences on supply chain
   flexibility. In turn, supply chain flexibility exerts a positive
   influence on the performance of the public supply chain.
   Conclusion: Managers in government may be able to improve the public
   supply chain management function through the suitable management of the
   supply chain risk factors considered in this study.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how blockchain
   technology can improve supply chain adaptability, alignment and agility
   which collectively enhance competitive advantage which in turn
   influences firm performance. Design/methodology/approach The conceptual
   framework of the present study is developed by conducting an extensive
   literature review on blockchain technology, supply chain adaptability,
   alignment, agility and competitive advantage. The sample data were
   collected from 397 supply chain practitioners in India to validate the
   conceptual model. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to
   ascertain the validity of the measures used and a structural model was
   analyzed for testing the proposed conceptual framework. Findings The
   results of the present study show that blockchain technology can improve
   supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility which lead to competitive
   advantage, which leads to better firm performance. Besides, trust
   generated through blockchain use also increases firm performance.
   Research limitations/implications - Currently, the respondents do not
   have practical experience of using blockchain technology. They have
   responded based on their knowledge about supply chain and blockchain
   which they acquired from published sources. Different supply chains
   require different strategic choices and different information needs. But
   the present study assumes that all supply chain needs are identical. The
   present study assumes that government regulations regarding blockchain
   technology are favorable; however, currently, there is no legal
   framework to address blockchain technology. The findings of the current
   study indicate that companies not only should create more awareness
   regarding blockchain but also should actively work with IT companies
   that are engaged in developing blockchain-based supply chain solution.
   Managers, as well as IT companies and academicians, should join hands to
   study and develop a framework for regulating blockchain technology and
   suggest these to the policy actors. Practical implications The present
   study shows that supply chain practitioners are confident that
   blockchain technology will help improve supply chain parameters. These
   findings can help IT companies and their marketers for developing and
   promoting blockchain-based IT applications. In addition, the important
   implication for supply chain practitioners is that blockchain helps in
   creating a competitive advantage and increases firm performance.
   Originality/value The effect of IT on important supply chain variables
   has been studied in the past; however, there is not a single study which
   sheds light on how disruptive technologies such as blockchain will
   affect supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility and firm
   performance.},

Abstract = {In today's market, sales promotional schemes have spun out to be
   essential for promoting outfits. Nonetheless, due to the sudden ascent
   in sales, the subsequent demand uncertainty calls for the high
   flexibility in supply chains. The present work examines the barriers to
   flexibility in the Indian automobile supply chains under such an
   environment from a sustainability viewpoint, an indispensable element of
   the present-day supply chains. In view of the literature and the
   descriptive survey led, 20 barriers have been identified. Through the
   analytical investigation directed, a numerical index value for the
   sustainable supply chain flexibility barriers is developed via
   graph-theoretical and matrix approach. Findings, along with the
   sensitivity analysis, conducted establish that the barriers at the
   supply chain's procurement function have the highest impact in
   inhibiting the sustainable supply chain flexibility, thus significantly
   affecting the firm performance during sales promotional schemes. The
   obtained barrier index can be utilised for assessing the performance of
   all the companies across the industry. The model proposed offers
   valuable discernments to practicing officials in focusing on the
   significant barriers. This study augments the existing literature by
   linking the supply chain flexibility, Sustainability, and Sales

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to assess supply chain reconfigurability in
   a global scenario. The paper attempts to measure comprehensive relative

   assessment methodology that utilizes both the Delphi technique and the
   additive weighting method to calculate RRI. The uniqueness of the
   present research is to quantify reconfigurability in the case supply
   chain by a numerical index termed as CRRI. The paper analyzes the level
   of reconfigurability competence of the case supply chain in comparison
   with an ideal supply chain and thus facilitates structural flexibility.
   The proposed model for calculating CRRI, using two methodologies and
   comparing the results, is an innovative way of measuring supply chain
   reconfigurability. Supply chain's preparedness to structurally change in
   the present business environment of uncertainty and turbulence can be
   evaluated and it would act as an aide in decision making pertaining to
   reconfigurability in supply chains.},

Abstract = {The optimal coordination strategy is achieved when the dynamic supply
   chain profit is maximized. The profit of dynamical supply chain is
   decided by the corresponding effort level of each node enterprise. This
   paper presents a cooperative stochastic differential game model to
   research the optimal coordination strategy of a dynamic supply chain
   under uncertain conditions and studies how to coordinate the effort
   level of node enterprise to maximize supply chain profit. For this
   purpose, a cooperative stochastic differential game model of the
   enterprises' effort level is constructed, and the optimal solution of
   the model is solved by converting it to the solution of the equivalent
   stochastic partial differential equation. As a result, the optimal
   strategy of a local node enterprise is achieved. Considering the gap
   between the independent decision of each node enterprise and the optimal
   decision of the supply chain system, the coordination mechanisms of the
   dynamic supply chain, including the temporary static allocation
   mechanism and the compensation mechanism, are given to narrow the gap to
   achieve the optimal coordination strategy under uncertain conditions.

Title = {A new approach for business process reconfiguration under uncertainty
   using Dempster-Shafer Theory},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE-OPERATIONS \& LOGISTICS},
Abstract = {In an increasingly changing and uncertain market, adapting the supply
   chain to new changes requires reconfiguring supply chains processes to
   improve its performance. The decision-making process for the
   reconfiguration of supply chains must take into consideration the
   uncertainty and imprecision related to the judgments of the
   decision-makers. This paper deals with uncertainty in the
   decision-making process of supply chain reconfiguration using the
   Dempster-Shafer theory. An approach to reconfigure supply chain business
   processes under uncertainty is also proposed to improve the
   decision-making process for supply chain reconfiguration. The
   reconfiguration of the supply chain involves selecting the most
   appropriate configuration, process, actor and role that should be
   reconfigured in advance in order to optimise the reconfiguration using
   the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process
   (AHP) method. To reduce the imprecision and uncertainty related to the
   judgments and preferences of the decision-makers, the Dempster-Shafer
   theory is applied and, to validate the introduced approach, a case study
   is conducted.},

Title = {Are internal manufacturing and external supply chain flexibilities
   complementary capabilities?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {30},
Number = {3},
Pages = {180-200},

Abstract = {Manufacturing flexibility is often viewed as a strategic capability that
   enables firms to more effectively meet heterogeneous market demands
   arising, in part, from increased product proliferation. However, recent
   studies suggest that the operational challenges associated with meeting
   this objective may be heavily dependent not only upon a firm's internal
   modification, mix, and new product flexibilities, but also upon the
   flexibility of its inbound and outbound supply chain partners. Drawing
   upon the theory of Complementarity, we examine if simultaneous
   utilization of both internal and external flexibilities does in fact
   create synergies that can improve a firm's delivery performance. Based
   on a sample of 158 U.S. manufacturing plants, we find that the extent to
   which performance enhancing synergies are generated is primarily
   dependent upon the type of internal flexibility that is paired with
   supply chain flexibilities. Additionally, we find that when synergies do
   exist, external supplier and logistics flexibilities generally tend to
   enhance the scope of flexible response, while internal flexibilities
   generally tend to enhance the achievability of a flexible response.
   Taken together, our findings suggest that the ability of firms to
   actually reap the synergistic benefits of an integrated system of supply
   chain flexibility is much more complex and nuanced than previously
   believed or expected. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {How does intellectual capital affect product innovation performance?
   Evidence from China and India},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS \& PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {895-914},
Abstract = {Purpose Intellectual capital reflects the sum of existing knowledge a
   manufacturer is able to leverage and plays a critical role in new
   product development. The purpose of this paper is to empirically
   investigate the mechanisms through which intellectual capital enhances
   product innovation performance and how economic and institutional
   environments affect the mechanisms.
   Design/methodology/approach Using a knowledge-based view and
   institutional theory, this study proposes a model on the relationships
   among intellectual capital, supplier knowledge integration, supply chain
   adaptability, and product innovation performance. The hypotheses are
   empirically tested using multiple group structural equation modelling
   and data collected from 300 Chinese and 200 Indian manufacturers.
   Findings The authors find that intellectual capital improves product
   innovation performance both directly and indirectly through supplier
   knowledge integration. However, the effects are different in China and
   India. In particular, the direct effect of intellectual capital on
   product innovation performance is significantly higher in China than
   that in India, and intellectual capital improves product innovation
   performance indirectly through supplier knowledge integration only in
   India. The authors also find that supplier knowledge integration
   improves product innovation performance indirectly through supply chain
   adaptability in both China and India.
   Originality/value Using a moderated mediation model, this study provides
   insights into the joint effects of intellectual capital, supplier
   knowledge integration, and supply chain adaptability on product
   innovation performance. The findings enhance current understandings of
   how supply chain management helps a manufacturer develop new products
   using existing knowledge and the influences of economic and
   institutional environments on knowledge and supply chain management.},

   Network},
Journal = {COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2018},
Abstract = {Supply chain network is more complex and dynamic under the uncertain
   demand and the lead time. Robustness is a key index of the stable
   operation for the supply chain network. We investigate a fuzzy robust
   strategy to realize the robust operation of the supply chain network
   with the production lead times and the ordering lead times under the
   uncertain customer demand. A discrete switched model of the dynamic
   supply chain network with the lead times and the uncertain customer
   demand is established based on T-S fuzzy systems. Then a fuzzy switched
   strategy is proposed to control the switching actions among subsystems.
   Furthermore, by introducing the inhibition rate.., a fuzzy control
   strategy for the dynamic supply chain network is put forward to suppress
   the impacts of the lead times and the uncertain customer demand on the
   operation of the dynamic supply chain network. The fuzzy robust strategy
   composed of the fuzzy switched strategy and the fuzzy control strategy
   can guarantee the robust operation of the supply chain network at low
   cost. Finally, the simulation researches show the advantage of the
   proposed fuzzy robust strategy through the comparisons with the common

Abstract = {This study considers supply chain network configuration in an innovative
   environment while the new product development (NPD) will affect the
   supply chain configuration (SCC). The time of new product introduction
   has a significant effect on the market performance while it has an
   effect on the supply chain configuration. Supplier integration into the
   new product introduction is the key parameter for successfully new
   product introduction, which may contribute to supply chain
   reconfiguration. Consequently By considering the new product development
   concept, we may face with dynamic supply chain configuration during a
   planning horizontal time. In this study, a new model is presented to
   consider the dynamic configuration of a supply chain by developing new
   products. In the proposed model, the dynamic configuration of a supply
   chain and the new product launching time is optimized simultaneously.
   The proposed model considers production, sales and transportation
   planning for the entire supply chain in order to achieve an integrative
   and efficient supply as well. Then some numerical analyses have been
   done to show the applicability of the proposed model. The results show
   that the new product development has a significant effect on the

Title = {From traditional interorganisational systems to cloud-based solutions:
   The impact on supply chain flexibility},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {334-353},
Abstract = {The fast changing business environment and the intensive market
   competition forces firms to adjust and remodel their business strategy
   continuously. As a solution, firms seek flexibility, not only internally
   but also at the level of their supply chain. To accomplish this,
   companies invest in information technology (IT), aiming to improve their
   business processes and collaboration with trading partners. As previous
   research supports, the use of IT combined with agile supply chain
   management improves business performance and offers sustainable
   competitive advantage. However, the extent to which IT enables and
   supports supply chain flexibility is still debatable and warrants
   investigation. Although contemporary Internet-based systems (web-based
   platforms and cloud-based solutions) seem to overcome the rigidity and
   inflexibility of traditional interorganisational systems (IOS), they are
   still associated with issues of interoperability and incompatibility.
   Although they facilitate supply chain collaboration, by providing access
   to all stakeholders and enabling information-sharing, they may often
   lead to closed networks of collaboration. To examine these issues, this
   paper primarily aims to clarify the notion of flexibility at the level
   of the supply chain. It also aims to contribute to the process by which
   organisations effectively evaluate and prioritise competing IT
   investments. Taking into consideration the multidimensional nature of
   flexibility, this paper proposes a conceptual framework of supply chain
   flexibility, distinguishing between the operational, structural, and
   strategic levels of flexibility. It then uses this framework to explain
   the impact of IT infrastructures (specifically comprising traditional
   IOS, web-based collaboration platforms and cloud-based solutions) on the
   various levels of flexibility. Based on previous research, it identifies
   specific IT characteristics and provides an approach through which
   practitioners and researchers can compare different technologies and
   analyse their benefits and limitations, in terms of supply chain
   flexibility.},

Abstract = {After a disaster happens, emergency response operations are critical to
   save humans' lives and properties. The limited resources and time
   requirements call for coordinated supply chain operations. This paper
   studies supply chain operations for rescue kits in disaster reliefs,
   motivated by a real-world application. The objective is to minimise the
   total tardiness and peak tardiness of product delivery over the
   multi-period planning horizon. One major challenge is the lack of
   reliable prediction of customer demand in disasters. In order to cope
   with demand uncertainty while maintaining the tractability of the
   optimisation model, we decompose the demand into two components: a
   relatively stable base demand predicted by historical data and
   unpredictable demand surges. For the base demand, an optimisation model
   is developed to optimise the production and distribution operations, as
   well as the inventory replenishment policy for manufacturers and
   distribution centres, so as to minimise the total tardiness. For the
   demand surges, we propose to deploy supply chain flexibility to cope
   with the uncertainty. An empirical study shows the effectiveness of
   increasing supply chain flexibility and suggests some managerial
   insights on configuring such flexibility in emergency operations.},

Abstract = {When ocean transportation is used, possible disruptions both at sea and
   on land should be taken into account in the planning process of the
   affected supply chain. In this paper, a framework to enable flexible
   global supply chain operational planning in stochastic environments is
   presented. In order to cope with unexpected events like natural or
   man-made disasters, flexible international long-distance transportation
   modes and postponement strategies are taken into account in our supply
   chain model. In order to balance supply chain costs and the flexibility
   of supply chains, a two-stage multi-scenario stochastic programming
   model is developed where the stochastic events are represented by
   corresponding scenarios. High quality solutions of all our problem
   instances are generated by using a Python based stochastic programming
   framework to solve the model. Finally, managerial insights related to
   flexible supply chain planning in stochastic environments are derived
   from our computational results.},

   design problem with different delivery modes},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Flexible supply chain networks are one of the most effective class of
   supply chains in both manufacturing and service sectors. In such
   networks, different delivery modes can significantly influence the
   efficiency of the entire supply chain. In this paper, a mixed integer
   linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for a multi-product
   four-stage flexible supply chain network design (SCND) problem in a
   solid transportation environment. The presented model considers three
   different delivery modes namely normal delivery, direct shipment and
   direct delivery. Since the problem is NP-hard, meta-heuristic approaches
   should be used to solve it. For this aim, ten classical and adaptive
   meta-heuristic algorithms are developed. In order to calibrate the
   parameters of the proposed algorithms, a typical experimental study is
   done. After the parameter setting stage, the final experiments on some
   randomly generated test problems are performed. The Obtained results
   demonstrate that the proposed adaptive vibration damping optimization
   (AVDO) algorithm performs better than the other algorithms.},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {In the context of the digital economy, establishing close strategic
   partnerships to cope with market uncertainties is an important strategic
   choice for firms seeking to achieve sustainable development in
   developing countries, particularly in Eastern culture. However, research
   on how strategic partnerships affect enterprise performance remains
   controversial. To address this issue, based on the supply chain
   management practices of Chinese enterprises in the era of the digital
   economy, and according to resource dependence theory, social network
   theory, and transaction cost theory, a chain multiple intermediary model
   was constructed and 243 Chinese enterprises information was collected
   for an empirical test. The results show that strategic partnership has a
   significant direct positive impact on information sharing, supply chain
   flexibility, and enterprise performance. Information sharing has a
   significant direct positive impact on enterprise performance and plays a
   partial mediating role between strategic partnership and enterprise
   performance. Supply chain flexibility was also found to positively
   impact enterprise performance and plays a partial mediating role between
   strategic partnership and enterprise performance. The findings also
   showed that information sharing and supply chain flexibility play a
   chain mediating role between strategic partnership and enterprise
   performance. This study explores the effects of strategic partnership on
   enterprise performance, which provides an important supplement to
   theoretical studies of supply chain management. The results help provide
   targeted solutions on how to effectively implement supply chain
   management for enterprises in emerging and developing nations.},

Abstract = {The recent trade friction between the two largest economies, US and
   China, is having a profound impact on the sustainable development of
   supply chains at a global scale. Supply chain collaborative innovation
   has not only become the main means for enterprises in various countries
   to cope with imponderable changes, but also been the driver of
   increasing supply chain dynamic capability and of achieving sustainable
   development of supply chains. Based on the survey data of 510 Chinese
   enterprises, this paper adopts the hierarchical regression analysis and
   a structural equation model to study the impact of supply chain
   collaborative innovation on the sustainable development of supply
   chains. The results show that: (1) Three modes of supply chain
   collaborative innovation (namely, technology collaborative innovation,
   management collaborative innovation, and market collaborative
   innovation) have different effects on supply chain dynamic capability
   and sustainable supply chain performance. (2) Supply chain dynamic
   capability plays a significant intermediary role between supply chain
   collaborative innovation and sustainable supply chain performance. (3)
   Supply chain technology collaborative innovation has the greatest direct
   impact on sustainable supply chain performance, followed by supply chain
   management collaborative innovation. However, the direct effect of
   supply chain market collaborative innovation on sustainable supply chain
   performance is not significant; under the intermediary role of dynamic
   capability, supply chain market collaborative innovation has a
   significant indirect effect on sustainable supply chain performance.},

Volume = {128},
Pages = {290-305},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Flexibility in supply chain networks dealing with uncertainty, has
   become a research challenge over the past years. This work proposes a
   flexible supply chain network design (SCND) model that uses generalized
   production/warehousing nodes instead of individual production plants and
   warehouses while conquers with demand uncertainty using a scenario-based
   approach. It also deals with inventory management and decisions on
   strategical and tactical level (facility location, production rate,
   warehouse capacity, demand allocation between generalized nodes,
   inventory levels, product flows, suppliers' product availability and
   links between all facilities). The proposed Mixed-Integer Linear
   Programming (MILP) model allows intra-layer flows between generalized
   nodes and aims at minimizing total network cost. A case study is formed
   to test the applicability of the model for a medium sized European
   company. A comparison was made between a classic supply chain network
   and generalized network that deals with uncertainty. Results have
   revealed cost benefits for this model, making it not only applicable,
   but also cost effective for the company that will apply it. This
   decision support system, can help managers in taking strategic decisions
   such as facility location, with a higher level of accuracy. (C) 2017

Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {256-278},
Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to analyze the mediating role of Supply Chain
   Flexibility on the interrelationships binding Lean Production
   implementation, Mass Personalization and business performance.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A random sample of 260 companies obtained from a population of 1,717
   Spanish companies that occupy an intermediate position in the supply
   chain has been used to test the proposed hypothetical framework.
   Telephone surveys using a computerized system have been used to collect
   data, obtaining a response rate of 15.6 and a structural equation model
   has been designed to test the six proposed hypotheses.
   Findings
   Companies initially implement Lean Production to optimize Mass
   Personalization processes and improve business performance. However, in
   the presence of Supply Chain Flexibility, Lean Production implementation
   no longer has a direct impact on Mass Personalization and business
   performance, but it does have an indirect impact through the flexibility
   it achieves (shown as a total mediating path). Therefore, companies
   should implement Lean Production to achieve flexibility and thus
   optimize the Mass Personalization processes and obtain better
   performance.
   Originality/value
   Academics and business managers may have supporting evidence on the role
   played by the total mediating effect of Supply Chain Flexibility on the
   relationship between Lean Production, Mass Personalization and business
   performance. A better knowledge of these management resources and their
   relationship could affect the way researchers and practitioners approach
   them, becoming more aware of the important role of the supply chain in
   competitiveness.},

Title = {Supply chain flexibility in dynamic environments: The enabling role of
   operational absorptive capacity and organisational learning},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS \& PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {636-666},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse the relationship between
   environmental dynamism and supply chain flexibility (SCF) and to
   evaluate if two dynamic capabilities, i.e. operational absorptive
   capacity (OAC) and organisational learning (OL), are necessary
   competences for firms to develop such a responsive supply chain strategy
   as flexibility.
   Design/methodology/approach Hypothesised relationships are tested with
   survey data from 302 Spanish manufacturing firms using structural
   equations modelling.
   Findings Environmental dynamism is positively associated with both OAC
   and OL, and both dynamic capabilities enable SCF. The authors also find
   that the relationship between environmental dynamism and SCF is
   partially mediated by both dynamic capabilities.
   Research limitations/implications The study contributes to the
   literature, for example, by determining when it is advantageous to
   develop SCF, by specifying what capabilities a firm needs to develop to
   align SCF with the environment, and by opening the black box that is the
   relationship between the environment and SCF.
   Practical implications Managers should develop SCF via OAC and OL when
   they detect a high degree of environmental dynamism. Knowing when this
   is necessary relies on a good understanding of the environment. OAC is
   found to be a stronger enabler of SCF than OL. The findings provide
   managers with an insight into why some firms are able to develop more
   effective responses to dynamic environments than others.
   Originality/value This study is one of only a limited number of studies
   that adopt a dynamic capabilities approach to supply chain management.
   Prior literature has shown that dynamic capabilities can aid in
   developing strategic, structural, and operational flexibility. The
   authors extend this literature by showing that OAC and OL have an effect
   on SCF.},

Title = {Optimizing dynamic supply chain formation in supply mesh using CSET
   model},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {569-588},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A new e-Service model called dynamic supply chain is characterized by
   their dynamic nature in easily being formed and disbanded with the
   seamless connectivity provided by e-Marketplace. The new term ``supply
   mesh{''} was coined to represent this virtual community of companies in
   which dynamic supply chains, as per project (also known as
   make-to-order), are formed across different tiers of suppliers. In a
   supply mesh, a dynamic supply chain can be formed vertically, from the
   top to the bottom layers, mediating different companies for a project.
   Companies that are on the same level laterally are usually competitors,
   and the companies that are linked vertically as supply chains are
   trading partners. From a global view, the companies that are connected
   in the supply mesh can be viewed as individual entities that have
   self-interest. They may compete for survival as well as collaborate with
   each other for jobs. Given such complex relations the challenge is to
   find an optimal group of members for a dynamic supply chain in the
   supply mesh. A multi-agent model called the collaborative single machine
   earliness/tardiness (CSET) model was recently proposed for the optimal
   formation of make-to-order supply chains. This paper investigates the
   possibilities of applying CSET in a supply mesh, and the corresponding
   allocation schemes are experimentally studied in simulations. One scheme
   called Cost-driven principle leads to destructive competition while the
   other one namely Pareto-optimal evolves into a cooperative competition
   that tries to mutually benefit every participant. The results, based on
   samples from the U.S. textile industry, show that a cooperative
   competition scheme is superior in terms of optimal allocation, which
   obtains maximum satisfaction for all participants.},

Abstract = {Human factors play an important role in the success of companies,

   paper, we propose a structural equation model that measures the impact
   of four human factors (knowledge, abilities, skills, and availability)
   on production process flexibility and supply chain agility in the wine
   industry of La Rioja, Spain. The results obtained indicate that these
   human factors have a direct and positive impact on production process
   flexibility and supply chain agility. Likewise, they can be indirectly
   linked to supply chain agility through production process flexibility.
   Based on these findings, this research encourages La Rioja wineries to
   jointly work with viticulture and enology programs of Spanish
   universities. This collaboration would enhance the impact of human
   factors on the wine industry, which would in turn allow wineries to

Journal = {DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2017},
Abstract = {To better understand the different effects of themyopic and far-sighted
   behaviors on the advertising coordination in dynamic supply chain, this
   paper takes the reference price effect into consideration and formulates
   four differential game models for the two-level supply chain composed of
   a manufacturer and a retailer in the situation of Stackelberg game. In
   our models, the market demand is assumed to be affected by the goodwill,
   reference price, and the advertising investment, in which the
   advertising investment can promote the construction of goodwill and such
   goodwill can further enhance the reference price. The results show that
   the participating members in the supply chain should invest more in
   advertisement to improve the goodwill and the relative reference price
   reflected in the minds of consumers. A far-sighted manufacturer will
   invest more in the advertisement and charge a higher wholesale price
   regardless of the behavior choice of the retailer. However, such kind of
   ignorance leads to different results on the retail pricing strategies of
   the retailer. The numerical analyses are given in the end to verify the
   effectiveness of the conclusions which provide the theoretical support
   to the dynamic supply chain coordination in practice.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to map the causal relations among various
   supply chain flexibility (SCF) dimensions having significant impact on
   the Indian personal hygiene industry.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The author(s) have gone through extensive literature review and
   extracted 22 SCF dimensions. After conducting field visits and expert
   interaction in the firm related to case industry, 11 major SCF
   dimensions that seem to have a significant amount of influence on supply
   chain performance of the firms were retained for further consideration.
   The author(s) have used decision making trial and evaluation laboratory
   (DEMATEL) to establish initial causality and structural equation model
   (SEM) to investigate the contribution of different flexibility
   dimensions on overall SCF.
   Findings
   After DEMATEL analysis, three major SCF dimensions were considered for
   SEM modeling. The result shows that product flexibility and physical
   distribution flexibility have favorable influence on the SCF, while the
   demand management flexibility adversely impacts overall SCF.
   Practical implications - The approach adopted in the study can help
   firms to determine and exercise the flexibility dimensions of a
   particular supply chain. The DEMATEL and SEM offer a facilitation to
   explain the causal relationship between the different dimensions to take
   long-term decisions and address the uncertainty in the demand and supply
   side.
   Originality/value
   This paper has made an attempt to evaluate the supply chain
   flexibilities, prioritize them and evaluate the relationship amongst
   these flexibilities and the degree to which they affect or are affected

Title = {Formulation and analysis of dynamic supply chain of backfill in

Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {878-888},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Backfill is the excavated material from earthworks, which constitutes
   over 50\% of the construction wastes in Hong Kong. This paper considers
   a supply chain that consists of construction sites, landfills and
   commercial sources in which operators seek cooperation to maximize
   backfill reuse and improve waste recovery efficiency. Unlike the
   ordinary material supply chain in manufacturing industries, the supply
   chain for backfill involves many dynamic processes, which increases the
   complexity of analyzing and solving the logistic issue. Therefore, this
   study attempts to identify an appropriate methodology to analyze the
   dynamic supply chain, for facilitating the backfill reuse. A centralized
   optimization model and a distributed agent-based model are proposed and
   implemented in comparing their performances. The centralized
   optimization model can obtain a global optimum but requires sharing of
   complete information from all supply chain entities, resulting in
   barriers for implementation. In addition, whenever the backfill supply
   chain changes, the centralized optimization model needs to reconfigure
   the network structure and recompute the optimum. The distributed
   agent-based model focuses on task distribution and cooperation between
   business entities in the backfill supply chain. In the agent-based
   model, decision making and communication between construction sites,
   landfills, and commercial sources are emulated by a number of autonomous
   agents. They perform together through a negotiation algorithm for
   optimizing the supply chain configuration that reduces the backfill
   shipment cost. A comparative study indicates that the agent-based model
   is more capable of studying the dynamic backfill supply chain due to its
   decentralization of optimization and fast reaction to unexpected
   disturbances. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Because the supply network of an enterprise should be flexible enough to
   capture and overcome market dynamics, one of the major concerns of
   global enterprises is to make their supply network reconfigurable.
   Although many strategies for flexible management of a supply network
   have been proposed, especially for mitigating supply network risks, it
   still remains unclear how to apply the strategies to a supply network
   and how to reconfigure the supply network. This paper examines the
   influence of flexibility strategies in a dynamic global market
   environment on the structure of supply network, and proposes a method of
   reconfiguring the supply network of an enterprise to cope with its
   flexibility strategies. A reconfigurable supply network model is
   proposed, and flexibility strategies are classified, and critical
   indices of strategies are defined. In the proposed model, each business
   actor is defined as a network node and each node has its own goal. A
   node optimizes its goal to reduce and overcome the risk of market
   environments. The result of optimization indicates that the supply
   network structure is reconfigured dynamically. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Purpose The occurrence of disaster and crisis is increasing. They are
   complex as well as challenging for humanitarian organizations (HOs) and
   societies involved in disaster relief operations. This study examined
   the nexus between supply chain flexibility (SCF) and humanitarian supply
   chain performance (HSCP) among HOs with empirical evidence from HOs in
   Ghana. Design/methodology/approach The study employed the quantitative
   method to explore the interdependencies among the variables. In
   congruence with this, the study employed the purposive and convenience
   sampling technique to obtain information from 168 respondents. The
   analysis was done using SPSS version 23 and Smart PLS version 3.
   Findings The outcome indicates that intercluster coordination (ICC)
   plays a significant mediating role between SCF and HSCP. Practical
   implications The outcome of the study indicates that a closer and
   stronger relationship ensures proper channel use among the HOs. This
   will improve the performance of the supply chain of HOs and their
   ability to deal with supply chain uncertainties. Originality/value The
   discovery of this study provides empirical support to the resource-based
   view theory. Thus, practitioners in the humanitarian setting give
   priority to factors that could enhance flexibility in their supply chain

   imperative. However, no systematic and scientific research has been
   conducted to develop such an instrument. The present study adopts a
   comprehensive and rigorous procedure to develop a multifaceted scale for
   SCF through an empirical investigation. The results of a confirmatory
   factor analysis suggest that SCF can be operationalized as a
   second-order factor model comprising four dimensions, namely: sourcing
   flexibility, operating system flexibility, distribution flexibility, and
   information system flexibility. A series of goodness-of-fit indices
   further demonstrates that this scale is internally consistent, reliable,
   and valid. The various findings suggested in the present study provide a
   more succinct picture of SCF, and the well-validated scale could be used
   as a basis for further research and theoretical groundwork in the field
   of supply chain management. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Due to rapid globalization, an introduction of Goods and Services Taxes
   (GST), ban on BS-III vehicles, and rapid technological advancement
   creates new dimensions for the automobile industry in India especially
   for those who come in the category of small and medium enterprise
   (SMEs). In the current changing scenario victorious execution of supply
   chain management (SCM) practices can provide competitive leverage to
   Automobile manufacturers over their rivals particularly those who are
   poorly implemented supply chain management practices. This paper takes
   two main SCM practices, i.e. supply chain flexibility (SCF) and supply
   chain strategy (SCS). Against this background, this paper acknowledged 5
   success factors (SFs) for supply chain flexibility and 3 success factors
   (SFs) for supply chain strategy for proper implementation of SCM
   practices in the Automobile industry, and studied their impact on three
   factors of supply chain performance (SCP), and thereby on firms
   performance. The top management of any industry is focused on their core
   strength with commitment, long-term vision and provides resources for
   supply chain, and thereby developing effective and efficient SCS emerged
   as the most significant SFs. To measure the impact on supply chain
   performance, the author carefully measures different SFs of SCS related
   to customer-oriented strategy, innovation strategy and agile supply
   chain strategy on cost performance, logistics performance and customer
   satisfaction performance. Similarly to access the impact on supply chain
   performance, carefully measure different SFs of SCF on cost performance,
   logistics performance and customer satisfaction performance. Results are
   analyzed by testing research propositions using standard statistical
   tools like reliability analysis, correlation analysis and regression
   analysis using SPSS-23.},

Abstract = {The circular economy (CE) is an evolving economic and sustainable
   development model. In this new environment, companies face a more
   dynamic, uncertain, and complex market environment. These challenges
   arise from material closed-loop flows necessary for a functioning CE. It
   is important to build flexibility capabilities into sustainable supply
   chains to address CE operational challenges. Building this operational
   capability needs to occur without incurring performance degradation,
   increasing costs, or compromising product quality. Supply chain
   designers have recognised the importance of sustainable supply chain
   flexibility (SSCF) efforts for meeting CE-targeted performance.
   CE-targeted performance includes reuse of materials and energy, closed
   flow of materials, and pollution reduction. Exploration of relationships
   between SSCF efforts and CE-targeted performance is limited. An
   objective-DEMATEL method is used to evaluate the relationship between a
   new SSCF measures framework and CE-targeted performance. A field study
   helps to identify and refine significant SSCF measures (efforts) to
   effectively improve CE-targeted performance. Managerial implications and
   future research directions for sustainable supply chain flexibility
   within the CE environment are presented.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Shipbuilding materials are characterized by diverse kinds, large
   quantities and wide distribution of suppliers, which make the supply
   network complicated. Complex networks have led to increasing
   uncertainties that may cause disruptions in the supply chain.
   Flexibility is an effective measure to cope with uncertainty, thus this
   paper aims to integrate flexibility into the supply chain of
   shipbuilding materials and explore supply, logistics, organization and
   quality flexibility by focusing on the requirements of shipbuilding
   enterprises. This paper combines Quality Function Deployment (QFD),
   fuzzy theory and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory
   (DEMATEL) methods to guide practical design. After determining five
   customer requirements (CRs) and 24 design requirements (DRs), QFD links
   CRs and DRs to determine the most important feasible DRs for improvement
   of supply chain flexibility. Research results reveal that the most
   important design requirements can be summarized into four aspects,
   namely domestic procurement, supply chain member cooperation, supplier
   supervision, and emergency response construction. Moreover, it is found
   that long-term strategic partnerships with suppliers and strategic
   logistics outsourcing are effective strategies. This paper provides

Abstract = {The reconfiguration of supply chain is becoming a crucial concept used
   to deal with market disruptions and changes such as the COVID-19
   pandemic, demand uncertainty, and new technologies. It can be defined as
   the ability of the supply chain to change its structure and functions in
   order to adapt to new changes. Its assessment requires an understanding
   of its quantitative factors to provide indicators that are easy to
   interpret. Effective reconfigurability assessment can be achieved by
   measuring quantitatively its six characteristics (modularity,
   integrability, convertibility, diagnosability, scalability, and
   customization). This paper aims at identifying the quantitative factors
   of each characteristic and their inter-relationships by using Total
   Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM). The structural model obtained
   by TISM is applied to understand the dependency quantitative factors.
   Based on TISM results, a classification of quantitative factors is
   determined using ``Matrice d ` Impacts Croises, Multiplication Appliquee
   a un Classement{''} (MICMAC) analysis. This article provides a better
   understanding of the six characteristics previously mentioned to improve
   the reconfigurability of supply chains by considering the interactions
   between their factors. Thus, this analysis helps managers to understand
   the characteristics that influence the change of the supply chain
   structure and those that enable changing the supply chain functions in
   order to optimize the supply chain reconfiguration process.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to determine the antecedents of dynamic
   supply chain capabilities (DSCCs). The authors test entrepreneurial
   orientation (EO) and supply chain learning orientation (SCLO) as two
   antecedents of DSCCs.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The paper uses structural equation modelling to test a hypothetical
   model. Data are gathered from a survey of 275 operations managers in
   Pakistan's turbulent manufacturing industry.
   Findings
   The findings suggest that the weaker direct effects of EO, in comparison
   to the indirect effects, indicate that an SCLO mediates the relationship
   between EO and DSCCs.
   Practical implications
   Managers are given the building blocks of DSCCs, starting with fostering
   an entrepreneurially-oriented mindset in the company and then learning
   with supply chain partners. Entrepreneurially-oriented managers are
   encouraged to take risks and co-develop innovative ideas with suppliers
   during the supply chain learning process.
   Originality/value
   This study is one of the earliest efforts to determine the strategic
   orientations that antecede the emergence of DSCCs.},

Abstract = {Purpose From the perspective of the economic theory of complementarity,
   the purpose of this paper is to examine how internal collaboration and
   external competencies would provoke and strengthen each other, and
   subsequently enhance organizational innovation capability.
   Design/methodology/approach The survey data were collected from 201
   manufacturing firms and checked for common method variance, validity and
   reliability. Structural equation modeling was then used to test the
   hypothetical complementarity effect. Findings The results suggest that
   internal collaboration (as a manifestation of exploitative learning) and
   external competencies, which include supply network flexibility and
   supplier operational capabilities (as manifestation of exploratory
   learning), do in fact compensate for each other's deficiencies.
   Complementary deployment of internal collaboration and external
   competencies enhances each other's contribution to innovation
   capability. Practically, the study indicates that organizations should
   consider making concerted efforts to develop internal collaboration,
   supply network flexibility and supplier operational capability as a
   bundle. Originality/value Extensive discussions exist in the literature
   on exploration and exploitation being essential components of innovation
   and their conflicting impact on innovation efficiency and effectiveness.
   But how an organization should operationally develop supply chain
   competencies in order to maximize overall innovation capability still
   remains largely an unanswered question. The current study advances the
   research on the inter-relationships between exploration and exploitation
   by empirically demonstrating the complementary nature of internal

Title = {Linking supply network flexibility with mass customization capability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS \& INDUSTRIAL MARKETING},
Abstract = {Purpose The importance of supply network flexibility (SNF) in the
   development of mass customization capability (MCC) has been implied in
   the literature but seldom subjected to empirical investigation. To fill
   the gap and contribute to MC literature, this paper aims to examine the
   role of SNF in facilitating the development of MCC of organizations.
   Furthermore, it has been investigated whether the use of information and
   communication technologies (ICTs) strengthens the above relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the supply chain literature and
   dynamic capability theory, the study proposes a research framework
   depicting the interconnectedness among the variables of interest. The
   proposed framework has been tested using structural equation modelling
   based on partial least squares by using the data collected from a
   questionnaire-based survey of a sample of Indian manufacturing
   organizations. Findings The findings indicate that the dimensions of
   SNF, namely, sourcing flexibility and supplier flexibility, positively
   affect the MCC of the organizations and the strength of these
   relationships is further amplified by the implementation of ICTs.
   Practical implications The study shows the managerial opportunities for
   the development of a flexible and competent supply network to facilitate
   the development or enhancement of MCC. Originality/value This study
   contributes to scant literature by providing empirical evidence for the
   relationship between SNF and MCC. Further, this study enriches the
   understanding of the crucial role of ICT by exploring its moderating

Title = {Dynamic supply chain scheduling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SCHEDULING},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {201-216},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Based on a combination of fundamental results of modern optimal program
   control theory and operations research, an original approach to supply
   chain scheduling is developed in order to answer the challenges of
   dynamics, uncertainty, and adaptivity. Both supply chain schedule
   generation and execution control are represented as an optimal program
   control problem in combination with mathematical programming and
   interpreted as a dynamic process of operations control within an
   adaptive framework. Hence, the problems and models of planning,
   scheduling, and adaptation can be consistently integrated on a unified
   mathematical axiomatic of modern control theory. In addition, operations
   control and flow control models are integrated and applicable for both
   discrete and continuous processes. The application of optimal control
   for supply chain scheduling becomes possible by formulating the
   scheduling model as a linear non-stationary finite-dimensional
   controlled differential system with the convex area of admissible
   control and a reconfigurable structure. For this model class, theorems
   of optimal control existence can be used regarding supply chain
   scheduling. The essential structural property of this model are the
   linear right parts of differential equations. This allows applying
   methods of discrete optimization for optimal control calculation. The
   calculation procedure is based on applying Pontryagin's maximum
   principle and the resulting essential reduction of problem
   dimensionality that is under solution at each instant of time. The
   gained insights contribute to supply chain scheduling theory, providing
   advanced insights into dynamics of the whole supply chains (and not any
   dyadic relations in them) and transition from a partial ``one-way{''}
   schedule optimization to the feedback loop-based dynamic and adaptive
   supply chain planning and scheduling.},

Abstract = {Purpose Scholars have recently begun to empirically evaluate the
   triple-A supply chain, which emphasizes concurrent capabilities in
   agility, adaptability and alignment across the supply chain to develop
   sustainable competitive advantage. Complexity theory suggests however
   that other combinations of triple-A capabilities may be equally
   effective, especially given a firm's strategic orientation relative to
   its market and its supply chain. Our research objective was to examine
   what combinations of these capabilities lead to the same outcome (i.e.
   high firm performance). Design/methodology/approach We collected 182
   survey responses from a global sample of supply chain managers.
   Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) was employed to assess effective
   recipes of agility, adaptability, alignment, supply chain orientation,
   and market orientation. Findings Our results revealed four distinct
   ``recipes{''} (i.e. combinations of agility, adaptability, alignment,
   supply chain orientation and market orientation) that lead to high
   levels of firm performance. Originality/value Our results indicate that
   firms currently do not necessarily have to concomitantly develop
   capabilities across all triple-A components. Considering the costs
   associated with developing each of these capabilities, the findings
   allow us to derive several theoretical and managerial insights.},

Title = {LESSONS FROM EMPIRICAL STUDIES IN SUPPLY CHAIN FLEXIBILITY: A MATURITY
   PERSPECTIVE},
Journal = {BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS \& PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Goal: To analyze supply chain flexibility (SCF) within real-life
   settings from a maturity perspective and provide a discussion on the
   importance of a maturity model for SCF.
   Design/Methodology/Approach: A multiple case study was conducted in
   multinational manufacturing companies from different business sectors,
   offering a within-case and cross-case analysis.
   Results: The empirical evidence revealed that the studied companies do
   not consider flexibility measures. This absence renders difficulties
   when striving for external flexibility, for instance, affecting planning
   and control activities. Furthermore, the conducted analysis showed that
   sharing information among supply chain members has a significant impact
   on the identification of changes in the processes, enabling a correct
   and quick reaction to these changes.
   Limitations of the investigation: The results are restricted to the
   studied companies; therefore, the SCF maturity model deserves more
   application through the development of more empirical investigations.
   Practical implications: This is a guide for practitioners to identify
   the current maturity level of their SCF, and subsequently improve the
   processes, aiming to achieve the desired result.
   Originality/Value: This paper addresses the lack of theoretical and
   empirical studies in the literature regarding the analysis of SCF
   maturity and its different levels, thus enabling practitioners and
   researchers to improve the understanding of maturity in the SCF context.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper aims to understand the specific role that supply chain
   flexibility (SCF) can play in the successful adoption of green
   operations (GO) strategies based on evidence from the automotive
   industry. By conducting an exploratory case study with three automakers,
   it is found that different GO strategies require the support of
   different SCF dimensions. More importantly, the magnitude of the role
   played by each flexibility dimension varies depending on the degree of
   innovativeness in the green design initiatives, the types of green
   purchasing initiatives, and the strategic orientation of green
   manufacturing initiatives being adopted. Our case studies contribute to
   the theoretical understanding of the complex SCF-GO relationship by
   identifying the essential theoretical constructs and indicating their
   lower layer interactions in a systematic way. In practice, our findings
   may help managers assess which SCF dimensions can contribute more
   significantly to their specific GO efforts, and then strategically plan,
   develop, and deploy relevant flexibility to support beneficial outcomes.
   Our study contributes to the OM literature by clarifying the
   multidimensional effects of SCF on GO.},

Abstract = {Innovation is the continuous source of power for the survival and
   development of SMEs, but the complexity of innovation and the limitation
   of resources make SMEs trapped in the dilemma of ``innovation
   difficulty{''}. A moderated mediating model was constructed based on
   social network theory and resource view, and fuzzy set qualitative
   comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used to empirically study the influence
   mechanism between network relationship characteristics and SMEs'
   innovation and the configuration path to achieve SMEs' high innovation
   performance. The results show that the characteristics of network
   relationships positively affect the innovation performance of SMEs.
   Supply chain dynamic capability plays an intermediary role between
   network relationships and SMEs' innovation relationships. Different
   geographical proximity levels of the supply chain lead to different
   coordination interaction and knowledge sharing efficiency between
   upstream and downstream, which not only positively moderates the
   relationship between supply chain dynamic capability and SMEs'
   innovation performance, but also moderates its mediating effect.
   Furthermore, the fs QCA analysis results show three configurations for
   SMEs' high innovation performance based on the characteristics of
   network relations: geographic proximity regulating type, network

Title = {Adaptive Variable Neighborhood Search-Based Supply Network
   Reconfiguration for Robustness Enhancement},
Journal = {COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {Robustness of a supply network highly depends on its structure. Although
   structural design methods have been proposed to create supply networks
   with optimal robustness, a real-life supply network can be quite
   different from these optimal structural designs. Meanwhile, real cases
   such as Thailand floods and Tohoku earthquake demonstrate the
   vulnerability of supply networks in real life. Obviously, it is urgent
   to enhance the robustness of existing real-life supply networks. Thus,
   in this paper, a supply network reconfiguration method based on adaptive
   variable neighborhood search (AVNS) is proposed to enhance the
   structural robustness of supply networks facing both random and target
   disruptions. Firstly, a supply network model considering the
   heterogeneous roles of entities is introduced. Based on the model, two
   robustness metrics, R-r and R-t, are proposed to describe the tolerance
   of supply networks facing random and target disruptions, respectively.
   Then, the problem of reconfiguration-based supply network robustness
   enhancement is described. To solve the problem effectively and
   efficiently, a new heuristic based on general variable neighborhood
   search, namely, AVNS, is proposed. Finally, a case study based on three
   real-life supply networks is presented to verify the applicability and
   effectiveness of the proposed robustness enhancing method.},

Title = {Improving retail supply flexibility using buyer-supplier relational
   capabilities},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS \& PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {343-362},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role
   of three important relational capabilities - absorptive capacity (AC),
   transactive memory systems (TMS), and organisational interoperability
   (OI); on the flexibility of buyer-supplier relationships and performance
   in retail supply chains. Drawing on the relational view of strategic
   management, the impact of relational capabilities on two forms of supply
   chain flexibility is examined - configuration flexibility (CF) for
   switching suppliers with minimal penalties, and planning and control
   flexibility (PCF) for altering supply schedules, quality, and delivery
   lead-time.
   Design/methodology/approach - Strategic-and tactical-level managers from
   211 retail stores in the UK were surveyed. The authors validated a
   measurement model with structural equation modelling and tested four
   hypotheses on the mediating role of relational capabilities on supply
   chain flexibility and retail performance, controlling for size, duration
   of relationship, and market segment.
   Findings - Results showed that the three relational capabilities
   partially mediated the positive effect of CF and PCF on operational
   performance in big middle and niche retailers. Examining the interaction
   effect of the forms of flexibility on the relational capabilities and
   performance, the authors found positive interaction effects on TMS and
   OI but a non-significant effect on AC.
   Practical implications -In addition to providing novel theoretical
   insights on supply chain flexibility, the findings have practical
   implications for supplier selection and buyer-supplier relationship
   management.
   Originality/value - Overall, the study highlights the impacts of
   relational capabilities on adopted operational strategies such as
   flexibility, buyer-supplier relationships, and retail performance.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to explore the current state of research on
   supply chain flexibility (SCF) and mass personalization (MP) to identify
   the literature findings to date, research gaps and to provide guidelines
   for future research in this area. Design/methodology/approach A
   systematic literature review of 64 papers was undertaken to address the
   use of SCF as a productive response to MP environments. The methodology
   used is made up of five steps: formulation of the research questions,
   identification of studies, selection and evaluation of studies, analysis
   and synthesis and presentation of the results. Findings Three main
   research topics have been identified: personalization levels and
   flexible processes in supply chain, where flexible processes in supply
   chain are analysed as a productive response to high levels of MP; supply
   chain collaborative processes for SCF and MP, where product co-creation
   and relationships between supply chain members is analysed; and SCF and
   MP enabling technologies, in which technologies to support MP
   implementation and SCF are considered. Each of these three main topics
   have been divided into research lines and research sublines that allowed
   identifying a positive relationship between the SCF and the MP
   strategies. Research limitations/implications - Systematic literature
   review is a methodology reliable and recommended by a large number of
   scientific papers. However, it depends on available and accessible
   research studies and the researcher's criteria. The selection of certain
   criteria for inclusion and exclusion of papers introduces publication
   bias, which should be considered an intrinsic limitation to systematic
   literature review. Originality/value The main literature findings in
   each research line and subline related to the SCF-MP relationship are
   identified and analysed. Furthermore, research gaps and further research
   lines in the SCF-MP area are highlighted. The information presented in
   this paper improves the literature on the advances in the SCF use as a

Title = {Mediating Dynamic Supply Chain Formation by Collaborative Single Machine
   Earliness/Tardiness Agents in Supply Mesh},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {Nowadays, a trend of forming dynamic supply chains with different
   trading partners over different e-marketplaces has emerged. These supply
   chains, which are called ``supply mesh,{''} generally refer to
   heterogeneous electronic marketplaces in which dynamic supply chains, as
   per project (often make-to-order), are formed across different parties.
   Conceptually, in a supply mesh a dynamic supply chain is formed
   vertically, mediating several companies for a project. Companies that
   are on the same level horizontally are either competitors or cohorts. A
   complex scenario such as this makes it challenging to find the right
   group of members for a dynamic supply chain. Earlier on, a multiagent
   model called the collaborative single machine earliness/tardiness (CSET)
   model was proposed for the optimal formation of make-to-order supply
   chains. This paper contributes the particular agent designs, for
   enabling themediation of CSET in a supplymesh, and the possibilities are
   discussed. It is demonstrated via a computer simulation, based on
   samples fromthe U. S. textile industry, that by using intelligent agents
   under the CSET model it is possible to automatically find an ideal group
   of trading partners from a supply mesh.},

   flexibility in risk mitigation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {193},
Pages = {332-342},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In order to remain competitive in the market, firms are forced to expand
   their product offerings and offer high levels of customization, bringing
   about high uncertainty in their supply chain. Firms that face high
   environmental uncertainty are increasingly facing higher risks in terms
   of supply disruptions, production and delivery delays that ultimately
   result in poor operational performance. This study aims at understanding
   the antecedents of supply chain operational risk faced by firms and the
   conditions under which such risks can be mitigated. Using Indian data
   from the sixth edition of International Manufacturing Strategy Survey
   (IMSS) and structural equation modeling, we investigate the
   relationships between environmental uncertainty and supply chain risk
   and the moderating effect of supply chain flexibility. We identify
   appropriate types of flexibility to mitigate the three major aspects of
   supply chain risk: supply risk, manufacturing process risk and delivery
   risk. Our empirical investigation reveals that uncertainty in the supply
   chain leads to high supply chain risk; and in uncertain environments,
   supply and manufacturing flexibility help in reducing the supply and
   manufacturing process risks respectively. However, our results also
   indicate that, in emerging markets such as India where logistic
   infrastructure is less developed, internal capabilities alone may not be
   sufficient in reducing supply chain delivery risk. Our findings not only
   contribute towards filling certain gaps in the supply chain risk
   management literature, but also provide practicing managers and
   researchers a better understanding of the types of flexibility that can
   mitigate supply chain risk in different business environments.},

Title = {The performance effects of big data analytics and supply chain
   ambidexterity: The moderating effect of environmental dynamism},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {222},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The importance of big data analytics-enabled dynamic capability has been
   at the forefront of research for information systems management,
   operations management, and strategic management community. Prior studies
   have reported on the influence of big data analytics-enabled dynamic
   capability (BDA) for improved organizational agility and organizational
   performance, but there has been a paucity of literature regarding the
   role of big data analytics-enabled dynamic capability in untangling the
   supply chain ambidexterity dilemma and organizational performance. To
   address these research gaps, this paper draws on the dynamic capability
   view of the organization under the contingent effect of environmental
   dynamism. We tested our research hypotheses using 281 surveys, gathered
   using a pre-tested questionnaire. Our results suggest that BDA has
   positive effects on improving supply chain agility (SCAG), supply chain
   adaptability (SCAD) and performance measures (cost performance and
   operational performance). However, we noted that hypotheses regarding
   the moderating effect of environmental dynamism (ED) on the paths
   joining BDA and SCAG/SCAD were not supported. To address these
   unexpected results, we conducted post hoc analysis to explain the
   rationale behind the insignificant moderating effects of ED on the paths
   joining BDA and SCAG/SCAD. We found that the effects of BDA on SCAG/
   SCAD were higher under intermediate levels of environmental dynamism but
   comparatively weak when the environmental dynamism is low or high.
   Hence, we can argue that big data analytics can help enhance supply
   chain agility, supply chain adaptability, and organizational
   performance, but these effects are contingent upon the level of
   environmental dynamism. Moreover, a non-linear, inverse U-shaped
   moderating effect of environmental dynamism exists. Collectively, these
   findings provide a theory-based understanding of the organizational
   level of usage of big data analytics and its effects on supply chain
   agility, supply chain adaptability, and organizational performance.
   Moreover, they further shape our understanding of how big data
   analytics-enabled dynamic capabilities yield differential results under
   the moderating effect of environmental dynamism. Hence, we believe that
   our results will be useful for managers who are highly optimistic about
   the usage of these emerging technologies and their effects on supply
   chain characteristics. Finally, we have outlined our study limitations
   and offered numerous research directions.},

Abstract = {Effective demand management is an essential part of operations
   management, especially in the fashion industry. It helps enterprises
   avoid sales losses, increase inventory turnover, and raise firm
   performance. The major sources of effective and efficient demand
   management practices derive from the improvement in demand chain
   alignment competence (DCAC). By integrating dynamic capability theory
   and upper echelon theory, the present research discusses the role of
   DCAC and explores its main antecedents and consequences. Exploratory
   factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and hierarchical linear
   regression are conducted to analyze the data collected from 156 fashion
   enterprises. The results from qualitative interviews and quantitative
   analysis indicate that managerial cognition (MC) is a critical
   antecedent of DCAC. In addition, supply chain flexibility has a
   significantly positive moderating effect on the relationship between MC
   and DCAC. Further, DCAC primarily predicts firm performance. Finally,
   novel theoretical and empirical insights are discussed.},

Abstract = {Background. Educational games are widely used in business classes in
   general, and supply chain management (SCM) classes in particular. These
   games are designed to familiarize students with the real business world.
   Most SCM games are ready-made, with pre-set learning objectives focusing
   on a certain module in a supply chain. Intervention. This article
   presents the new spreadsheet-based Flexible Supply Chain Management Game
   (FSCMG) and the findings of its pilot study. FSCMG's features are
   transparent to instructors and students alike. It is easily modifiable
   to suit an instructor's learning objectives. Method. Six groups of
   undergraduate students took turns playing three modules, namely a
   wholesaler, manufacturer, and supplier. There were two groups per module
   to represent two supply chains. The students' spreadsheets are analyzed
   and presented. Results. Students' spreadsheets revealed that they were
   able to employ SCM conceptual understanding in FSCMG, particularly
   pricing strategy, inventory management, forecasting, and the
   relationships within a supply chain. Conclusion. FSCGM helped the
   students apply their in-class knowledge in a real-world situation and be
   well prepared for their future careers where an extensive understanding

Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between learning and adaptation
   in supply chains located within industrial districts, with the aim of
   identifying the best adaptive supply chain. It is motivated by the
   increasing attention that the design of adaptive supply chains has been
   receiving in recent years, as it is considered one of the most important
   critical factors in gaining sustainable competitive advantage in the
   current hypercompetitive environment. Focusing on two learning processes
   (i.e., by imitation and by interacting), diverse types of adaptive
   supply chains recognizable within industrial districts are compared by
   means of an agent-based simulation on the basis of their adaptive
   performance in environments characterized by different level of
   complexity and turbulence. The results confirm that the supply chain
   type influences the relationship between learning and adaptation and
   that both the product complexity and the turbulence of the environment
   moderate this effect. Finally, the best adaptive supply chain in each
   type of context is identified. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The modern supply chain network has geographically spread out across the
   globe. The performance of a customer service level is highly dependent
   on the effectiveness of its supply chain planning. To improve the
   service provided to downstream customers, planners must not only decide
   order allocation among multiple distribution centres but also consider
   reducing the order-to-delivery time. Directed shipment delivery from
   manufacturing sites provides the flexibility of direct shipment;
   however, it also makes order allocation more difficult. In this study, a
   flexible supply network planning (FSNP) model based on integer linear
   programming is developed for the memory module industry. In addition to
   multisite order allocation planning, the FSNP model explicitly considers
   directed shipment from manufacturing sites for reducing the
   order-to-delivery time. Furthermore, the combination of characteristics
   of the memory module industry, such as multilevel and multisite
   production environments, multiple-to-multiple product structures,
   transportation and production lead times and capacity constraints, makes
   FSNP highly complicated. The results of the experiments reveal that the
   FSNP model improves supply chain planning regarding order due date and
   inventory and transportation costs.},

Abstract = {Supply chain management has become one of the focal points of
   competition nowadays. The importance of information sharing in supply
   chain management is also increasing in terms of business performance
   improvement. In this study, five different models were developed to
   investigate the effect of information sharing in the supply chain
   process of businesses on cost, flexibility, response, delivery and
   financial performance. The relationships among these models are examined
   by means of a structural equation model (SEM). This paper is focused on
   supply chain process, supply chain flexibility, environmental
   uncertainties and information sharing latent structures whose cumulative
   effects on the determined performance indicators have been examined. The
   survey data obtained from the companies within the scope of the ISO
   (Istanbul Chamber of Industry) 1000 were used in the analyses conducted,
   whose results proved that all the suggested models were adequate in
   terms of validity and reliability. Furthermore, it was determined in all
   models that environmental uncertainties affect the supply chain process,
   while supply chain flexibility affects the supply chain process and
   information sharing.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to evaluate the
   roles of a transactive memory system and the supply network flexibility
   (SNF) of the firm as antecedents of a firm's supply chain agility
   (FSCA), also incorporating the moderating role of the transactive memory
   system; and, second, to evaluate the relationship between FSCA and
   operations performance (OP). Design/methodology/approach Four
   hypothesized relationships are tested with survey data from 190
   high-tech firms using structural equation models. Findings FSCA can be
   enhanced through the transactive memory system and SNF, although a
   higher degree of transactive memory system weakens the positive
   relationship between SNF and FSCA. A positive relationship is identified
   between FSCA and OP, while FSCA mediates the relationship between SNF
   and OP. Practical implications Managers can increase FSCA and improve OP
   by developing both the transactive memory system and SNF. Given that
   firms have limited resources, investment in internal capabilities should
   be prioritized as this appears to be more effective at developing FSCA.
   Originality/value The findings expand the literature by exploring two
   antecedents of FSCA and by analyzing the impact of FSCA on different
   measures of OP. Few prior studies have highlighted the importance of the

Abstract = {Purpose To analyze the effect of an ambidextrous supply chain strategy
   (ASCS) - i.e. the combination of exploration and exploitation practices
   - on each of the four dimensions of supply chain flexibility (SCF):
   information system, operating system, sourcing and distribution
   flexibility. Further, to evaluate the influence of implementing the ISO
   9001 standard on the relationship between ASCS and SCF, and whether this
   certification directly affects the level of SCF. We ground our model in
   Resource Orchestration theory. Design/methodology/approach To perform
   this study, the authors used data collected from a sample of 145
   non-ISO-certified firms and 157 ISO-certified firms. Findings ASCS does
   not affect all four dimensions of SCF in the same way. Rather, its
   effect is contingent on the presence of the ISO 9001 certification. An
   ASCS is shown to have a positive effect on information system
   flexibility irrespective of the presence of ISO 9001 certification
   whereas for the other three dimensions of SCF, the effect of ASCS is
   dependent on ISO 9001 implementation. Meanwhile, ISO 9001 implementation
   itself does not affect the level of SCF. Practical implications Managers
   can use the findings to configure their supply chain strategy based on
   the specific dimension(s) of SCF they seek to develop by implementing
   ASCS. Further, the results inform managers about the incentives for
   implementing ISO 9001. Originality/value Although prior studies have
   shown that an ambidextrous strategy enables firms and organizational
   units to adapt to the environment, there have been few prior studies on
   ambidexterity in a supply chain context. Further, although the extant
   literature has suggested that the ISO 9001 may facilitate ambidexterity,
   this link has remained largely theoretical. In fact, there is very
   little prior evidence on how the practice of ISO 9001 affects the supply
   chain.},

Volume = {167},
Pages = {951-961},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Direct digital manufacturing (DDM) is a combination of product modeling
   and manufacturing technology that directly converts digital models to
   physical objects without the need for tooling. The capability of DDM to
   improve the sustainability of products and processes is based on
   changing operational practices in product design, distribution, use, and
   after-sales services. Although research has provided evidence of the
   potential impact of DDM technologies, there is limited research on how
   specific DDM-based operational practices add to the operational
   capabilities of a manufacturer and how these capabilities can be used to
   improve sustainability outcomes. To address this research gap, we
   evaluate how current and future DDM-based operational practices can be
   used to improve products and processes. The analyzed current practices
   are in prototyping, tooling, on-demand parts manufacturing, and
   customized parts manufacturing. Two future practices that are evaluated
   are DDM-based incremental product improvement and dynamic supply chain
   reconfiguration.
   Based on the evaluation of current and future practices, we propose a
   design theory for the introduction of DDM into manufacturing firms for
   improving sustainability capabilities. The key contribution of this
   article is specifying the mechanisms by which a specific DDM-based
   operational practice improves sustainability outcomes and how each
   practice creates an operational practice threshold that needs to be
   reached before further improvement of capabilities is possible. Thus,
   using the theory new operational practices can be proactively developed
   and tested before the next threshold is reached. This in turn will help
   manufacturers develop strategies and investment plans for current and
   future DDM-based practices and to accumulate sustainability capabilities
   faster. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The blood platelets are a highly perishable product that requires
   accurate management. The concept of going green has become a necessity
   nowadays. The environmental concepts have been integrated in the
   supply-chain management in this study to design a complex multi-stage
   green supply-chain management of a highly perishable blood product. The
   main objective of this study is to minimize duplication by successful
   decision-making about locationallocation of blood facilities and develop
   an efficient network for blood platelet collection and distribution.
   This study incorporates green practices into the design of a dynamic
   supply chain management in the field of healthcare to reduce carbon
   emissions and ensure green platelet collection and delivery, while
   reducing the overall dynamic green supply chain costs. In addition, the
   proposed model helps to identify and determine candidate locations for
   blood services to meet patient demands and to build an effective
   network. The model is evaluated and validated through computational
   tests, while taking a specific case study in South Korea into
   consideration. The numerical results show that by managing waste

   Launch Success},
Journal = {DECISION SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {46},
Number = {5},
Pages = {901-936},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Many new product introductions continue to be unsuccessful, and while
   researchers have studied product development processes, relatively few
   studies directly address new product launch. We do so in the present
   research and posit that supply chain intelligence, defined as
   technological and competitive knowledge sourced and integrated from
   suppliers, customers, and competitors, plays an important role in
   explaining new product launch success. We further employ the
   knowledge-based view to theorize that both supply chain adaptability and
   product innovation capability act as important mediators of the effects
   of supply chain intelligence on new product launch success and firm
   financial performance. While the former capability refers to a firm's
   ability to quickly adjust its supply chain to react to market and
   product design changes, the latter refers to the firm's proficiency in
   developing innovative new products. We test hypothesized relationships
   among these factors utilizing data collected in a survey of 229 U.S.
   manufacturing firms. Results point to the central role of supply chain
   adaptability in capturing the benefits of supplier technological
   intelligence for enhanced product innovation capability, new product
   launch success, and firm financial performance. In contrast, product
   innovation capability serves as the generative means by which customer
   and competitor intelligence is translated into more successful new
   product launches, which, in turn, produce superior firm financial
   performance. Overall, these findings contribute to a better
   understanding of factors that can explain why certain product launches
   are more successful than others, and offer practical insights for
   appropriate investments in the development of related knowledge
   resources.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {To survive in the current competitive, unpredictable business
   environment, it is significant for firms to search and enforce
   capabilities that lead them to adapt and cope with dynamic changes of
   environment for their sustainability. We try to connect operation issues
   with sustainability in this paper. From the perspective of the dynamic
   capabilities of the firm, this study suggests a conceptual model that
   presents relationships among supply chain visibility, modular design,
   supply chain flexibility, and agility. We do not focus on the module
   buyer but on the small and middle-sized enterprises (SMEs). An empirical
   study is performed to verify the relationships proposed, using datasets
   collected from 232 manufacturing SMEs as module suppliers in South
   Korea. We used SPSS to analyze data and structural equation modeling to
   verify the hypotheses of the research model. The important contributions
   of this study are as follows. Firstly, we suggest relationships among
   supply chain visibilities and a modular design for supply chain
   flexibility and agility in sustainable performance. Secondly, we show
   that supply chain visibility directly leads firms to implement modular
   design in sustainable development. Thirdly, we verify the importance of
   supply chain visibility, not for module buyers, but for module suppliers
   by switching views in terms of SMEs' sustainability. Lastly, this study
   shows that the suppliers' modular design affects supply chain
   flexibility and agility, which is consistent with the findings presented

Abstract = {Supply chain management has both in academia and practice proven its
   important role to sustain and further develop companies' competitive
   advantages. This is with initiatives that focus on cost-efficiencies and
   turnover improvement. During the last two decades, companies have faced
   complexity in their supply chains currently with increased global
   operations. The dynamic business environment forces companies to secure
   a competitive (re-) design of their supply chains. This paper seeks to
   advance the understanding on the drivers and barriers for such designs.
   In total, 39 experts (30 from industrial enterprises, 4 senior supply
   chain consultants and 5 supply chain management professors) have
   participated in a four-step Delphi study and have identified main
   drivers for dynamic supply chain design as being cost reduction,
   delivery reliability and change in demand for agility. The main barriers
   are identified as forecasting being too weak, supply chain complexity
   and product portfolio complexity. In addition, an explorative factor
   analysis has been carried out to identify how drivers and barriers can
   be grouped together. Finally, the paper compares the drivers and
   barriers underlining different competitive strategies.},

Abstract = {Supply chain strategies depend on competitive environments as well as
   the nature of the particular business. Consequently, supply chain
   integration (SCI) strategies should also be evaluated under the
   conditions a firm is facing. This paper examines the determinants of
   range of supply chain integration. By comparing the SCI strategies of
   Korean and Japanese steel firms, the paper shows that SCI should be
   evaluated in light of supply chain flexibility and uncertainty.
   Additionally, it is argued that although SCI with customers helps
   diminish demand uncertainty, it can also bring inflexibility, which is a
   customer `lock-in' phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate and explain the
   factors contributing to supply chain agility in service-oriented firms
   and therein to enhance competitive capabilities of the organization. The
   study has identified various variables from past studies that support
   firms in developing agile supply chain operations. Factors identified
   from prior studies are supply chain flexibility, supply chain
   visibility, supply chain responsiveness, supply chain speed and learning
   orientation, which were then empirically tested for further
   understanding.
   Design/methodology/approach Using purposive sampling, a sample of 217
   valid responses was gathered through structured questionnaire from
   supply chain practitioners working in various service industries of
   Pakistan. Partial least square-structural equation modeling was used for
   data analysis.
   Findings The results of the study show that learning orientation and
   flexibility of the service firm highly complement the goal of achieving
   agility in their operations. Speed and visibility also have a major
   impact on developing agile supply chain. Moreover, supply chain agility
   has a significantly positive impact on competitive capabilities.
   Originality/value This research is about investigating the operational
   agility of services sector, which is a one-off study especially in the
   context of developing and competitive market. This research will provide
   important insights into the context of dynamic capabilities view for
   policymakers and decision-makers who aim to develop their competitive

Abstract = {The biorefinery concept offers a promising solution to transform the
   struggling forestry industry. Not only will the implementation of new
   products and processes help to diversify revenues, it will also offer an
   opportunity to change the manufacturing culture by better managing the
   flexibility of assets to react to volatile market conditions. In this
   paper, an integrated supply-chain planning framework is presented. It is
   based on optimizing a superstructure to help decision makers identify
   different supply-chain policies to adapt to different market conditions.
   It integrates revenue management concepts, activity-based cost
   accounting principles, manufacturing flexibility and supply-chain
   flexibility in a tactical model to maximize profit in a price-volatile
   environment. A case study of a newsprint mill implementing a parallel
   biomass fractionation line producing several biochemicals is used to
   illustrate this approach. Results and benefits are presented for the
   traditional pulp and paper business and for the transformed biorefinery
   in different market scenarios. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Exploiting embedded supply-chain real options creates powerful
   opportunities for competitive manufacturing in high-cost environments.
   Rather than seeking competitiveness through standardization as is common
   to lean production, real-options reasoning explores opportunities to use
   supply-chain variability as a strategic weapon. We present an
   illustrative case study of a Swiss manufacturer of cable extrusion
   equipment supported by a formal real-options model that aids in valuing
   the embedded options that make up supply-chain flexibility:
   postponement, contraction, expansion, switching, and abandonment.
   Real-options reasoning provides a plausible retrospective rationale for
   the case firm's use of supply-chain flexibility that provided protection
   against competition from low cost, but less responsive competitors.
   Their intuitive real-options reasoning facilitated incorporating fuller
   information concerning volatility, flexibility, and control into
   choosing what products to make, in what quantity, and with work
   allocated to which supplier. The case study also highlights how
   competing through exploiting embedded real options requires a different
   managerial skill set than does competing through cost reduction. Skills
   such as customer communication, supplier management, and ability to
   ensure a smooth flow of production join the ability to reduce and
   control lead times as key sources of competitive advantage.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, rapid changes in customers' demands have redoubled the
   importance of new concepts such as supply chain flexibility and its

   chains requires full consideration. Flexibility is defined as firms'
   quick and efficient response to changes. This paper quantifies the
   positive effects of adding different flexibility dimensions to a
   production planning bi-objective mathematical model. Four flexibility
   dimensions are proposed according to the needs of a production plant
   chosen as the case study. The objective functions are to minimize total
   costs along with the delivery time of the product, respectively. We also
   employ two metaheuristic algorithms, NSGA-II and MOPSO, to solve our
   proposed NP-hard model. Afterwards, we compare both solution strategies
   based on five criteria to achieve optimal results. Moreover, we compare
   the performance of both flexible and inflexible models in terms of
   costs. The results show that applying the flexible model causes a
   reduction of \%22 in costs.},

   supply chain: updated information on price behaviour, dynamic pricing
   and supply flexibility. And we demonstrate the effect of holding cost
   and demand uncertainty on these three values. We also consider a

Abstract = {This paper is intended to explore a new method of measuring supply chain
   flexibility from two dimensions (resources and time) when the supply
   chain is coordinated. Under the assumptions that the node enterprises'
   marginal costs increase with their outputs, firstly this paper analyses
   the coordination problem of a supply chain with buyback contract, then
   formulates the resource allocation with the entropy concept in the case
   of supply chain coordination, puts forward the concepts of resource
   output elasticity and time output elasticity, analyses the resources'
   dynamic matching problem from the two dimensions of resource and time in
   order to respond to the change of market demand. Finally, based on the
   above discussion, this paper proposes a method of measuring supply chain
   flexibility by integrating the resource flexibility and time
   flexibility. The method not only considers the resources and time
   required to respond the market's change, but also takes into account the
   coordination relationship between the node enterprises.},

Title = {Equilibrium Model of Discrete Dynamic Supply Chain Network with Random
   Demand and Advertisement Strategy},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {The advertisement can increase the consumers demand; therefore it is one
   of the most important marketing strategies in the operations management
   of enterprises. This paper aims to analyze the impact of advertising
   investment on a discrete dynamic supply chain network which consists of
   suppliers, manufactures, retailers, and demand markets associated at
   different tiers under random demand. The impact of advertising
   investment will last several planning periods besides the current period
   due to delay effect. Based on noncooperative game theory, variational
   inequality, and Lagrange dual theory, the optimal economic behaviors of
   the suppliers, the manufactures, the retailers, and the consumers in the
   demand markets are modeled. In turn, the supply chain network
   equilibrium model is proposed and computed by modified project
   contraction algorithm with fixed step. The effectiveness of the model is
   illustrated by numerical examples, and managerial insights are obtained
   through the analysis of advertising investment in multiple periods and
   advertising delay effect among different periods.},

Title = {Exploring relationships among IT-enabled sharing capability, supply
   chain flexibility, and competitive performance},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {24-34},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This research explores the mechanism through which IT infrastructure
   enables superior firm performance by empirically examining the links
   among IT-enabled sharing capability, supply chain flexibilities (as
   measured by a manufacturing firm's product development flexibility,
   production flexibility, logistics flexibility, suppliers' flexibility,
   and the flexibility of the supply base), and competitive performance.
   This study expands the research on IT's impact on competitive
   performance by focusing on IT-enabled sharing capability and the
   indirect effect of this capability on firm performance. Most prior
   research focused on the technical aspects of IT infrastructure and
   tested direct relationships.
   In this research, a large-scale survey was used to collect 198 responses
   from U.S. manufacturers to investigate this framework. Structural
   Equation Modeling was used to examine and test the measurement and
   structural models. The results indicated that IT-enabled sharing
   capability is associated with flexibilities in a manufacturer's supply
   chain, which in turn are associated with the firm's competitive
   performance. This finding suggests that a firm should focus on
   flexibilities in the supply chain to improve its performance. IT-enabled
   sharing capability is an antecedent for improving these flexibilities.
   Longitudinal research, multiple respondents, and techniques for
   improving response rate should be considered in future research to
   provide more robust results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The 3D printing order: variability, supercenters and supply chain
   reconfigurations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION \& LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {82-94},
Abstract = {Purpose - Direct digital manufacturing (DDM) is conceived of as either
   disrupting the entire manufacturing economy or merely enabling novel
   production. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an alternative
   where DDM coexists with and complements traditional mass production.
   When multiple parts run across one manufacturing line, DDM can isolate
   variability associated with low volume part production and may be
   preferred to mass production despite being expensive. If DDM complements
   rather than cannibalizes mass production, this alters the understanding
   of who adopts DDM, the products built with DDM, and DDM's long-term
   supply chain implications.
   Design/methodology/approach - This invited paper explores a DDM rollout
   scenario and qualitatively assesses potential supply chain
   reconfigurations.
   Findings - The analysis recognizes that existing manufacturers with
   heterogeneous bills-of-material may develop DDM capabilities to isolate
   disruptive, low-volume production from scalable mass production.
   Developing DDM competence and raw material scale advantages, these
   manufacturers become the locus of change in a manufacturing landscape
   increasingly characterized by multi-product DDM supercenters.
   Originality/value - Extant research largely focusses on two potential
   reasons for DDM adoption: cost-per-unit and time-to-delivery
   comparisons. The authors explore a third driver: DDM's capacity to
   isolate manufacturing variability attributable to low volume parts.
   Relative to the extant literature, this suggests a different DDM
   rollout, different adopters, and a different supply chain configuration.
   The authors identify mass manufacturing variability reduction as the
   mechanism through which DDM may be adopted. This adoption trajectory
   would eventually enable a supply chain transition in which spare parts
   inventory migrates from finished goods at proprietary facilities to raw
   materials at generalized DDM supercenters.},

Abstract = {Balancing sustainability and disruption of supply chains requires
   organizational ambidexterity. Sustainable supply chains prioritize
   efficiency and economies of scale and may not have sufficient redundancy
   to withstand disruptive events. There is a developing body of literature
   that attempts to reconcile these two aspects. This study gives a
   data-driven literature review of sustainable supply chain management
   trends toward ambidexterity and disruption. The critical review reveals
   temporal trends and geographic distribution of literature. A hybrid of
   data-driven analysis approach based on content and bibliometric
   analyses, fuzzy Delphi method, entropy weight method, and fuzzy
   decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is used on 273 keywords
   and 22 indicators obtained based on the experts' evaluation. The most
   important indicators are identified as supply chain agility, supply
   chain coordination, supply chain finance, supply chain flexibility,
   supply chain resilience, and sustainability. The regions show different
   tendencies compared with others. Asia and Oceania, Latin America and the
   Caribbean, and Africa are the regions needs improvement, while Europe
   and North America show distinct apprehensions on supply chain network
   design. The main contribution of this review is the identification of
   the knowledge frontier, which then leads to a discussion of prospects
   for future studies and practical industry implementation. (C) 2020

Title = {The impact of ambidexterity on supply chain flexibility fit},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {433-452},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether supply chain
   (SC) ambidexterity improves supply chain flexibility (SCF) and its
   impact on SC competence and firm performance. A new measurement
   instrument for SCF is proposed that takes into account the demands of
   the environment: SCF fit.
   Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical model is developed to
   examine the relationships proposed. The hypotheses are tested with data
   from 302 manufacturing firms using a structural equations model
   methodology.
   Findings - The results show that SC ambidexterity helps to achieve the
   optimal level of SCF and that supply chain management (SCM) is important
   to firm performance.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper makes three contributions
   to the SCM literature: first, it develops the conceptual definition of
   SC ambidexterity and studies its effects at the SC level; second, it
   develops a new instrument to measure SCF known as SCF fit; third, it
   studies both the impact of SCF fit on SC competence and the importance
   of SC in firm performance.
   Practical implications - This paper develops a measurement instrument
   that permits managers to diagnose the level of SCF and the
   correspondence/gap between current and optimal levels and to establish
   comparisons between different SC. It also indicates the importance of
   SCM for firm performance and the need to consider the SC as a whole.
   Originality/value - This is one of the first studies to analyze
   ambidexterity in an organizational network like the SC. It shows that
   exploitation practices do not jeopardize SCF as long as they are
   accompanied by exploration practices. That is, high levels of
   exploration and exploitation are compatible in the SC and lead to the
   optimal level of SCF.},

Title = {Emission reduction cooperation in a dynamic supply chain with
   competitive retailers},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Abstract = {The increasing carbon emissions cause severe environmental issues that
   threaten the survival of human beings. Such a situation promotes supply
   chain firms and governments to take various measures to achieve the
   sustainable goal. This paper investigates the cost-sharing cooperation
   strategy of emission reductions in a dynamic supply chain consisting of
   a manufacturer and two distinct retailers with different scales. In the
   presence of carbon tax and green reputation, we model a Stackelberg
   differential game to derive and compare the optimal equilibrium
   decisions and further conduct a numerical study to analyze the chain
   members' profits between the cases of no cost sharing and cost sharing.
   The manufacturer can actualize this sharing, respectively, with either
   of the competitive retailers. The results show that cost sharing is a
   better choice for supply chain members than no sharing. In the
   cost-sharing scenario, the manufacturer and two retailers prefer the
   case in which the emission reduction cost that a retailer undertakes is
   relatively high, because the manufacturer can increase emission
   reduction level to build its green reputation, and thereby the retailers
   can improve profits. When the proportion of emission reduction cost that
   a retailer undertakes locates in a certain interval, all the supply
   chain participants can be better off in the scenario where small-scale
   retailer shares the emission reduction cost. In addition, the increase
   in carbon tax improves the flexibility of cost-sharing ratio for the
   members achieving this consensual scenario on the cost-sharing
   cooperation.},

Abstract = {The combination of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and
   dynamic capabilities theory is a fairly young topic, which has attracted
   great attention from scholars and practitioners recently. This study
   empirically investigates the impact of SSCM practices on supply chain
   (SC) dynamic capabilities and enterprise performance (including
   economic, environmental and social performance) by explicitly focusing
   on the mediation effect of SC dynamic capabilities on the link between
   SSCM practices and enterprise performance. Data collected from 209
   Chinese manufacturing firms were analyzed using structural equation
   modeling. The results reveal that SSCM practices have a significant
   positive effect on SC dynamic capabilities and all three dimensions of
   performances. Whereas SC dynamic capabilities affect only environmental
   performance positively, they have no effect on economic performance and
   social performance. Furthermore our analysis reveals that SC dynamic
   capabilities partially mediate the relationship between SSCM practices
   and enterprise performance. Overall, the findings explicate the
   importance for firms, in particular those operating in developing
   countries, to reinforce their SC dynamic capabilities and implement
   effective SSCM practices as an enabler. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Purpose The paper investigates firms' optimal pricing policies and green
   strategies in a dynamic green supply chain with consideration of
   different retail service strategies. The purpose of the paper is to
   address the following research questions: (1) What are the optimal
   pricing policies and green strategies of the dynamic decentralized
   supply chain with the competitive or supportive retail service? (2) How
   does the dynamic consumer's perception of green product affect these
   equilibrium solutions? Design/methodology/approach The paper establishes
   the dynamic game models and then derives a firm's instantaneous and
   steady-state feedback equilibrium solutions in three scenarios as
   follows: (1) the integrated supply chain; (2) the decentralized supply
   chain with competitive retail service and (3) the decentralized supply
   chain with supportive retail service. Finally, we conduct numerical
   analyses to compare the firm's instantaneous and steady-state
   equilibrium solutions and profit in the three scenarios. Findings The
   theoretical and numerical analysis results suggest that the supportive
   retail service is less inefficient than the competitive retail service
   in the decentralized supply chain and that the types of retail service
   have no influence on the green strategy. Moreover, a firm's myopia leads
   to lowering the greenness degree, retail service level and severe price
   competition, resulting in economic losses. Consumers' initial perception
   of greenness degree determines whether the retailer should adopt the
   skimming pricing strategy or penetration pricing strategy. Furthermore,
   only when consumers' perception of greenness degree is higher than a
   threshold, will the manufacturer produce green product with positive
   greenness degree. Originality/value This is one of few studies on the
   effect of different types of retail service on horizontal competition in
   green supply chain. The extension of the static study by adopting
   differential game approaches provides researchers with a deeper
   understanding of the application of retail service in green supply
   chain.},

Abstract = {A key decision in design of a supply chain is the configuration of the
   network. In this study, supply chain network design problem is
   investigated and an efficient solution approach is presented.
   Specifically, a heuristic graph theoretic-based algorithm is proposed
   for solving a multi-echelon responsive supply chain network design
   problem with lateral-transshipment among retailers. The possibility of
   lateral-transshipment is considered to increase the customer
   satisfaction by increasing the availability of the goods, and to reduce
   total inventory handling costs. Consideration of lateral transshipment
   provides a trade-off between transportation costs and inventory handling
   costs at the retailers. Graph theory is used to investigate and study
   the structure of the supply chain network and it is shown that the
   network can be reduced to a k-partite graph. The performance of the
   proposed approach is compared with an exact commercial solver on test
   problems. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm generates
   high-quality solutions in a reasonable time in comparison with the exact
   solver.},

Title = {Strategic Information Sharing in a Dynamic Supply Chain with a Carrier
   under Complex Uncertainty},
Journal = {DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {Whether to use an information sharing mechanism is investigated in a
   dynamic supply chain, where one manufacturer, one carrier, and one
   retailer are faced with uncertain yield, demand, and lead time during
   multiple periods. Each member is modeled as an adaptive agent based on
   multiagent technique, and their decisions can be adjusted timely to
   adapt to external environment. There are two choices for the whole
   supply chain to deal with uncertain risks: information sharing (IS) or
   no information sharing (NS). Under strategy IS, the information about
   market demand and the retailer's inventory can be shared within the
   supply chain. For each strategy, the effects of yield, demand, and lead
   time uncertainties on costs of the supply chain and channel members are
   studied. It is found that (i) it is rewarding for the upstream
   manufacturer to use a retailer's shared information under uncertain
   yield or demand; (ii) however, information sharing (IS) strategy
   sometimes should be abandoned for other members and the whole supply
   chain; (iii) counterintuitively, the increase of transportation time
   uncertainty benefits the retailer.},

   Manufacturing Supply Chain},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {There is an increasing need for supply chains that can rapidly respond
   to fluctuating demands and can provide customised products. This supply
   chain design requires the development of flexibility as a critical
   capability. To this end, firms are considering Additive Manufacturing
   (AM) as one strategic option that could enable such a capability. This
   paper develops a conceptual model that maps AM characteristics relevant
   to flexibility against key market disruption scenarios. Following the
   development of this model, a case study is undertaken to indicate the
   impact of adopting AM on supply chain flexibility from four major
   flexibility-related aspects: volume, mix, delivery, and new product
   introduction. An inter-process comparison is implemented in this case
   study using data collected from a manufacturing company that produces
   pipe fittings using Injection Moulding (IM). The supply chain employing
   IM in this case study shows greater volume and delivery flexibility
   levels (i.e., 65.68\% and 92.8\% for IM compared to 58.70\% and 75.35\%
   for AM, respectively) while the AM supply chain shows greater mix and
   new product introduction flexibility, indicated by the lower changeover
   time and cost of new product introduction to the system (i.e., 0.33 h
   and euro0 for AM compared to 4.91 h and euro30,000 for IM,
   respectively). This work will allow decision-makers to take timely
   decisions by providing useful information on the effect of AM adoption
   on supply chain flexibility in different sudden disruption scenarios
   such as demand uncertainty, demand variability, lead-time compression
   and product variety.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article investigates the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and their
   proactive mediation by adaptive operational decisions in different
   network design structures in anticipation of and during the pandemic. In
   generalized terms, we contribute to the understanding of the effect of
   preparedness and recovery decisions in a pandemic setting on supply
   chain operations and performance. In particular, we examine the impact
   of inventory pre-positioning in anticipation of a pandemic and the
   adaptation of production-ordering policy during the pandemic. Our model
   combines three levels, which is not often seen jointly in operations
   management literature, i.e., pandemic dynamics, supply chain design, and
   operational production-inventory control policies. The analysis is
   performed for both two-and three-stage supply chains and different
   scenarios for pandemic dynamics (i.e., uncontrolled propagation or
   controlled dispersal with lockdowns). Our findings suggest that
   two-stage supply chains exhibit a higher vulnerability in disruption
   cases. However, they are exposed to a lower system inertia and show
   positive effects at the recovery stage. Supply chain adaptation ahead of
   a pandemic is more advantageous than during the pandemic when specific
   operational recovery policies are deployed. We show that it is
   instructive to avoid simultaneous changes in structural network design
   and operational policies since that can destabilize the
   production-inventory system and result in higher product shortages.(c)

Abstract = {The public's increasing concern for carbon emissions promotes supply

   equilibrium pricing and emission reduction solutions are compared
   between integrated and decentralized channel settings. A two-part tariff
   contract is further proposed to improve channel performance. The
   numerical analysis illustrates that the emission reduction level, green
   reputation, demand, and entire profit of the supply chain are larger in
   the integrated setting than the counterparts in the decentralized
   setting. However, the relationship between the two channels in terms of
   retail price depends on unit carbon tax. In addition, the two-part

Abstract = {We investigate the process innovation and contracting decisions of a
   dynamic supply chain consisting of a supplier and a manufacturer, with
   the manufacturer possessing private information about her efficiency of
   process innovation. To overcome the potential adverse selection problem
   due to the asymmetric infor-mation, the supplier designs a menu of
   supply contracts that stipulates both the wholesale price and the
   purchasing quantity. We find that under information asymmetry, the
   supplier will optimally set a higher wholesale price but a lower
   purchasing quantity for the manufacturer with high innovation efficiency
   than that for the manufacturer with low innovation efficiency. As a
   consequence, the manufacturer with high innovation efficiency will
   significantly underinvest in innovation due to information asymmetry in
   addition to the impact of the double marginalization effect. Moreover,
   although a longer contract period tends to better motivate innovation,
   it can also magnify the influences of adverse selection on supply chain
   contracting, leading to a higher wholesale price for the manufacturer
   with high innovation effi-ciency. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Pages = {1970-1988},

Abstract = {The frequency and intensity of disasters continue to increase. Following
   large-scale and catastrophic disasters, local organisations integrate
   with other responding organisations to form hastily disaster relief
   supply chain networks. Such supply networks are infrequently activated
   in a single location, generate unparalleled uncertainty, change quickly,
   and are driven by the urgency of saving lives and restoring livelihoods.
   Unfortunately, even where sound supply chain management practices are
   used, supply networks have encountered diverse levels of resilience and
   adequate disaster relief performance has remained elusive. In this
   paper, several unique characteristics that disaster relief efforts
   exhibit are examined as compared with demand-driven, steady-state supply
   chains. Important differences in the flows of resource, money, and
   information are identified. A complex adaptive supply network (CASN)
   lens is used to frame what existing literature has uncovered regarding
   disaster relief efforts, showing how relief organisations, their
   interactions, and their environmental context help determine the level
   of resilience that supply networks experience following disasters. This
   CASN characterisation is leveraged to help explain why traditional
   supply chain management practices lead to varied results in disaster
   relief. Finally, complexity science theory is drawn on to set forth
   eight testable propositions that may help to enhance supply network
   resilience.},

Title = {SME supply chain portfolios: firm satisfaction and organization
   resources},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {271-300},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this research is to investigate the combination
   of relational and organizational resource factors that influence
   small-to-medium-sized firm satisfaction with their supply chain
   portfolio performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research employs two complementary
   theoretical lenses frequently used in the explanation of relationship
   performance, resource-based view of the firm and strategic behavior
   theory. The authors then used an international survey based in three
   Northern European countries to test their hypotheses with hierarchical
   linear regression.
   Findings - The quantitative analysis supports all three hypotheses
   indicating that supply chain portfolio flexibility is an important
   determinant for small-to-medium-sized firm satisfaction with supply
   chain portfolio performance. Additionally, firm alliance orientation and
   entrepreneurial orientation both significantly influence the
   relationship between supply chain flexibility and performance
   satisfaction.
   Research limitations/implications - This research is limited by the
   categorization of the supply chain portfolio flexibility types as high
   and low resource linkages by the researchers. Future research may look
   at additional ways to measure individual agreements and have firms
   categorize them according to resource requirements. However, the
   findings of this research provide a theoretical and empirical foundation
   through the application of resource-based view of the firm and strategic
   behavior theory for future research in the area of small-to-medium-sized
   firms and their satisfaction with supply chain portfolios.
   Practical implications - Important managerial implications are found for
   small to medium-sized firms and larger firms that work with them when
   managing portfolio satisfaction. This research indicates that it makes
   sense for managers to consider categorizing supply chain relationships
   similar to the way they categorize their end-user relationships. This
   allows small-to-medium-sized firms across the portfolio to be segmented
   into groups where appropriate relationship maintenance can take place
   and where more suitable satisfaction goals can be defined in terms of
   operational metrics.
   Originality/value - The framework developed in this paper provides
   insights on small-to-medium-sized firm satisfaction with supply chain
   portfolio performance. This research stimulates a new research stream
   towards an integrated theory of supply chain portfolio management.},

   propose a theory for how implementing digitalization in the form of
   blockchain technology (BCT) can improve the efficiency and effectiveness
   of maritime supply chains.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This conceptual paper is grounded in dynamic capabilities, supply-chain
   management and digital supply-chain theories. Relevant literature is
   scrutinized to explain how BCT can improve supply-chain performance.
   Findings
   BCT mainly benefits supply-chain performance through the development of
   intangible capabilities, by leveraging the capabilities (resources) that
   maritime supply chains provide.
   Practical implications
   Investments in digitalization improve the overall information sharing,
   coordination and visibility capabilities and performances of supply
   chains.
   Originality/value
   Although literature on BCT is extensive, this framework paper is the
   first to link BCT with dynamics capabilities and maritime supply-chain
   theory and will serve as a road map for future research and practice.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this research is to investigate the impact of
   manufacturing flexibility and technological dimensions of manufacturing
   strategy on responsiveness in the supply chain. Based on the theoretical
   background of dynamic capability, this study also examines the role of
   the business environment on the relationship between manufacturing
   flexibility and supply chain responsiveness. 144 structured surveys were
   collected and the partial least squares of structural equation modelling
   approach were utilised for data analysis. The result establishes
   relationships among various dimensions of manufacturing flexibility.
   Although the technological dimensions in manufacturing strategy of such
   advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) and e-procurement do not have
   any direct impact on new product and market flexibility, they increase
   supply chain responsiveness, which helps to react quickly against supply
   chain disruptions. More importantly, the business environment has a
   moderating effect on the relationship between market flexibility and
   supply chain responsiveness.},

Abstract = {There is growing interest among researchers in the concept of
   sustainability. Large commercial corporations have also shown
   responsibility for preserving planet and people while maintaining
   profit. Our present paper is motivated by the three P's-people, planet,
   and profit. In our paper, we have attempted to develop a responsive
   sustainable supply chain network which can respond to a certain degree
   of uncertainty due to uncontrollable forces. We have developed a model
   using robust optimization based on three well-known robust counterpart
   optimization formulations. Finally, this paper compares the results of
   the three formulations using different test scenarios and
   parameter-sensitive analysis in terms of final output, CPU time, the
   level of conservatism, the degree of closeness to the ideal solution,
   the degree of balance involved in developing a compromise solution, and
   satisfaction degree. Two further questions related to environmental
   dimensions and social dimensions have been investigated using an
   appreciative inquiry, a quasi-ethnographic study. In this way, we have
   embraced mixed research design to address our research questions. We
   have extended past research by incorporating uncertainty in a mixed
   integer linear programming (MILP) model and qualitative research methods

Abstract = {Maritime port infrastructures rely on the use of information systems for
   collaboration, while a vital part of collaborating is to provide
   protection to these systems. Attack graph analysis and risk assessment
   provide information that can be used to protect the assets of a network
   from cyber-attacks. Furthermore, attack graphs provide functionality
   that can be used to identify vulnerabilities in a network and how these
   can be exploited by potential attackers. Existing attack graph
   generation methods are inadequate in satisfying certain requirements
   necessary in a dynamic supply chain risk management environment, since
   they do not consider variables that assist in exploring specific network
   parts that satisfy certain criteria, such as the entry and target
   points, the propagation length and the location and capability of the
   potential attacker. In this paper, we present a cyber-attack path
   discovery method that is used as a component of a maritime risk
   management system. The method uses constraints and Depth-first search to
   effectively generate attack graphs that the administrator is interested
   in. To support our method and to show its effectiveness we have
   evaluated it using real data from a maritime supply chain. (c) 2017 The

   performance: an empirical analysis for manufacturing firms in Turkey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {1224-1244},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {Purpose In spite of its potential benefits in a wide range of
   situations, supply chain risk mitigation strategies have received scant
   attention on the subject of managing the supply chain risk in the
   business environment. Especially, there is still a limited understanding
   of the importance of firms' supply chain flexibility, resilience and
   responsiveness in the supply chain risk management (SCRM) literature.
   This research focuses on exploring the relationship between significant
   proactive risk mitigation strategies, namely supply chain (SC)
   flexibility, resilience and responsiveness, as well as SCRM performance
   to facilitate bridging the gap between mitigation strategies and SCRM
   performance. The moderating role of risk management (RM) culture was
   also hypothesized and tested. Design/methodology/approach A survey-based
   methodology is adopted. The data are analyzed using the technique of
   partial least squares. Findings The results indicate that SC resilience
   and responsiveness are positively associated with SCRM performance;
   however, SC flexibility does not. In addition, interestingly, RM culture
   does not moderate these relationships in spite of the extant literature.
   We argue that this could be due to the fact that risk management culture
   is at the beginning stage for an enterprise in Turkey. Originality/value
   This study extends the existing literature by advancing the knowledge on
   the relationship between proactive risk management strategies, which
   applied to overcome uncertainties and SCRM performance.},

Volume = {39},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Purpose This study investigates the level of variance in the real time
   demand for bagged cement, induced in response to the climatic sequence
   of the humid tropics, to support best practice calls for a
   weather-responsive supply chain strategy. Design/methodology/approach
   Data on the consumption of cement and site works for 100 ongoing
   building construction sites were gathered for a period of 12 months. The
   variance partitioning capabilities of the Ordinary Least Squares and
   Hierarchical Linear Modelling forms of regression analysis are
   comparatively used to evaluate the sensitivity of cement demand to the
   meteorological profile of wet-humid climate Findings The study outcome
   provides statistical evidence demonstrating that the meteorological
   profile of wet-humid climate induces a significantly high percentage of
   the variance in the real-time demand for bagged cement on construction
   sites. However, nested within this variance, are the fixed effects of
   the cement footprint of the building architecture inherent in the
   locality. Particularly, positive changes to reduce the wet trade
   composition of buildings or compensating changes in technological bias,
   are necessary to combat weather interference in the humid tropics.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings are exploratory, and
   not for the purposes of holistically forecasting cement demand, and can
   therefore only form part of a more comprehensive decision support
   system, bespoke to the study area.
   Practical implications - The study outcome provides a back-end view to
   climatic adaptation in wet humid settings, making a compelling case for
   localized climate-risk adaptive supply chain strategies and policies
   geared towards sustainability in cement usage.
   Originality/value The study delineates the confounding impact of
   weather, distinct from local building architecture and technological
   bias, thus creating a methodological platform for replication and
   comparative productivity studies in diverse geographical areas.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is the allocation of orders to suppliers
   in an agile and flexible manner suitable to the automobile industry. In
   this paper, parts supplied by a single source were eliminated from the
   set of parts. Using mathematical modeling and through the
   interval-valued fuzzy-rough numbers best worst method (IVFRN-BWM), we
   try to achieve the results that can meet the proposed model's needs and
   provide the ideal results by introducing new modes. This paper addressed
   some new aspects of the subject and achieved robust results by
   considering five objective functions. These five functions are as
   follows: minimization of production line disruptions due to the
   performance of suppliers, minimization of the complaints of production
   line about supplied parts, minimization of defective parts received from
   suppliers (PPM), maximization of on-time delivery services, and
   minimization of overall costs of supplied parts. Reviewing the
   literature, the originality of this study are as follows: 1) identifying
   the structure of a supply chain (SC) in general and particularly in an
   automobile industry SC; 2) investigating the modeling techniques of the
   existing SC models for coordinating all the members of a product SC; 3)
   building a hybrid model of IVFRN-BWM and a robust goal programming agile

   the suitable scenarios/cases for testing the proposed models to validate
   the models. This paper can help decision makers and managers to opt for
   the best suppliers and also allocate the right numbers of parts to those

Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Supply networks existing today in many industries can behave as complex
   adaptive systems making them more difficult to analyze and assess. Being
   able to fully understand both the complex static and dynamic structures
   of a complex adaptive supply network (CASN) are key to being able to
   make more informed management decisions and prioritize resources and
   production throughout the network. Previous efforts to model and analyze
   CASN have been impeded by the complex, dynamic nature of the systems.
   However, drawing from other complex adaptive systems sciences,
   information theory provides a model-free methodology removing many of
   those barriers, especially concerning complex network structure and
   dynamics. With minimal information about the network nodes, transfer
   entropy can be used to reverse engineer the network structure while
   local transfer entropy can be used to analyze the network structure's
   dynamics. Both simulated and real-world networks were analyzed using
   this methodology. Applying the methodology to CASNs allows the
   practitioner to capitalize on observations from the highly
   multidisciplinary field of information theory which provides insights
   into CASN's self-organization, emergence, stability/instability, and
   distributed computation. This not only provides managers with a more
   thorough understanding of a system's structure and dynamics for
   management purposes, but also opens up research opportunities into
   eventual strategies to monitor and manage emergence and adaption within
   the environment.},

Title = {Backup or Reliability Improvement Strategy for a Manufacturer Facing
   Heterogeneous Consumers in a Dynamic Supply Chain},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {50419-50430},
Abstract = {This paper examines a manufacturer's supply management strategies for
   mitigating yield risk in a complex dynamic supply chain. Two strategies
   can be adopted for the manufacturer: backup and reliability improvement.
   Consumers may select to leave (instant consumers) or wait (delaying
   consumers) when they confront the manufacturer's insufficient inventory.
   Utilizing the method of multi-agent modeling, a manufacturer and a
   supplier are modeled as the intelligent agents with the reinforcement
   learning behavior. The study shows that: 1) when the number of instant
   consumers is small, reliability improvement strategy should be selected;
   otherwise, the manufacturer should adopt a backup strategy; 2) only when
   mean yield is large enough, reliability improvement strategy is the
   optimal choice; and 3) if yield uncertainty is small, the manufacturer
   should choose reliability improvement strategy; otherwise, it is
   suitable to use a backup strategy. In addition, when the main supplier
   can determine its own wholesale price, it is found that: 1) when the
   mean yield is small, a lower wholesale price should be designed for the
   main supplier, to induce higher order quantity under backup strategy;
   and 2) the impact of yield uncertainty on the manufacturer's supply
   management strategy can be changed by the main supplier's adaptive
   pricing behavior.},

Title = {Forming post-COVID supply chains: does supply chain managers' social
   network affect resilience?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION \& LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Purpose - Rethinking how to build resilience in supply chains is once
   again highlighted by COVID-19. Research on supply chain resilience has
   established flexibility as a firm-level antecedent that contributes to
   supply chain resilience. However, the authors know little about how
   supply chain flexibility is developed within a firm. Drawing on social
   capital theory, the authors claim that the way supply chain managers are
   embedded in their social networks plays a critical role in developing
   this antecedent. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that supply chain
   managers' structural and relational embeddedness in their reference
   network, comprised of individuals from whom they seek advice, is
   instrumental to developing supply chain flexibility, which subsequently
   enhances the firm's supply chain resilience.
   Design/methodology/approach - Survey data collected from 485
   manufacturing firms in Australia and Hayes and Preacher's (2014)
   parallel multiple mediator model were employed to empirically test the
   hypotheses.
   Findings - The findings of the study establish that supply chain
   managers' structural and relational embeddedness in their reference
   network indeed have implications for developing supply chain resilience.
   Furthermore, the mediator through which managers' social embeddedness
   influences supply chain resilience is identified in the current study.
   Originality/value - The study contributes to the extant literature on
   supply chain resilience, investigating the role that supply chain
   managers' social capital play in developing the resilience of their
   firm.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the application of diverse transportation modes
   for a global supply chain (SC) in stochastic environments. The
   motivation of our paper is to investigate the idea of enabling a global
   flexible SC with disruptive risks in making it less vulnerable by
   applying diverse transportation modes which is also our first
   contribution. The flexibility stems from the fact that transportation
   modes with a low-speed transportation contain latent time buffers that
   can be used by accelerating transport activities. This represents a
   promising approach to make supply chains (SCs) more flexible and to
   establish an additional degree of freedom in order to manage stochastic
   events like minor disruptions or serious catastrophes. In this paper, a
   stochastic Programming model for a multi-stage multi-product SC is
   developed. SC partners, including multiple suppliers, a processing
   center, two assembling centers, multiple distribution centers and
   retailers, are incorporated into the model. The second contribution of
   this paper is that different types of possible future catastrophic
   disruptions are quantified and included in the model. SC catastrophic
   disruptions like transportation delays or the fact that a SC node is
   disrupted by a serious catastrophe are stochastic factors of our model.
   The model is solved by using PySP, a specific modeling and stochastic
   programming framework. In order to show the quality of solutions of the
   stochastic programming model (SP solutions), a large amount of scenarios
   is generated to simulate the real case for each instance. The ekpected
   SC costs for these scenarios will be evaluated based on SP solutions and
   wait-and-see solutions, which are benchmarks. In addition, decision
   makers with neutral, optimistic and pessimistic attitudes regarding the
   occurrence of disruptions are also simulated and evaluated in the
   computational experiments. Managerial insights are concluded from
   computational results. The most important conclusion is that proper
   transportation mode planning enables a flexible global supply chain.
   Further conclusions like the quality of stochastic solutions and
   solutions of simulating decision makers with neutral, optimistic and
   pessimistic attitudes, as well as the most beneficial transportation
   modes in SCs with uncertain environments are proposed based on the
   computational results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, supply chain management (SCM) has become one of the focal
   points of competition. The importance of information sharing in SCM is
   gradually increasing in terms of improving the business performance. In
   this study, an attempt to determine the effect of information sharing in
   the supply chain process (SCP) on cost, financial and business
   performance, in general, was made. The attempt was made by means of a
   measuring tool which is based on a theoretical approach. For this
   purpose, the structural equation model (SEM) was established by taking
   into account the supply chain structure, SCP, supply chain flexibility,
   environmental uncertainties and information sharing latent structures in
   businesses and the cost and financial performance indicators. In this
   study, differently from most other studies, two performance variables
   were included, and the model was created by defining these variables,
   which could be measured with more than one indicator, as latent
   variables. For this purpose, the data obtained from a questionnaire
   study performed on large firms within the scope of ISO 1000 were used.
   An attempt to reveal the factors affecting the cost and financial
   performance of businesses in SCM was made in the study. As a result of
   the analyses performed, the proposed SEM model was tested by taking into
   account various compliance criteria, and the validity and reliability of
   the model were determined.},

   from a failure of vision rather than a market failure in the traditional
   sense. We present a model of supply chain flexibility, grounded in real

Abstract = {Supply chain flexibility is widely recognized as an approach to manage
   uncertainty. Uncertainty in the supply chain may arise from a number of
   sources such as demand and supply interruptions and lead time
   variability. A tactical supply chain planning model with multiple

   adjustment in an existing supply chain. This paper develops such a
   tactical supply chain planning model incorporating a realistic range of

   developed mixed integer nonlinear programming model. The utility of the
   proposed model and solution method is evaluated using data from an

Abstract = {Decisions in supply chain planning and control are interconnected and
   depend on tackling uncertainties and dynamics. From this perspective,
   control theory (CT) is an interesting research avenue for the supply
   chain management (SCM). In this paper, the applicability of optimal CT
   to SCM is investigated. Our analysis is based on the fundamentals of
   control and systems theory and experimental modeling. The paper
   describes important issues and perspectives that delineate dynamics in
   supply chains, identifies and systemizes different streams in
   application of CT to production, logistics, and SCM in the period from
   1960 to 2011. It derives some classifications, performs a critical
   analysis, and discusses further researches. Some drawbacks and missing
   links in the literature are pointed out. Several crucial application
   areas of control theory to SCM are discussed. Subsequently, optimal
   program control, challenges and advantages of its application in the SCM
   are addressed. It is shown how optimal program control can be applied to
   adaptive supply chain planning. In addition, it is concluded that with
   the help of CT, robustness, adaptability, and resilience of supply
   chains can be investigated in their consistency with operations planning
   and execution control within a conceptually and mathematically
   integrated framework. However, although SCs resemble control systems,
   they have some peculiarities which do not allow a direct application of
   CT methods. In this setting, further development of interdisciplinary
   approaches to supply chain optimization is argued. An extended
   co-operation between control and supply chain experts may have the
   potential to introduce more realism to the dynamic planning and models
   and improve real-time supply chain control policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {Purpose - Firms within industrial clusters are subject to challenges
   such as globalization, limited resources, volatility of international
   markets and financial instabilities. 4th party logistics (4PL) service
   providers are supporting individual firms to overcome such challenges by
   using collaborative operational capabilities from within an industrial

   to focus on China and proposes a collaborative operational capabilities
   framework to illustrate the role of 4PL in industrial cluster
   competitiveness.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper follows an extensive literature
   review and structured interviews in two types of clusters, drawing on
   resource-based view and importance-performance matrix analysis.
   Findings - The paper proposes six elements (that is, synergy of

   and innovation ability, cooperation of companies and flexibility of
   supply chain) that comprise collaborative operational capabilities, and
   highlights the role of ``creativity and innovation ability{''} and
   ``supply chain flexibility{''} in the use of 4PL for industrial cluster
   competitiveness in Chinese context.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper focusses on China and
   hence it could also be tested in the developed countries' context with
   the support of large-scale empirical data to investigate further its
   usefulness and to identify other constraints.
   Originality/value - The study contributes to the 4PL literature in that
   it proposes a framework that extrapolates the importance of 4PL in

Title = {The development of a lean, agile and leagile supply network taxonomy
   based on differing types of flexibility},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {151},
Pages = {100-111},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The paper explores the meaning of flexibility in the context of lean,
   agile and leagile supply networks and articulates a supply network
   flexibility framework. Two key `sources' of flexibility are
   investigated: vendor flexibility and sourcing flexibility. The paper
   introduces an extension of the `leagility' concept beyond the simple
   material flow decoupling point concept. Two new types of leagility are
   put forward: (1) leagile with vendor flexibility systems, which combine
   the use of agile vendors with lean sourcing practices and (2) leagile
   with sourcing flexibility systems, which combine the use of lean vendors
   with agile sourcing practices. Case studies of two UK based specialist
   fashion retailers' supply networks are presented in order to gain
   insights into the sourcing strategies used and the sources of
   flexibility employed by retailers at supply network level. A new
   taxonomy that dynamically links vendor and sourcing flexibility with
   lean, agile and leagile supply network strategies is proposed. We
   suggest that the proposed taxonomy can be used as a guideline for firms
   designing and managing parallel supply pipelines that match different
   operating environments. The findings add to the understanding of the
   ways in which the two sources of supply network flexibility (vendor and
   sourcing) interact in practice and provide evidence of the ways in which
   companies can strike balances between these sources, as well as the
   effects that can be achieved and some of the trade-offs involved. (C)

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of dynamic supply chain (SC) recovery.
   We consider effectiveness and efficiency of various reactive measures to
   recover the SC with the minimum cost at the operational level. For this
   purpose, a new general model based on bounded optimal control theory is
   developed to determine the type, the extent, and the timing of reactive
   measures. We demonstrate its application using an example of a
   two-echelon poultry SC. The intention of the proposed model is to
   optimise both the recovery and its costs simultaneously. The developed
   model is solved exactly using the Pontryagin's maximum principle. We
   performed a set of sensitivity analyses to illustrate the model's
   behaviour. The results obtained from applying the dynamic recovery model
   in the case study show that the proposed model can help SC managers to
   deal with disruptions by comparing alternative recovery options, based
   on two important criteria of the time and cost of SC's recovery. The
   findings of this research advocate the consideration of dynamic SC
   characteristics and the need for simultaneous attention to the
   effectiveness and efficiency of reactive measures in recovery planning.},

Abstract = {Sourcing flexibility is an increasingly important building block of
   supply chain flexibility. Our study which is grounded in information
   processing theory argues that two mechanisms can support firms in
   building up sourcing flexibility. Based on a survey of 336 manufacturing
   firms from Europe and the U.S. and using partial least squares (PLS)
   modeling as well as hierarchical regression analysis, we show that
   supplier evaluation and selection, and the integration of information
   systems at the buyer-supplier interface are positively related to
   sourcing flexibility. Sourcing flexibility, in turn, is curvilinearly
   related to delivery performance. Finally, delivery performance
   positively influences the product's financial performance. The strong
   associations between sourcing flexibility, delivery performance, and
   product financial performance underscore that sourcing flexibility
   merits the attention of supply chain managers during supplier selection
   and purchasing decisions.},

Abstract = {In the competitive market of today, supply chain flexibility (SCF) plays
   crucial way to address various supply chain uncertainties. But, in
   diverse situations, the supply chain needs different types of
   flexibilities. This paper analyses the flexibility of an automobile
   supply chain under sales promotional schemes (SPS) to meet the demand
   uncertainty. Taking the opinion of supply chain experts from automobile
   original equipment manufacturers (OEM's), 14 SCF strategies have been
   identified and then using interpretive structural modelling (ISM) on the
   conducted survey, their interrelationships are established and a
   hierarchical model is developed. MICMAC analysis is done to classify the
   strategies into four categories viz. autonomous, dependent, linkage and
   independent strategies, which are based on their driving and dependence
   powers. Sensitivity analysis has been conducted to check the stability
   of the model. The thorough exposition of the model presents a handful of
   insights to supply chain managers to know the most important strategies
   affecting each other. The study helps in bridging the SCF with SPS, a
   huge gap existing in the literature.},

Abstract = {We address the dynamic design of supply chain networks in which the
   moments of demand distribution function are uncertain and facilities'
   availability is stochastic because of possible disruptions. To
   incorporate the existing stochasticity in our dynamic problem, we
   develop a multi-stage stochastic program to specify the optimal
   location, capacity, inventory, and allocation decisions. Further, a
   data-driven rolling horizon approach is developed to use observations of
   the random parameters in the stochastic optimization problem. In
   contrast to traditional stochastic programming approaches that are valid
   only for a limited number of scenarios, the rolling horizon approach
   makes the determined decisions by the stochastic program implementable
   in practice and evaluates them. The stochastic program is presented as a
   quadratic conic optimization, and to generate an efficient scenario
   tree, a forward scenario tree construction technique is employed. An
   extensive numerical study is carried out to investigate the
   applicability of the presented model and rolling horizon procedure, the
   efficiency of risk-measurement policies, and the performance of the
   scenario tree construction technique. Several key practical and
   managerial insights related to the dynamic supply chain network design
   under uncertainty are gained based on the computational results.},

Abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry faces multiple challenges (e.g., inefficient
   manufacturing techniques, quality control issues, and supply chain
   vulnerabilities) because of its current batch-wise approach to
   manufacturing. Recent regulatory support for continuous manufacturing
   and advances in continuous process technologies have caused an increase
   in interest from some drug manufacturers to modernize their production
   processes. However, many of these companies have focused on hybrid
   processes, where only certain steps are continuous, while others remain
   batch. Herein, the quality by design (QbD)-based design strategy and
   operation of an end-to-end integrated continuous manufacturing (ICM)
   pilot plant that produces both small-molecule active pharmaceutical
   ingredient (API) and oral solid dosages (OSDs) are discussed.
   Additionally, important quality and economic matters pertaining to
   scale-up and commercialization are addressed. ICM has significant
   benefits, including better quality control, increased supply chain
   flexibility, a lower capital investment (in the example provided, a
   similar to 90\% reduction), and lower operating costs (in the example
   provided, a 33.6\% reduction for API and 29.4\% reduction for tablets).},

Abstract = {A supply chain needs to meet its customers' requirements (CRs) in terms

   product design into logistic design. The effect of uncertain customer
   demand, production and supply lead times are studied. An optimum supply

   and tactical level. A system dynamic based computer simulation model is
   used to validate the operations of the supply chain. The performance of
   the system is measured in terms of backorders and inventory level. The
   results and analysis indicate that fewer stockholding points and a
   shorter review period of demand can improve performance in this respect.
   In addition, a proposal for improving the performance of supply chain in

Abstract = {To maintain competitiveness, businesses need to upgrade their
   operational performance and financial performance more efficiently and
   effectively in order to control uncertainty and costs. The purposes of
   the study are to (1) investigate the relationship between three
   dimensions, namely integration, flexibility, and performance; and (2)
   examine the mediating effects of supply chain flexibility. This research
   collected annual reports from the Indonesian basic and chemical industry
   from 2014 to 2017. Content analysis was used to extract information from
   companies' annual reports, and hierarchical analysis examined the
   hypotheses. The results show that external information integration
   positively influences both reactive and proactive flexibility.
   Furthermore, proactive flexibility significantly affects financial
   performance and operational performance. Moreover, both reactive and
   proactive flexibility have positive mediating effects on the connection
   between external information integration and operational performance.
   Lastly, reactive flexibility positively mediates external information
   integration's effect on financial performance. As the market has been
   becoming more competitive, this study provides important insights for
   decision-makers. This study contributes to the knowledge of the
   Indonesian basic and chemical supply chain by considering both financial
   and operational performance, especially as these performance indexes
   measure different dimensions.},

Abstract = {Responsiveness in manufacturing is now a key to a competitive edge in an
   advanced manufacturing environment. The mutual relationship with a
   supplier is important in formulating the responsive supply chain.
   Therefore, this study is carried out to discover the extent of supplier
   development (SD) practices in influencing the manufacturing
   responsiveness (MR) to the manufacturing firms particularly in Malaysia.
   Data was collected from 71 manufacturing firms that accredited ISO 14001
   via survey questionnaires. The results reveal that the development of
   suppliers has a positive and meaningful impact on MR. However, not all
   SD practices correlate equally to the MR practices. This finding can be
   used as a guideline for the manufacturing industry, mainly in Malaysia
   to understand better and deeper valuable information on the impact of SD
   practices towards manufacturing responsiveness as well as strengthening
   the SD practices to further enhance a responsiveness level in
   manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, the scope of some key subjects in operations
   management has extended beyond the single company to include supply
   chain (SC) partners and their interactions. One example of such an
   extension is the contemporary concept of supply chain flexibility (SCF).
   Although there has been considerable academic progress on SCF, most of
   the previous studies on this topic have been confined to a single firm,
   thereby neglecting other important aspects of a supply chain. Therefore,
   the development of empirical multi-tier studies capable of investigating
   the inter-organisational components of SCF is required. Within this
   context, this paper has the purpose of exploring the main effects of
   flexible SC capabilities or their lack at various tiers that limit the
   SC's ability to provide products to end-customers. The research design
   was a multiple case study with internal and external validity checks,
   within-case analysis and cross-case comparisons, based on a research
   framework that scrutinises the relationships between SC contextual
   constraints and flexibility types. The study took place in three
   representative SCs of the Brazilian automotive industry and sought
   mainly to identify and compare SC contextual constraints that hinder
   product delivery to end-customers. Constraints such as suppliers'
   capacity, diversity of suppliers, suppliers' cooperation, trust and
   commitment, tariffs, exchange rates and inventory were identified in
   different supplier tiers of the OEMs as the main factors influencing the
   observed volume and mix flexibilities. Additionally, SCF types such as
   sourcing, relational, delivery, postponement, new product and
   responsiveness influenced the SC's flexibility provided to the en. (C)

Abstract = {This paper addresses a scheduling problem in a flexible supply chain, in
   which the jobs can be either processed in house, or outsourced to a

   two special cases, in which the jobs have identical processing times.
   For the problem with limited outsourcing budgets, a NP-hardness proof, a
   pseudo-polynomial algorithm and a fully polynomial time approximation
   scheme are presented. For the problem with unlimited outsourcing
   budgets, the problem is shown to be equivalent to the shortest path
   problem, and therefore it is in class P. This shortest-path-problem
   solution approach is further shown to be applicable to a similar but
   more applicable problem, in which the number of deliveries is upper

Title = {Effect of SCF on automobile industry performance during sales
   promotional schemes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Purpose In today's competitive market subject to various uncertainties,
   supply chain flexibility (SCF) arose as a potential weapon to enhance
   the firm's performance. This paper model the effect of SCF on automobile
   industry performance during sales promotional schemes (SPS), which has
   turned out to be one of the most important marketing tools.
   Design/methodology/approach In view of the literature and the expert
   opinion taken from an automobile OEM, the SCFs and performance measures
   pertaining to the SPS environment have been identified. For the purpose
   of ranking the SCFs with respect to the performance measures, the
   Interpretive Ranking Process (IRP) has been applied using the direct
   contact method as a means for establishing the contextual relationships
   between SCFs and performance measures and to draw the interpreting
   reasons behind them. Findings The findings of this study along with the
   validity and stability of the results assessed through the system graphs
   and sensitivity analysis demonstrate that flexibility at the procurement
   end followed by the organizational end has the highest impact on the
   performance of the company during SPS. Originality/value Analysis of
   SCFs in regard to performance measures during SPS helps improve supply
   chain performance and offer valuable insights to the practicing managers
   in decision-making. This study augments the flexibility literature, by
   clubbing the two independent research streams, SCF and SPS.},

   the euro area, have increased over time, but are still relatively small.
   This is explained by the supply chain nature of trade integration: final
   demand in Germany is not necessarily the main determinant of CE4 exports

Title = {Green process innovation through Industry 4.0 technologies and supply
   chain coordination},
Journal = {ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Abstract = {This paper investigates a dynamic supply chain model in which a supplier
   decides both the wholesale price and the green process innovation
   investments while a manufacturer sets the retail price. We refer to
   Industry 4.0 technologies like Robotics, Automated Guided Vehicles and
   3D printing, which allow firms to reduce the amount of resources wasted
   and the emissions, generating an overall environmental benefit as well
   as a reduction of the marginal production cost. The environmental
   performance positively influences the demand, which leads to larger
   production volume and in turn damages the environmental performance via
   negative externalities (e.g., emissions). We resolve this operational
   trade-off and compare an uncoordinated setting to a revenue sharing
   contract complemented by a collaborative program. We show that the
   overall benefit of environmental cooperation in green process innovation
   entails the existence of a profit-Pareto-improving region. Nevertheless,
   the maximum environmental performance fails to occur in the
   profit-Pareto-improving region, which shows the mismatch between
   economic and environmental performance. Moreover, a wholesale price
   contract might help to enhance environmental performance while supply
   chains might prefer a revenue sharing contract or vertical integrated
   chain to maximize profits.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Enterprise risk management (ERM) has arguably become the dominant
   strategic management focus of organizations primarily due to a
   combination of factors-stakeholders' aversion to uncertainty, volatility
   of the current marketplace, and compliance mandates such as the
   Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a
   theory of the impact of ERM on two aspects of organizational
   performance, strategic flexibility and supply chain performance. The
   study is designed to examine conflicting views on the effect of
   increased levels of governance on organizations' flexibility and supply
   chain performance, and determine whether ERM capability influences the
   observed differential effects. Building on theories related to the
   electronic integration perspective of firm agility and the role of
   knowledge integration on the activation of the link between strategic
   flexibility and performance, we develop a theory of ERM as an enabler of
   IT integration, flexibility, and performance. A cross-sectional field
   study of six companies illustrates the interrelationships and provides
   preliminary support for the theory. Subsequent testing using data from
   155 Chief Audit Executives provides strong support for the theory. The
   results show that a broad-based, strategic approach to ERM enhances
   flexibility and strengthens the relationship between flexibility and
   performance. The results also provide evidence that enhanced IT
   integration is the mechanism through which ERM strengthens both
   flexibility and in turn performance. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the development of flexibility through my personal
   views and involvement in researching this complex concept. It
   differentiates between two modelling perspectives: the bottom-up
   perspective (from the flexibility of elements to integrated flexibility)
   of the early researchers for modelling flexible manufacturing systems
   (FMSs) and the more recent top-down perspective, from flexibility as a
   strategy to resources needed for implementing it. The bottom-up
   perspective is represented here by three papers. One paper focuses on
   Petri nets as a modelling tool, another offers a multi-factor design of
   experiments (DOE) view on factors affecting the performances of an FMS,
   and the third one presents a framework of logistic flexibility. The
   top-down perspective focuses on supply chain flexibility and uses
   quality function deployment (QFD) as a hierarchical modelling technique.
   An original framework for analysing the flexibility of generic objects,
   utilising cloud diagrams, is also presented. In all these papers a
   variety of changes that flexibility has to cope with are modelled,
   enabling the viewing of flexibility as a powerful ingredient for
   responding to changes and reducing risks in uncertain and changeable
   environments.},

Abstract = {This study explores how economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and financing
   supply chain jointly affect the leverage adjustment decision of China
   firms. Using the estimated targets across the distribution, we conceive
   a research framework that allows EPU to interact with financing supply
   chain in dynamic panel regression models. Our result reveals that EPU
   and financing supply chain are jointly important in affecting firm's
   leverage adjustment. It also suggests the conditions that can be used to
   assist people to make quick judgment about whether firms will have
   strong intentions of adjusting leverage towards target. Moreover, we
   find some conditions can symmetrically affect above and below-target
   firms' intentions of adjusting leverage.},

Title = {Supply chain resilience: an empirical examination of the bouncing back
   or forward phenomenon},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS},
Abstract = {Recently, scholars identify the significance of accurately capturing
   what it means to be resilient and its implications for firms and supply
   chains. This research advances the understanding of resilience and
   empirically identifies its influence towards `bouncing back' to the
   firms' previous supply chain state or `bouncing forward' through an
   evolution during and post-disruption. This research develops a
   theoretical resilience model grounded in TCE and Panarchy theory and
   tests its application through survey research and structural equation
   modelling across a mix of 15 industries with 298 supply chain
   professionals in the United States. This study finds that resilience
   leads to firms `bouncing back' or returning to their pre-disruption
   state after a disruption has occurred. Consequently, managers can focus
   their cognitive capacity towards `bouncing back' to the firm's previous
   state following a disruption and not misappropriating resources towards
   long-term supply chain reconfiguration heroics.},

Title = {Supply chain integration strategies in fast evolving industries},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {29-46},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to define the ``fast evolving
   industry{''} (FEI) and its supply chain management (SCM) challenges. The
   authors review and structure the literature regarding integration
   strategies and implementation methods to develop a strategic
   decision-making framework for SCM in the FEI.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conduct a review of SCM
   literature, including supply chain strategy, supply chain integration
   (SCI), agile and responsive supply chain and SCM for innovative and
   fast-changing industries. The authors develop a conceptual model and a
   decision-making framework and use four mini cases to provide support for
   the model and framework.
   Findings - The FEI, characterised by a high level of innovation and
   differentiation, short products/services lifecycle and high variety, is
   yet to be fully defined. Inherent uncertainty in FEI supply systems
   makes SCM in these industries a complex but strategic task for their
   managers. The framework and the model offered in this study, which
   employ a core competency concept and provide risk management strategies,
   offer a strategic tool for managers and scholars in the field to
   optimise their integration strategies and to operationalise integration
   decisions.
   Originality/value - Little research has been published on transferable
   and cross-industrial SCM in FEIs. This paper defines the FEI and its
   resource-related concerns and then offers a conceptual model and a
   strategic decision-making framework for SCI in FEIs.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {151},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper extends existing research on the dynamic behaviour of supply
   chains by including the influence of online reviews. We model an online
   supply chain which contains customers and one e-commerce retailer. By
   using simulation, we compare the dynamic performance in a supply chain
   for two scenarios, namely adopting an online review system and without
   adopting the system. The supply chain dynamic performance is measured by
   bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification. The results
   demonstrate that the online review system increases both the bullwhip
   effect and inventory variance amplification, and this impact can be
   moderated by product quality, unit mismatch cost, lead time, and
   customer volatility. We further explore how our model could be extended
   to include market competition, dual sourcing, online review
   manipulation, and product returns. As the increase in the bullwhip
   effect and inventory variance amplification can be associated with
   supply chain inefficiency, managers who are aware of such consequences
   induced by online review adoption can make better decisions in supply
   chain management.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},

Abstract = {This article presents a tactical supply chain planning model that can be
   used to investigate tradeoffs between cost and environmental degradation
   including carbon emissions, energy consumption and waste generation. The
   proposed model also incorporates other aspects of real world supply
   chains such as multiple transport lot sizing and flexible holding
   capacity of warehouses. A solution methodology, the Nested Integrated
   Cross-Entropy (NICE) method, is developed to solve the proposed
   mixed-integer nonlinear mathematical model. The application of the model
   and solution method is investigated in an actual case problem. Analysis
   of the numerical results focuses on investigating the relationship
   between lean practices and green outcomes. We find that (1) not all lean
   interventions at the tactical supply chain planning level result in
   green benefits, and (2) a flexible supply chain is the greenest and most
   efficient alternative when compared to strictly lean and centralized
   situations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2021},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Market conditions have become increasingly dynamic and demanding,
   resulting in a challenging competitive environment. To adapt to this
   dynamic environment, supply chains have become increasingly reliant on
   collaboration, integration, flexibility, and trust between stakeholders.
   Therefore, the importance of new technological applications in supply
   chains has grown even more. To improve supply chain flow control, modern
   specialized applications must be implemented. Blockchain technology has
   established itself as a necessary component of today's competitive
   environment. Companies should invest in blockchain technology to respond
   quickly to changing market conditions and demands in today's dynamic
   business environment. In this regard, this study investigates the effect
   of blockchain technology utilization on supply chain transparency,
   supply chain flexibility, and trust in suppliers. For this purpose,
   first, data were collected from the first 1000 exporting firms declared
   in 2019 by the Turkey Exporters Assembly using a survey method.
   Secondly, factor analyses and regression analyses were performed with
   the dataset obtained from 84 companies. As a result of the analysis, it
   was determined that blockchain technology utilization increases
   transparency, flexibility, and trust in supply chains. According to
   these results, it is suggested that companies should invest in
   blockchain technology to make their supply chain more transparent,
   flexible, and secure. Moreover, blockchain plays a crucial role in
   building mutual trust with supply chain stakeholders. Finally, the
   research includes some considerations on the positive implications and
   potential of blockchain in collaboration and integration.},

Title = {The Industry 5.0 framework: viability-based integration of the
   resilience, sustainability, and human-centricity perspectives},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Industry 5.0 is a combination of organisational principles and
   technologies to design and manage operations and supply chains as
   resilient, sustainable, and human-centric systems. While the general
   notion of Industry 5.0 has been elaborated, its implications for future
   operations and supply chains remain underexplored. This paper
   contributes to the conceptualisation of Industry 5.0 from the
   perspective of viability. We contextualise a framework of Industry 5.0
   through the lens of the viable supply chain model, the reconfigurable
   supply chain, and human-centric ecosystems. Our study uncovers the major
   dimensions that characterise Industry 5.0 as a
   technological-organisational framework. First, the major technological
   principles of Industry 5.0 are collaboration, coordination,
   communication, automation, data analytics processing, and
   identification. Second, Industry 5.0 covers four areas: organisation,
   management, technology, and performance assessment. Third, Industry 5.0
   spans three levels: society level, network level, and plant level. Last
   but not least, Industry 5.0 frames a new triple bottom line: resilient
   value creation, human well-being, and sustainable society. We provide a
   definition of Industry 5.0 and discuss its implications by elaborating
   on the understanding of value in Industry 5.0, which spans the
   dimensions of profit, people, and society. We also discuss open research
   areas.},

Abstract = {At a time where available data is rapidly increasing in both volume and

   support meaningful decision-making processes in dynamic supply chain
   (SC) contexts. Up until now, however, scarce attention has been given to
   the application of DM techniques in the field of inventory management.
   Here, we take advantage of descriptive DM to detect and grasp important
   patterns among several features that coexist in a real-world automotive
   SC. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to analyse and
   understand the interrelations between ten quantitative and dependent
   variables in a multi-item/multi-supplier environment. Afterwards, the
   principal component scores are characterised via a K-means clustering,
   allowing us to classify the samples into four clusters and to derive
   different profiles for the multiple inventory items. This work provides
   evidence that descriptive DM contributes to find interesting
   feature-patterns, resulting in the identification of important risk
   profiles that may effectively leverage inventory management for improved
   SC performance.},

Abstract = {This work extends the use of a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
   model, devised to optimize the Supply Chain planning problem, for
   decision making in cooperative and/or competitive scenarios, by
   integrating these models with the use of the Game Theory. The system
   developed is tested in a case study based in previously proposed Supply
   Chain, adapted to consider the operation of two different Supply Chains
   (multi-product production plants, storage centers, and distribution to
   the final consumers); two different optimization criteria are used to
   model both the Supply Chains benefits and the customer preferences, so
   both cooperative and non-cooperative way of working between both Supply
   Chains can be considered. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This contribution presents a multi-objective Mixed-Integer Linear
   Programming (MILP) synthesis of a dynamic supply-network under
   uncertainty applied to food industry. The previously-developed
   multi-objective model for achieving energy self-sufficiency by
   integrating renewables into companies' supply-networks has now been
   extended to account for the dynamic consideration of variable supply and
   demand over the year, for uncertainties related to products' demand and
   sun radiation, and for multi-objective optimisation, in order to obtain
   the most sustainable company's supply-network. The sustainable synthesis
   of a company's network is performed regarding the integration of
   renewables such as biomass and other wastes, and solar energy. The
   obtained solutions are those reflecting maximal profit, reflecting
   constantly-changing dynarnic market conditions, accounting for several
   uncertain parameters, and protecting the environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {A supply chain network design needs to consider the future probability
   of reconfiguration due to some problems of disaster or price changes.
   The objective of this article is to design a reconfigurable supply chain
   network by optimizing inventory allocation and transportation routing. A
   two-stage programming is composed according to Benders decomposition by
   allocating inventory in advance and anticipating the changes of
   transportation routings; thus the transportation routing is stochastic
   in nature. In addition, the fuzzy shortest path is developed to solve
   the problem complexity in terms of the multi-criteria of lead time and
   capacity with an efficient computational method. The results and
   analysis indicate that the proposed two-stage programming with fuzzy
   shortest path surpasses the performance of shortest path problem with
   time windows and capacity constraint (SPPTWCC) in terms of less
   computational time and CPU memory consumption. Finally, management
   decision-making is discussed among other concluding remarks. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Although flexibility has been considered critical in responding to
   uncertainty in a business environment, few studies have explored firms'
   flexibility in sustainable development. To understand the nature of
   firms that can respond better to uncertainty in their sustainable
   development practices, this study defines sustainable development
   flexibility and investigates the mechanism underlying its formation. The
   study proposes a conceptual framework on the interactions of managers'
   environmental attitude and cognitive style, as well as firms'
   information integration on sustainable development flexibility. A
   questionnaire survey was developed to test the corresponding hypotheses,
   and 241 valid responses were received from middle- and top-level
   managers in Chinese firms. The results show that (a) the higher the
   manager's environmental attitude, the higher the firm's information
   integration and greater sustainable supply chain flexibility, and (b)
   the more intuitive the manager's cognitive style, the greater the impact
   of environmental attitude on sustainable development flexibility.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by constructing
   supply chain network optimization models, which explicitly include labor
   as an important variable in the network economic activity links, along
   with associated capacities. Labor is a critical resource in supply
   chains from production to transportation, storage, and distribution. In
   a pandemic, the availability of labor for different supply chain network
   activities may be disrupted due to illness, fear of contagion,
   morbidity, necessity of social/physical distancing, etc. The modeling
   framework considers first elastic demands for a product and then fixed
   demands, coupled with distinct types of labor capacities in order to
   capture the availability of this valuable resource in a pandemic, as
   well as possible flexibility. The supply chain network framework, which
   includes electronic commerce, is relevant to many different supply chain
   applications including protective personal and medical equipment, as
   well as to particular food items. Theoretical results as well as
   computed numerical examples are presented.},

   Using three different scenarios of various average on hand inventory

   find that the supply chain configuration can be highly sensitive to the
   probability distribution of the carbon credit price. More importantly,
   we observe that carbon price and budget availability for supply chain
   reconfiguration can both have a positive but nonlinear relationship with

   responsiveness capabilities. In addition, a product variety management
   strategy has different impacts on performance depending on the level of
   product customization. Specifically, in a low-customization environment,
   both supply chain flexibility and agility acting as dynamic capabilities
   have a significant influence on cost efficiency while in a

Abstract = {Epidemic blockade leads to increased uncertainty and dynamic supply
   network disruption. This study considers an uncertain optimization of
   dynamic supply networks with risk preference and order delivery
   disruption. Taking the subjective utility of downstream enterprises as a
   reference point for the utility measurement of order delivery disruption
   and risk preference, this study constructs a biobjective optimization
   model with the goal of maximizing the downstream firm's subjective
   utility and minimizing the manufacturer's cost. The influence of each
   parameter in the downstream firm's subjective utility function on the
   integrated optimization was analysed. The research found that the
   uncertain optimization model with the risk preference of downstream
   firms for order delivery disruption better controls the actual
   manufacturer's order allocation and distribution problems when
   considering the downstream firms' behaviour preference characteristics
   under bounded rationality. When allocating orders, manufacturers should
   consider that changes in order delivery disruption will cause changes in
   the subjective utility of downstream enterprises. In the process of
   multiperiod cooperation between manufacturers and downstream firms, they
   can obtain downstream firm risk preferences through repeated

Abstract = {This study contributes to the construction of sustainable supply chain
   capabilities in the textile industry. Previous studies are lacking with
   regard to sustainable supply chain capabilities: specifically, there are
   hierarchical structures and measures in qualitative information and
   quantitative data in nature. In addition, previous studies do not
   integrate social media with qualitative information and quantitative
   data, even though social media is an important reference for
   decision-making. Hence, this study applied the fuzzy synthetic
   evaluation and decision-making trial evaluation laboratory to address
   linguistic preferences and provide a strategic approach for the proposed
   attributes. The results present the integration of qualitative
   information and quantitative data for building a hierarchical structure
   with sustainable supply chain capabilities and indicate that social,
   dynamic and information capabilities are simultaneously strongly
   affected. The top seven criteria that most influence sustainable supply
   chain capabilities are outbound logistics flexibility, supply chain
   reconceptualization, information quality, coevolution, market-oriented
   perception, partner development and knowledge acquisition and absorptive
   capacity. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. (C)

Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {347-356},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In today's market conditions, volume of demand is quite uncertain and
   thus it is hard to estimate. In many cases, buyer is prone to use supply
   chain flexibility rather than inventory holding strategy to withstand
   demand uncertainty. We assume that the buyer releases a replenishment
   order to the supplier for each cycle (or period) under the contract
   which is mainly composed of four parameters: (1) supply cost per unit,
   (2) minimum order quantity, (3) order quantity reduction penalty and (4)
   maximum capacity of the supplier. Based on these parameters, there are
   two flexibility options that buyer should evaluate in the order of cycle
   (1) issue an order smaller than the minimum order quantity and pay the
   related penalty and (2) place no order and lose the sales. Hence, Q
   (lost) emerges as a critical buyer decision, the order quantity, below
   which no order is placed. Total expected supply cost plus lost sales, as
   a function of Q (lost) is presented. We derive the optimal Q (lost) that
   minimises the total cost function. Since capacity of each supplier is
   finite, we then develop a supplier selection model with total cost
   minimisation over the suppliers subject to capacity constraint that has
   a stochastic nature stemming from demand behaviour. Linearisation on the
   model is performed using chance-constrained programming approach. From a
   given set of supply bids from the potential supply chain partners, the
   buyer is able to make a quantifiable choice.},

Title = {Innovative Methodology for the Identification of the Most Suitable
   Additive Technology Based on Product Characteristics},
Journal = {METALS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper reports the study and development case of an innovative
   application of the Cloud Manufacturing paradigm. Based on the definition
   of an appropriate web-based application, the infrastructure is able to
   connect the possible client requests and the relative supply chain
   product/process development capabilities and then attempt to find the
   best available solutions. In particular, the main goal of the developed
   system, called AMSA (Additive Manufacturing Spare parts market
   Application), is the definition of a common platform to supply different
   kinds of services that have the following common reference points in the
   Additive Manufacturing Technologies (DFAM, Design For Additive
   Manufacturing): product development, prototypes, or small series
   production and reverse engineering activities to obtain Computer-Aided
   Design (CAD) models starting from a physical object. The definition of
   different kinds of services allows satisfying several client needs such
   as innovative product definition characterized by high performance in
   terms of stiffness/weight ratio, the possibility of manufacturing small
   series, such as in the motorsport field, and the possibility of defining
   CAD models for the obsolete parts for which the geometrical information
   is missed. The AMSA platform relies on the reconfigurable supply chain
   that is dynamic, and it depends on the client needs. For example, when
   the client requires the manufacture of a small series of a component,
   AMSA allows the technicians to choose the best solutions in terms of
   delivery time, price, and logistics. Therefore, the suppliers that
   contribute to the definition of the dynamic supply chain have an
   important role. For these reasons, the AMSA platform represents an
   important and innovative tool that is able to link the suppliers to the
   customers in the best manner in order to obtain services that are
   characterized by a high-performance level. Therefore, a provisional
   model has been implemented that allows filtering the technologies
   according to suitable performance indexes. A specific aspect for which
   AMSA can be considered unique is related with the given possibility to
   access Design for Additive Manufacturing Services through the Web in
   accordance with the possible additive manufacturing technologies.},

Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-17},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {In this paper, we present a logistics service provider (LSP) constrained
   supply chain problem, particularly; we propose a novel supply chain
   model that consists of three layers of non/cooperative manufacturers,
   distribution centers and retailers. Products flow from the manufacturers
   across different warehouses to retailers via LSP. Inventories at
   warehouses follow smooth and continuous replenishment policy, i.e.,
   perpetual review. The supply chain is represented as an optimization
   model that maximizes the revenue of manufacturers meets the retailers'
   demand and at the same time identifies the necessary warehouses,
   particularly for supply chains that are affected by leadtime (LT)
   variation such as fast response industry and short life products. The
   model solution is adaptive; it determines the best manufacturing rates
   and identifies the logistic bottlenecks in dynamic supply chain
   networks. Numerical solutions along with simulation experiments of
   different supply chain topologies are presented. The simulation results
   demonstrate the model capability to maximize the revenues by tuning the
   manufacturing rates and monitoring the workinprocess, products in
   transit as well as products in inventories},

   Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Circular economy is an alternative to the traditional production model
   and has therefore attracted a great deal of attention from researchers.
   The change in the production system is accompanied by new logistical
   needs related both to resources and waste and to the distribution and
   recovery of products. The circular supply chain involves return
   processes and the manufacturer intends to capture additional value in
   the supply chain. In this paper, value chains have been mapped to
   visualize the links and interactions between the different stages and
   actors to understand the complexities of these systems and to make
   informed decisions. For this reason, and based on thorough literature
   review, the final objective of this work is to achieve a conceptual
   framework to study circular supply chain, which uses the main
   theoretical perspectives in strategic management literature. Four
   dimensions have been identified to support the development of these new
   supply chains-greater intensity in the relationships established in the
   supply chain, adaptation of logistics and organizational, disruptive and
   smart technologies, and a functioning environment. It can be concluded
   that to develop a new relationship capacity will allow for reaching more
   frequent, closer relationships with more actors. These relationships
   will be developed within an adapted organizational and logistical
   framework that is framed in new business model archetypes. However,
   dimensions related to the business environment such as sectoral,
   legislative, and fiscal frameworks must be incorporated.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},

Volume = {230},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The resource-based view (RBV) has long been adopted in strategic
   management yyresearch, but its use in operations management (OM)
   research is relatively new. Many empirical studies based upon RBV have
   investigated OM functions/capabilities and their impacts on business
   performance. Despite the considerable amount of research that has been
   conducted, there is no meta-analysis of application of RBV in the OM
   field. Hitt et al. (2016) reviewed the use and application of RBV in OM,
   based upon studies published in nine elite OM journals in the period
   2007-2013. We take a meta-analytic approach to statistically combine and
   critically analyse application of RBV in OM over the period 2007-2020.
   We identify three primary operational functions/capabilities, namely
   flexibility, supply chain integration, and organizational capability,
   that have a positive impact on business performance in general, and on
   competitive performance, financial performance, and operational
   performance in particular. This study contributes to the literature on

Abstract = {This paper proposes an adaptive fuzzy control application to support a

   Burbidge effects and finally the Bullwhip effect. The results show that
   the adaptive fuzzy VMI control surpasses fuzzy VMI control and
   traditional VMI in terms of mitigating the Bullwhip effect and lower
   delivery overshoots and backorders. This paper also guides management in
   allocating inventory by coordinating suppliers and buyers to ensure
   minimum inventory levels across a supply chain. Adaptive fuzzy VMI

Abstract = {Today?s supply chains are very different from those of just a few years
   ago, and they continue to evolve within an extremely competitive
   economy. Dynamic supply chain processes require a technology that can
   cope with their increasing complexity. In recent years, several
   functional supply chain applications based on artificial intelligence
   (AI) have emerged, yet very few studies have addressed the applications
   of AI in supply chain processes. Machine learning, natural language
   processing, and robotics are all potential enablers of supply chain
   transformation. Aware of the potential advantages of AI implementation
   in supply chains and of the paucity of work done regarding it, we
   explore what researchers have done so far with respect to AI and what
   needs further exploration. We reviewed 136 research papers published
   between 1996 and 2020 from the Scopus database and provided a
   classification of the research material according to four critical
   structural dimensions (level of analytics, AI algorithms or techniques,
   sector or industry of application, and supply chain processes). This
   study is the first attempt to study the AI applications in SC from a

Title = {Lean resilience: AURA (Active Usage of Resilience Assets) framework for
   post-COVID-19 supply chain management},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Purpose Supply chain resilience capabilities are usually considered in
   light of some anticipated events and are as passive assets, which are
   ``waiting{''} for use in case of an emergency. This, however, can be
   inefficient. Moreover, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed
   difficulties in the timely deployments of resilience assets and their
   utilization for value creation. We present a framework that consolidates
   different angles of efficient resilience and renders utilization of
   resilience capabilities for creation of value.
   Design/methodology/approach We conceptualise the design of the AURA
   (Active Usage of Resilience Assets) framework for post-COVID-19 supply
   chain management through collating the extant literature on value
   creation-oriented resilience and practical examples and complementing
   our analysis with a discussion of practical implementations. Findings
   Building upon and integrating the existing frameworks of VSC (Viable
   Supply Chain), RSC (Reconfigurable Supply Chain) and LCNSC
   (Low-Certainty-Need Supply Chain), we elaborate on a new idea in the
   AURA approach - to consider resilience as an inherent, active and
   value-creating component of operations management decisions, rather than
   as a passive ``shield{''} to protect against rare, severe events. We
   identify 10 future research areas for lean resilience integrating
   management and digital platforms and technology. Practical implications
   The outcomes of our study can be used by supply chain and operations
   managers to improve the efficiency and effectiveness by turning
   resilience from passive, cost-driving assets into a value-creating,
   inclusive decision-making paradigm. Originality/value We propose a novel
   approach to bring more dynamics to the notion of supply chain
   resilience. We name our approach AURA and articulate its two major
   advantages as follows: (1) reduction of disruption prediction efforts
   and (2) value creation from resilience assets. We offer a discussion on
   ten future research directions towards a lean resilience.},

Abstract = {Research on supply chain (SC) digitalization, resilience, sustainability
   and leagility has remarkably progressed, most of it focused on the
   individual contributions of these four major frameworks. However, a lack
   of integration spanning these individual frameworks can be observed. In
   this conceptual paper, we hypothesize that reconfigurability can be
   considered such an integral perspective that consolidates the research
   in SC adaptation to ever changing environments. We theorize a new notion
   - a Reconfigurable SC or the X-network - that exhibits some crucial
   design and control characteristics for complex value-adding systems in
   highly vulnerable environments. We support our argumentation and
   conceptual viewpoints by a literature analysis along with tertiary
   studies to review and structure contextual factors of designing the
   X-networks. We propose respective frameworks and discuss the
   implementation principles and technologies at the macro and micro
   levels. Two novel concepts - dynamic SC meta-structures and dynamic
   autonomous services - are introduced. Distinctively, we go beyond the
   existing knowledge to predict proactively the future directions in the
   reconfigurable SCs. Our results can be of value for decision-makers to
   decipher chances and barriers in contemporary SC transformations.},

Volume = {41},

Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {Purpose Catastrophic supply chain disruptions can significantly damage
   the operational and financial performance of firms. While a growing body
   of literature on supply network structures has studied what influences
   supply networks' vulnerability to supply chain disruptions and
   capability to recover from them, it remains unclear how supply network
   structures change after major supply chain disruptions. We aim to
   provide an understanding of how these changes occur.
   Design/methodology/approach Using a natural experiment approach and
   supply network data from Factset, this study investigates how firms'
   supply network structures change after experiencing the catastrophic
   supply chain disruptions caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and
   tsunami in Japan. We capture post-earthquake supply network changes
   using the measures of degree centrality and ego network density.
   Findings The results of the analysis suggest that compared to unaffected
   firms, the affected firms experience changes in their supply network
   structures tending toward lower complexity measured by in-degree
   centrality, out-degree centrality and ego network density.
   Originality/value This study contributes to social network theory and
   the complex adaptive supply network literature by providing empirical
   evidence of structural changes in supply networks after catastrophic
   supply chain disruptions. A managerial contribution is made by providing
   a reflection on why these changes might be occurring and alert firms to
   the challenges of managing complexity in their supply networks.},

Abstract = {Classical principal-agent model based on the hypothesis of

   economics; however, it reduces the stability of long-term cooperation
   and cannot reflect win-win cooperation. The paper introduces principal's
   value parameter reflecting win-win relation into incentive strategy,
   expands the traditional model, and establishes service supply chain
   dynamic incentive model from the perspective of win-win. In the new
   incentive strategy, the paper further considers implicit incentive and
   service provider's opportunism behaviour. Research shows that the value
   preference parameter can effectively coordinate the value relation
   between service integrator and service provider, motivate service
   provider to improve productive input and decrease opportunistic
   behaviour; implicit incentive has definite substitute effect on explicit
   incentive; under the joint effect of explicit and implicit incentives,
   service provider will keep higher productive input level, and its
   opportunistic input will be controlled effectively at the same time.},

Title = {Relation between lead time dependent demand and capacity flexibility in

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {194},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {13-24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Supply chain literature shows that speed of delivery, or equivalently
   provided delivery lead time, is a crucial performance factor and
   influences the expected customer demand. However, short delivery lead
   times imply stochastic demand peaks, for which production economics
   literature indicates that flexible capacity can be applied to mitigate
   their negative effects. In this paper a two stage supply chain with
   flexible capacity at the supplier and lead time dependent demand at the
   customer is investigated. Specifically, the random customer demand
   depends on the delivery lead time provided by the supplier and demand
   which cannot be fulfilled is lost. An analytical model is developed
   which includes predefined steady capacity and a demand dependent
   decision for flexible capacity. The trade-off between lost sales due to
   the provided delivery lead time, lost sales due to a lack of capacity,
   inventory cost and the cost for flexible capacity is discussed.
   Numerical results indicate that high capacity flexibility is needed if
   lost sales cost, demand variance, or customer lead time sensitivity is
   high. Furthermore, the positive effect of information sharing within the
   supply chain is evaluated.},

Volume = {52},
Number = {9-10},
Pages = {1981-2004},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to examine the effect of external supply chain
   (SC) flexibility on the product innovation performance of small- and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the contingent role of informal
   control mechanisms in moderating such an effect.
   Design/methodology/approach This study conducts a cross-sectional
   questionnaire survey of 236 UK-based SME manufacturers.
   Findings Inbound supplier flexibility (ISF) has a stronger positive
   effect on SMEs' product innovation performance than outbound logistics
   flexibility (OLF), and that the strength and direction of both effects
   depend on informal control mechanisms. Lead supplier influence
   negatively moderates the relationship between ISF and product innovation
   performance but positively moderates the relationship between OLF and
   product innovation performance. Normative integration positively
   moderates the relationship between ISF and product innovation
   performance.
   Research limitations/implications This study enriches SC flexibility
   studies by focusing on understanding the differential effects of ISF and
   OLF on product innovation performance, as well as the role that
   contingency factors play in these relationships in the SME context.
   Practical implications To promote product innovation performance, SME
   managers should focus on building good relationships with their
   suppliers rather than their logistics service providers. SME managers
   should be particularly aware of the different types of informal control
   mechanisms that govern their SC relationships and adjust their
   managerial approaches accordingly.
   Originality/value This study distinguishes between ISF and OLF and
   examines their impacts on SMEs' product innovation performance. This
   study investigates the differential effects of lead supplier influence

Abstract = {In recent years, supply chain optimization has become a major topic in
   operational research. Huge effort s were made to outline effective
   methodologies both from computational and final solution quality
   perspective. However, besides being optimal, one major need of supply
   chains is flexibility and adaptability to disturbances. This research
   work aims at the definition of a thorough procedure for flexible supply
   chain design able to exploit deterministic and stochastic flexibility
   indices. The Traveling Deliveryman Problem was then selected as case
   study since it represents the most basic operational research problem.
   The adaptation of flexibility assessment methodologies, primarily
   conceived for unit operations, provides good results and allows to
   properly identify criticalities. In addition, it proves that the optimal
   solutions under uncertainty are confined to a limited subset among
   million possible alternatives according to the expected deviation
   nature. This procedure is then worth to be extended to more complex
   systems in future studies. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Health Products Company. This study used Vensim software to develop and
   validate supply chain modeling. In this regard, first identifies the
   components and variables of the chain based on the existing literature
   and then presents the dynamic hypothesis and after the causal loops and
   rate-state diagrams, tests the model based on the system dynamics
   method. Finally, the accuracy of the model is tested and policies to
   reduce lost sales, reduce inventory and receive accurate information to
   improve model indicators are presented. Based on the results, with a
   slight change in the logic of deciding the time of issuing orders from
   the distribution center to the production plant and knowing the
   inventory of raw materials at that time, the amount of reliability
   reserve, central warehouse inventory and distribution center warehouse
   inventory can overcome this problem. Can be a reason to increase the
   reactivity of the chain.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an integrated, auto-reconfigurable power-supply
   network to enhance system lifetime and efficiency in self-reliant
   energy-harvesting applications. Carbon nanotube (CNT) supercapacitors
   are employed as both energy storage devices and power sources, thereby
   achieving multidirectional energy exchange. By leveraging advanced
   semiconductor processes, a low-volume, cost-effective single-inductor
   multiple-output (SIMO) power management unit (PMU) is developed, which
   connects all the supercapacitors into an autonomous power-supply
   network. The PMU enables reversible power flows, shorter power-delivery
   paths, and effective energy reutilization, which enhances the
   reliability and flexibility of the system. The use of CNT
   supercapacitors features small form factor and high energy/power
   density, making them highly attractive for power-constrained devices. A
   prototype of the PMU is fabricated with a 0.35-mu m N-well CMOS process,
   with a chip area of approximately 4.3 mm(2). The PMU interconnects 3-CNT
   supercapacitors in the power-supply network, and operates from 1.5 to 3
   V. The measured peak energy-transfer efficiency is 85.03\%. The
   supercapacitors deliver an energy density of 6.2 Wh/kg, at a high power
   density of 79 kW/kg and exhibit excellent stability of 98.5\% retention,
   at a current density of 50 A/g.},

Abstract = {Contemporary (third-party logistics providers) TPLs are in danger of
   being stuck in the middle, unable to perform customer adaptation as well
   as before and unable to achieve sufficient economies of scale. This
   conceptual paper aims to explore challenges facing the strategic
   development of TPLs within a context of increased digitalization,
   e-commerce and servitization. There are two apparent strategic paths.
   Under circumstances of strong price pressure, there is demand for
   standardized TPL services offering simplicity, minimalism and
   functionality based on digitalization, e-commerce and servitization.
   Alternatively, with market developments responsive to supply chain
   complexity, digitalization, e-commerce and servitization enable
   development towards innovation and change. We conclude that these
   developments do not invalidate existing frameworks for TPL strategies
   but contribute alternative strategies. We formulate three propositions
   for each strategic path. To avoid being stuck in the middle, TPLs are
   encouraged to either develop efficient services through servitized
   logistics chains and digital solutions or develop advanced solutions to
   integrate the consumer into the logistics network system through
   competencies to control increased levels of complexity.},

Title = {Flexibility evaluation of multiechelon supply chains},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 27},
Abstract = {Multiechelon supply chains are complex logistics systems that require
   flexibility and coordination at a tactical level to cope with
   environmental uncertainties in an efficient and effective manner. To
   cope with these challenges, mathematical programming models are
   developed to evaluate supply chain flexibility. However, under
   uncertainty, supply chain models become complex and the scope of
   flexibility analysis is generally reduced. This paper presents a unified
   approach that can evaluate the flexibility of a four-echelon supply
   chain via a robust stochastic programming model. The model
   simultaneously considers the plans of multiple business divisions such
   as marketing, logistics, manufacturing, and procurement, whose goals are
   often conflicting. A numerical example with deterministic parameters is
   presented to introduce the analysis, and then, the model stochastic
   parameters are considered to evaluate flexibility. The results of the
   analysis on supply, manufacturing, and distribution flexibility are
   presented. Tradeoff analysis of demand variability and service levels is
   also carried out. The proposed approach facilitates the adoption of
   different management styles, thus improving supply chain resilience. The
   model can be extended to contexts pertaining to supply chain
   disruptions; for example, the model can be used to explore operation
   strategies when subtle events disrupt supply, manufacturing, or
   distribution.},

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},

Abstract = {In this paper, we develop both static and dynamic supply chain network
   models with multiple manufacturers and freight service providers
   competing on price and quality. The manufacturers compete with one
   another in terms of price and quality of the product manufactured,
   whereas the freight service providers compete on price and quality of
   the transportation service they provide for multiple modes. Both
   manufacturers and freight service providers maximize their utilities
   (profits) while considering the consequences of the competitors' prices
   and quality levels. Bounds on prices and quality levels are included
   that have relevant policy-related implications. The governing
   equilibrium conditions of the static model are formulated as a
   variational inequality problem. The underlying dynamics are then
   described, with the stationary point corresponding to the variational
   inequality solution. An algorithm which provides a discrete-time
   adjustment process and tracks the evolution of the quality levels and
   prices over time is proposed, and convergence results given. Numerical
   examples illustrate how such a supply chain network framework, which is
   relevant to products ranging from high value to low value ones, can be
   applied in practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Purpose Despite the ongoing calls for the incorporation of the cloud
   utility model, the effect of the cloud on elements of supply chain
   performance is still an evolving area of research. The purpose of this
   paper is to develop the architecture of a cloud-based supply chain
   management (C-SCM) ecosystem and explore how it enhances supply chain
   responsiveness (SCR). Design/methodology/approach First, the authors
   discuss the potential benefits that cloud computing can yield, compared
   to existing mature SCM information systems and solutions through a
   comprehensive literature review. The authors conceptualise SCR in terms
   of the level of visibility in the supply chain, supply chain flexibility
   and rapid detection and reaction to changes, and then the authors build
   the detailed architecture of a C-SCM system. The proposed ecosystem
   introduces a view of SCM and the associated practices when transferred
   to cloud environments. The potential to enhance SCR through the cloud is
   explored with scenarios on a case of supply chain operations in fashion
   retail industry. Findings The findings show that the proposed system can
   enhance all three dimensions of SCR. Implications for supply chain
   practice and how companies can migrate to a cloud supply chain are
   drawn. Originality/value Given that the development, creation and
   delivery of goods and services are increasingly becoming a joint effort
   of several parties in a supply chain, the authors contribute to the
   existing literature by introducing a comprehensive C-SCM system and show
   how companies can enhance their SCR.},

Title = {Myopic versus Farsighted Behaviors in a Low-Carbon Supply Chain with
   Reference Emission Effects},
Journal = {COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2019},
Abstract = {The increased carbon emissions cause relatively climate deterioration
   and attract more attention of governments, consumers, and enterprises to
   the low-carbon manufacturing. This paper considers a dynamic supply
   chain, which is composed of a manufacturer and a retailer, in the
   presence of the cap-and-trade regulation and the consumers' reference
   emission effects. To investigate the manufacturer's behavior choice and
   its impacts on the emission reduction and pricing strategies together
   with the profits of both the channel members, we develop a Stackelberg
   differential game model in which the manufacturer acts in both myopic
   and farsighted manners. By comparing the equilibrium strategies, it can
   be found that the farsighted manufacturer always prefers to keep a lower
   level of emission reduction. When the emission permit price is
   relatively high, the wholesale/retail price is lower if the manufacturer
   is myopic and hence benefits consumers. In addition, there exists a
   dilemma that the manufacturer is willing to act in a farsighted manner
   but the retailer looks forward to a partnership with the myopic
   manufacturer. For a relatively high price of emission permit, adopting
   myopic strategies results in a better performance of the whole supply

Abstract = {This study explores trust and shared vision moderate the relationship
   between the manufacturer's influence strategies and supplier delivery
   flexibility. The major components of this study are based on reviews of
   marketing research that focus on influence strategies and literature
   regarding supply chain flexibility. The results show that the request
   strategy has a negative effect on supplier delivery flexibility. The
   model predicts that trust and shared vision have an asymmetrical effect
   across recommendations, information exchange, and promises influence
   strategies. When the relationship contains a highly shared vision, a
   manufacturer's use of the recommendation influence strongly promotes
   supplier delivery flexibility, whereas the use of a promise strategy
   depresses supplier delivery flexibility. In contrast, an information
   exchange strategy will have a negative effect, but the promise strategy
   will have a positive effect on supplier delivery flexibility when trust
   is high. This paper contributes to guidelines for management on how to

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the specific role of supply
   chain capabilities (SCCs) in the implementation of green operations (GO)
   strategies. More importantly, it examines whether this relationship
   between SCCs and GO is contingent on corporate environmental proactivity
   (EP). Theoretical predictions of the conceptual model were tested using
   hierarchical regression analyses of data obtained from 225 senior
   logistics/supply chain managers in the global auto sector. To ensure the
   robustness of our findings, a post-hoc analysis using the partial least
   squares approach was conducted. Significant positive associations exist
   between specific SCCs and the adoption of GO strategies. EP positively
   moderates the external integration capability green purchasing and the
   supplier appraisal capability green manufacturing linkages. However,
   unexpectedly, EP negatively moderates the effect of internal integration
   capability on green purchasing. Equally surprising, consistent negative
   moderation effects are detected for supply chain flexibility on green
   design, green purchasing, and green manufacturing. This study
   contributes to the existing resource-based view literature by focusing
   on the capability strategy linkage and its specific application to
   environmental management. The exploration of the moderating effects of
   EP confirms the important role of organizing context in the effective
   exploitation and deployment of resources and capabilities.},

Abstract = {In today's complex and dynamic supply chain markets, information systems
   are essential for effective supply chain management. Complex decision
   making processes on strategic, tactical, and operational levels require
   substantial timely support in order to contribute to organizations'
   agility. Consequently, there is a need for sophisticated dynamic product
   pricing mechanisms that can adapt quickly to changing market conditions
   and competitors' strategies. We propose a two-layered machine learning
   approach to compute tactical pricing decisions in real time. The first
   layer estimates prevailing economic conditionseconomic
   regimesidentifying and predicting current and future market conditions.
   In the second layer, we train a neural network for each regime to
   estimate price distributions in real time using available information.
   The neural networks compute offer acceptance probabilities from a
   tactical perspective to meet desired sales quotas. We validate our
   approach in the trading agent competition for supply chain management.
   When competing against the world's leading agents, the performance of
   our system significantly improves compared to using only economic
   regimes to predict prices. Profits increase significantly even though
   the prices and sales volume do not change significantly. Instead,
   tactical pricing results in a more efficient sales strategy by reducing
   both finished goods and components inventory costs.},

   supply chain model: A case study at Manaus Industrial Pole},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {This paper discusses transport modes supporting Uncertainty Supply Chain
   Model (USCM) in the case of Manaus Industrial Pole (PIM), an industrial
   cluster in the Brazilian Amazon that hosts six hundred factories with
   diverse logistics and supply chain managerial strategies. USCM (Lee,
   2002; Fisher, 1997) develops a dot matrix classification of the supply
   chains considering several attributes (e.g., agility, cost, security,
   responsiveness) and argues that emergent economies industrial clusters,
   in the effort to keep attractiveness for technological frontier firms,
   need to adapt supply chain strategies according to USCM attributes. The
   paper takes a further step, discussing which transport modes are
   suitable to each supply chain classified at the USCM in PIM's case. The
   research's methods covered the use of PIM's statistical official
   database (secondary data), interviews with the main logistical services
   providers of PIM and phone survey with a sample of firms (primary data).
   Findings confirm the theoretical argument that different supply chains
   will demand different transport modes running at the same time in the
   same industrial cluster (Oliveira, 2009). In the case of PIM, this
   implies investments on port and airport infrastructure and a strategic
   focus on air transport mode, due to (1) short life cycle of products,
   (2) distance from suppliers, (3) quick response to demand and (4) the
   fact that even PIM's standard products use, in average, forty per cent
   of air transport at inbound logistics.},

Number = {1, SI},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {In recent years, remarkable advancements have been achieved in
   quantitative analysis methods for supply chain design (SCD). Typically,
   cost or service level optimisation has been included in the objective
   functions. At the same time, supply chain managers face the ripple
   effect that arises from vulnerability, instability and disruptions in
   supply chains. This research aimed to quantify the ripple effect in the
   supply chain from the structural perspective. The research agenda of
   this study includes issues of integrating operability objectives as new
   key performance indicators, e.g. resilience, stability, robustness into
   SCD decisions. The research is based on a simultaneous consideration of
   both static structural properties of SCD and execution dynamics subject
   to uncertainty and disruptions. Due to high dimensionality of real SCD
   problems, such integration can hardly be implemented in only one model.
   In this study, an original two-model multi-criteria approach is proposed
   in order to assess the potential ability of an SCD to remain stable and
   resilient. This modelling approach is based on a combined application of
   a static and a dynamic model. A multi-criteria approach relies on the
   analytic hierarchy process method. The results of this research can be
   used as an additional quantitative analysis tool in order to select an
   SCD. An additional application of the developed method is that it can be
   used at the control stage in order to adapt supply chain execution
   subject to the achievement of desired economic performance.},

Abstract = {There is increased interest in relocation to and from highcost
   environments, but there remains a lack of knowledge with regard to
   operations capabilities in this specific context. The purpose of this
   study is thus to investigate critical operations capabilities in a
   high-cost environment. The research process is based on the
   investigation of an existing framework of operations capabilities
   through a multiple case study including five Swedish manufacturing
   companies. The findings reveal that all the dimensions and capabilities
   included in the framework were considered critical, and additional
   operations capabilities could be identified: service quality, supplier
   dependability, supplier flexibility, supply chain innovation, supply
   chain sustainability. The investigation underlines the dynamic nature of
   operations capabilities, which need to be updated constantly according
   to the environment in which they are developed. This study contributes
   on a practical level to managers by creating an overview of operations
   capabilities in a high-cost environment. Through the investigation of
   critical operations capabilities, it is possible for managers to find
   new areas of competitiveness, as well as to understand their current
   areas of excellence. The study makes several contributions, such as the

Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {842-852},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The possibilities of balancing gas supply and demand with a green gas
   supply chain were analyzed. The considered supply chain is based on
   co-digestion of cow manure and maize, the produced biogas is upgraded to
   (Dutch) natural gas standards. The applicability of modeling yearly gas
   demand data in a geographical region by Fourier analysis was
   investigated. For a sine shape gas demand, three scenarios were further
   investigated: varying biogas production in time, adding gas storage to a
   supply chain, and adding a second digester to the supply chain which is
   assumed to be switched off during the summer months. A regional gas
   demand modeled by a sine function is reasonable for household type of
   users as well as for business areas, or a mixture of those. Of the
   considered scenarios, gas storage is by far the most expensive. When gas
   demand has to be met by a green gas supply chain, flexible biogas
   production is an interesting option. Further research in this direction
   might open interesting pathways to sustainable gas supply chains. (C)

   gained by managing and negotiating the existing supply chain functions
   during her collaboration with Tommy Hilfiger (R) to launch the first

   case study was deployed. The authors found that supply chain networks
   required unique adaptations to their existing manufacturing processes to
   ensure the adaptive design innovations were viable; however, those
   supply chain adaptations were not significant. Further, the authors
   found that a collaborative partnership with an advocate seemingly

Abstract = {This article studies port strategy from a supply chain perspective
   considering the case of Hong Kong. Hong Kong port used to be the world's
   busiest container port, but it is now in danger of losing its hub status
   due to rising competition from neighboring lower-cost rivals. The
   analysis shows that Hong Kong's free port status and world-class customs
   clearance offer the port a sustainable and considerable advantage to
   shorten transit time. The port is thus a strategic fit for the shipping
   of high-value and time-sensitive cargoes, and should pursue an agile
   strategy for a responsive supply chain. It is imperative for the port to
   strengthen its core competencies in agility by retaining a favorable
   position in port rotation with shipping lines and raising the efficiency
   of barging. Further reducing cost substantially would be beneficial, but
   might not be feasible and should not be the primary nor sole focus of

Abstract = {In the era of economic globalization, product trading markets are
   strongly impacted. The comprehensive utilization of e-waste is an
   important way to integrate green supply chains and improve resource

   green supply chain dynamic game model and examines the impact of the
   trade-in strategy on the integration of the green supply chain. The
   results show that offset price, recovery price, and recovery quantity
   are positively correlated with the income through their respective
   channels. The transfer payment price is positively correlated with the
   revenue of the two channels. Trade-in strategy will increase the offset
   price, recovery price, and manufacturers' profits. However, the profits
   of retailers and e-commerce platforms are affected by the
   substitutability coefficient between channels and the sensitivity of
   recovery price. The optimal equilibrium in the supply chain is conducive

   Third-party Supply chain (RTS) systems and identify several inherent
   security and efficiency requirements. We further design a Secure RTS
   system called SRTS, which leverages RFID tags to deliver
   computation-lightweight crypto-IDs in the RTS system to meet both the
   security and efficiency requirements. SRTS introduces a Private
   Verifiable Signature (PVS) scheme to generate computation-lightweight

   buildings, is a Basidiomycete fungus in the Boletales clade. It owes its
   destructiveness to a uniquely well-developed capacity to colonize by
   rapid mycelial spread from sites of initial spore infection, coupled
   with aggressive degradation of wood cellulose. Genomic methods have
   recently elucidated the evolution and enzymic repertoire of the fungus,
   suggesting that it has a distinctive mode of brown rot wood decay. Using
   novel methods to image nutrient translocation, its mycelium has been
   modeled as a highly responsive resource-supply network. Dry rot is
   preventable by keeping timber dry. However, in established outbreaks,
   further mycelial spread can be arrested by inhibitors of translocation.},

Abstract = {This paper studies lead time flexibility in a two-stage continuous
   review supply chain in which the retailer uses the (R, Q) inventory
   system: when his inventory position reaches R, the retailer places
   orders with size Q to the manufacturer, who uses a transportation
   provider to deliver them with different lead time options. According to
   the contract, the manufacturer is able to expedite or postpone the
   delivery if the retailer makes such a request. Hence, the retailer has
   the flexibility to modify the lead time by using the most up-to-date
   demand information. The optimal lead time policy is found to be a
   threshold-type policy. The sensitivity analysis also shows that R is
   much more sensitive to the change of lead time than Q, and thus, the
   paper is primarily focused on finding optimal R. We also provide a cost
   approximation which yields unimodal cost in R. Furthermore, we analyze
   the order crossing problem and derive an upper bound for the probability
   of order crossing. Finally, we conduct an extensive sensitivity analysis
   to illustrate the effects of lead time flexibility on supply chain
   performance and discuss the managerial insights.},

   performance. In Industry 4.0 era, a cyber-attack becomes unavoidable and
   needs to adopt cyber supply chain risk management to improve the firm.
   The data were collected from 105 firms in Malaysia through online

   technique examined the model's goodness and research hypothesis. The
   results revealed that operations, directly and indirectly, influence
   (via mediators) supply chain performance. In contrast, governance
   directly affects supply chain flexibility and indirect (via mediators)
   influence on supply chain performance; in addition, systems integration
   did not, directly, and indirectly, influence supply chain performance.
   This framework indicates the manufacturing industry and related parties

Abstract = {The balancing of demand and supply in the market is complex because of

   design of the CBNs model is developed and proved that the CBNs model can
   reasonably explain events using predictive performance measurement and

   primarily focused on humanitarian operations, with researchers adapting
   established supply chain methodologies to improve humanitarian disaster
   response. While this has benefited humanitarian organizations in their
   ability to respond to disasters with greater efficiency, it also
   clarifies that there has been little research done on humanitarian
   development, the overlooked part of humanitarian operations. This
   finding suggests the need for future research to focus on the role that
   humanitarian development plays in reducing future social and economic

Abstract = {Due to industrialization and informatization of the construction
   industry, prefabricated construction has attracted wide attention from
   both research and practitioner communities. In prefabricated
   construction, there are exacting requirements for information sharing.
   Also, data in a prefabricated component supply chain tend to be
   dispersed in design, production, transportation and other stages. In
   other words, such data are significantly multi-source heterogeneous.
   Without an effective way of participating in supply chain dynamic
   collaboration, decision-making at various stages and resource allocation
   can be extremely challenging. This paper proposes a decision support
   framework for prefabricated component supply chain based on ontology and
   multi-agent. The framework comprises the ontology layer (i.e. provides
   data support for the model), the agent interaction layer (i.e. serves as
   the communication hub to coordinate the data transmission between
   modules), and the agent simulation layer (i.e. simulates interaction
   behavior of participants, and supports decision making). Using the
   Shanghai Chenxiang Road Station complex project as a case study, the
   paper demonstrates the validity of the proposed ontology and multi-agent
   based decision support framework.},

Abstract = {Recently, crossdocking techniques have been successfully applied in
   responsive supply chain management. However, most researches focused on
   physical layout of a crossdock, or scheduling operations within a
   crossdock. In this paper, we study a multi-crossdock transshipment
   service problem with both soft and hard time windows. The flows from
   suppliers to customers via the crossdocks are constrained by fixed
   transportation schedules. Cargos can be delayed and consolidated in
   crossdocks, and both suppliers and customers have specific hard time
   windows. In addition to hard time windows, customers also have
   less-restrictive time windows, called soft time windows. The problem to
   minimize the total cost of the multi-crossdock distribution network,
   including transportation cost, inventory handling cost and penalty cost,
   can be proved to be NP-hard in the strong sense and hence efficient
   heuristics are desired. We propose two types of meta-heuristic
   algorithms, called Adaptive Tabu Search and Adaptive Genetic Algorithm,
   respectively, to solve the problem efficiently. We conduct extensive
   experiments and the results show that both of them outperform CPLEX
   solver and provide fairly good solutions within realistic timescales. We
   also perform sensitivity analysis and obtain a number of managerial

Abstract = {Purpose The paper identifies the antecedents and consequences of
   integrated supply chain performance (ISCP) in healthcare systems.
   Design/methodology/approach Based on a review of the literature
   constructs of supply chain flexibility (SCF), employee relationships
   (ERs), organizational orientation (OO) and knowledge exchange (KE) were
   identified as antecedents of ISCP, and patient centricity (PC) emerged
   as its consequence. This structural relationship was tested using
   partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings
   ERs, SCF, OO and KE positively impacted the performance of an integrated
   healthcare supply chain. Furthermore, enhanced ISCP in operational
   processes of the hospital positively influenced patient centeredness and
   care quality. Research limitations/implications Paper contributes by
   identifying antecedents and consequences of ISCP. Future researchers may
   explore the inter-relationships among the antecedents of ISCP. Practical
   implications Insights from this study will help practitioners in
   enhancing hospital operations by integrating processes along the
   healthcare service supply chain and developing a patient-centric
   approach. Social implications This paper highlights how PC may be
   achieved by focusing on a facilitative internal environment. This
   understanding may help in designing processes that deliver health as a
   social good in an effective manner. Originality/value The empirical
   evidence from this study can help hospitals integrate their functions,
   thus, enabling them to deliver quality care.},

Abstract = {In manufacturing supply chains with labour-intensive operations and
   processes, individuals perform various types of manual tasks and quality
   checks. These operations and processes embrace engagement with various
   forms of paperwork, regulation obligations and external agreements
   between multiple stakeholders. Such manual activities can increase human
   error and near misses, which may ultimately lead to a lack of
   productivity and performance. In this paper, a multi-agent
   cyber-physical system (CPS) architecture with radio frequency
   identification (RFID) technology is presented to assist inter-layer
   interactions between different manufacturing phases on the shop floor
   and external interactions with other stakeholders within a supply chain.
   A dynamic simulation model in the AnyLogic software is developed to
   implement the CPS-RFID solution by using the agent-based technique. A
   case study from cryogenic warehousing in cell and gene therapy has been
   chosen to test the validity of the presented CPS-RFID architecture. The
   analyses of the simulation results show improvement in efficiency and
   productivity, in terms of resource time-in-system.},

Abstract = {A surge in tariffs poses an enormous challenge to the development of
   multinational green supply chains, which could be mitigated by
   altruistic preferences and government subsidies. By developing a
   Stackelberg game analytical framework and designing different scenarios,
   we deduce the stakeholder's optimal solutions in each case and compare
   them to evaluate the impact of manufacturer altruistic preferences and
   government subsidies on the multinational green supply chain under
   dynamic tariff. Then we show that: (i) with the increasing tariff rates,
   either altruistic preferences or government subsidies can promote the
   green supply chain. (ii) No matter what strategy adopts in the supply
   chain, it is beneficial to the retailer while harmful to the
   manufacturer with altruistic preference. (iii) Government subsidies or
   altruism preferences will lead to free-riding, but the former is
   conducive to the stable supply chain. (iv) Compared with the production
   cost subsidy, the green R\&D subsidy encourages the green level, but the
   former contributes to increasing the participant profits. (v) Subsidies
   and altruistic preference, which simultaneously work in the supply
   chain, will further boost the greening but aggravate the manufacturer's
   loss and destroy the supply chain stability. To further enhance the
   green level and the participant revenue, we also propose the contracts
   of two-part tariff and profit-sharing to coordinate the supply chain.
   Lastly, we perform a comparative analysis of the different scenarios
   utilizing numerical examples and formulate managerial insights
   accordingly.},

Abstract = {Recovery of the industrial waste heat is a cost-effective and
   environmentally friendly approach for the energy supply in cities. The
   industrial waste heat supply chain is a typical multi-objective
   closed-loop system that aims at optimizing both the economic and
   environmental benefits through proper operations during supply,
   purchase, distribution, and consumption. Different from conventional
   waste heat recovery (WHR), the mobile waste heat recovery (M-WHR)
   implanted recovery vehicles to facility heat collection and
   distribution. As a new and cost-sensitive channel for the WHR industry,
   the dynamic supply chain of the M-WHR has seldom been studied. This
   study proposed a numerical model to investigate such a dynamic system
   and conducted a case study to verify the models. The results suggested
   that by optimizing the production plan based on the market demand, the
   supply chain can reach the Pareto state and minimize its production cost
   and idle production recourses. The results of the designed numerical
   examples verify the robustness of the operation strategy. Also, with
   proper government subsidies, the investment in constructing the WHR
   supply chain is profitable and the payback period can be reduced. (C)

Abstract = {This study explores a performance measurement system for a dynamic
   supply chain partnership in a cross-cultural context. An initial
   framework is constructed by reviewing the existing literature, followed
   by an in-depth case study in the Chinese automotive industry, where the
   framework is refined to address the multi-cultural setting. A
   performance measurement, system which includes the relationship strategy
   and operational measurement criteria for a supply chain partnership, has
   been developed. The relationship strategy contains elements of strategy
   orientation, management style, interdependence, mutual organisational
   characteristics and common goals. The operational measurement criteria
   consist of commitment, trust, communication behaviour, information
   sharing, participation decision, quality, production performance,
   delivery, cost, supplier strength, attitude, compromise and loyalty. The
   last three operational measurement criteria are found to be particularly
   relevant to the cross-cultural feature. While existing studies tend to
   focus on either specific measures or individual organisations, this
   paper for the first time proposes a comprehensive framework to measure
   the performance of supply chain partnerships. The cross-cultural
   perspective provides a further unique view on how a performance
   measurement system can be responsive to the dynamics in practice.},

Abstract = {This article discusses how supply chain information capabilities are

Title = {Ripple effect mitigation capabilities of a hub and spoke distribution
   network: an empirical analysis of pharmaceutical supply chains in India},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {In this study, we focus on ripple effect mitigation capability of the
   Indian pharmaceutical distribution network during disruptions like
   COVID-19 pandemic. To study the mitigation capabilities, we conduct a
   multi-layer analysis (network, process, and control levels) using
   Bayesian network, mathematical optimisation, and discrete event
   simulation methodologies. This analysis revealed an associative
   relationship between ripple effect mitigation capabilities and network
   design characteristics of upstream supply chain entities. Using
   stochastic optimisation and Lagrangian relaxation, we then find ideal
   candidates for regional distribution centres at the downstream level. We
   then integrate these downstream locations with other supply chain
   entities for building the network optimisation and simulation model to
   analyse overall performance of the system. We demonstrate utility of our
   proposed methodology using a case study involving distribution of N95
   masks to `Jan Aushadhi' (peoples' medicines) stores in India during
   COVID-19 pandemic. We find that supply chain reconfiguration improves
   service level to 95.7\% and reduces order backlogs by 10.7\%. We also
   find that regional distribution centres and backup supply sources
   provide overall flexibility and improve occupational health and safety.
   We further investigate alternate mitigation capabilities through
   fortification of suppliers' workforce by vaccination. We offer
   recommendations for policymakers and managers and implications for
   academic research.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a multitiered dynamic supply chain network
   equilibrium modeling framework in which the decision-makers have
   sufficient information about the future and seek to determine their
   optimal plans that maximize their profits over the multiperiod planning

   governing the equilibrium of the multiperiod competitive supply chain
   network. The model allows us to investigate the interplay of the
   heterogeneous decision-makers in the supply chain in a dynamic setting,
   and to compute the resultant equilibrium pattern of product outputs,
   transactions, inventories, and product prices. We then establish the
   supernetwork equivalence of the multiperiod supply chain model with a
   properly configured transportation network, which provides a new
   interpretation of the equilibrium conditions of the former in terms of
   paths and path flows. This framework offers great modeling flexibility
   so that, for example, transportation delay and/or perishable products
   can be easily handled, as we also demonstrate. Numerical examples are

   management},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {464-487},
Abstract = {Purpose - A trade-off exists between product variety and supply chain
   (SC) performance. To help mitigate the impact on SC of increased product
   variety, the purpose of this paper is to examine how variety management
   activities including variety management strategy (VMS), supplier
   partnerships and close customer relationships affect SC flexibility and
   agility at different levels of customisation.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey-research methodology is employed
   using data from 363 manufacturing firms from the UK and South Korea. In
   particular, cluster analysis and structural equation modelling were used
   to evaluate the proposed model according to the level of customisation.
   Findings - The results suggest that internal variety management strategy
   and external SC integration have a positive influence on SC flexibility
   and agility. Customer relationships and variety management strategies
   influence SC flexibility more than partnerships with suppliers whereas
   variety management strategies and partnerships with suppliers influence
   SC agility more than customer relationships. In fact, for external
   integration in particular, customer relationships influence SC
   flexibility (i.e. reaction capability) rather than agility (i.e.
   reaction time) whereas partnerships with suppliers influence SC agility
   rather than flexibility. In a high-customisation context, close customer
   relationships are the most effective way to increase SC flexibility,
   whereas partnerships with suppliers are the most effective way to
   increase SC agility. In a low-customisation context, a VMS and customer
   relationships are the most effective way to increase both SC flexibility
   and agility.
   Originality/value - This paper suggests key variety management
   activities to aid managers to better manage product variety ambitions in
   SC under varying customisation profiles through internal and external
   approaches.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how packaging postponement
   can be effectively leveraged in a dynamically changing diverse retail
   market where responsiveness is key. The study also guides about the
   empirical evaluation of how packaging postponement affects the
   performance in the sanitary pads supply chain by considering operating
   measures. The focal company belongs to the Indian Fast Moving Consumer
   Goods sector, hygiene products category. It examines the measures that
   are critical to a responsive supply chain and presents a comparative
   analysis of selected measures before and after implementation. The
   findings illustrate that the packaging postponement not only improves
   competitive advantage but also significantly contributes to improving
   product proliferation and supply chain responsiveness. The study
   provides understanding of drivers and obstacles for packaging
   postponement strategy with operational insights about `how-to'
   implement. Most of modelling-based research studies justify the adoption
   of postponement through savings in inventory only and underplay on other
   operating measures. While justifying, studies emphasise
   `form'/manufacturing aspects and underestimate the packaging aspects of
   postponement. This paper addresses these gap areas by systematically
   highlighting prerequisites and demonstrates the benefits of adopting a
   packaging strategy to handle variety and responsiveness in an emerging

Title = {Supply chain partners and configuration selection: An intuitionistic

Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {3642-3649},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The concept of a supply chain exists for over twenty years but partners
   and configuration selection process still is rather unstructured. In
   order to increase value in any supply chain, a more comprehensive and
   integrative approach is required to select the right partners and
   establish the right configuration along the chain. Under economic
   growth, wrong decisions does not jeopardize profitability dramatically.
   However, recent economy downtrends has made the choice of suitable
   partners in the dynamic supply chain a key strategic concern. The nature
   of these decisions usually is complex and unstructured. This paper aims
   to present an intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral operator based
   approach to partners and configuration selection. In order to bring
   structure in the evaluation process, the supply chain operations
   reference (SCOR) model developed by Supply Research Council is employed.
   The paper discusses the development of the value chain concept from

Abstract = {Due to the increasing uncertainty and diversity in supply chains (SCs),
   companies are aiming to develop their SC flexibility, which we define as
   the capability of a company, both internally and externally in
   conjunction with its key suppliers and customers, to respond to
   uncertainties and customer expectations without excessive costs, time
   and performance losses. SC flexibility has three dimensions - internal,
   supplier and customer flexibility. This study investigates how SC
   flexibility improves operational and financial performance from the
   organisational capability perspective. The conceptual model is
   empirically tested using data collected from 216 companies in China. Our
   findings suggest that only customer and internal flexibility contribute
   to operational performance directly, while supplier flexibility
   contributes to operational performance only indirectly through internal
   flexibility. The three dimensions of SC flexibility have no direct
   impacts on financial performance. We further identify complementarities
   between supplier and customer flexibility and tradeoffs between supplier
   and internal flexibility. However, no synergy effect is found for
   internal and customer flexibility on operational performance. This study
   provides a framework to understand SC flexibility from the
   organisational capability perspective and identifies the
   inter-relationships among the three dimensions of SC flexibility and
   operational and financial performance.},

Abstract = {By increasing advances in the production networks planning,
   understanding of relations and dynamics of production networks is
   gaining more attention in order to use all network capabilities. To
   achieve this understanding, it is not only important to have a good
   understanding of individual firm's manufacturing flexibility next to
   supply chain flexibility, but also to consider the internal (among
   production network's facilities) and external (other tiers of supply
   chain) relationships in a production network. Studying the production
   network's flexibility dimensions facilitates the effective use of the
   synergy of cooperation in the network. On other words, the potential in
   the network structure cannot be exploited unless the planning and
   control of network consider the available flexibility of network and
   operationalize the opportunities which arise. This paper identifies
   different dimensions of flexibility in a production network and
   describes how they can support firms in responding to customers' needs.
   This research employs exploratory and descriptive approaches and uses a
   single case study of Norwegian diary to capture the dynamics of
   production networks. Three product categories with different network
   characteristics are selected, and the identified network flexibility
   dimensions are investigated for these products. The status of case

Volume = {36},
Number = {4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent years, rapid development of information technology (IT) has
   forced companies to integrate tightly with their supply chain partners,
   enabling efficient information sharing between supply chain members and
   improving supply chain efficiency, in order to make their supply chain
   more flexible and efficient. IT therefore plays a critical role in
   supply chains. How to achieve higher organizational performance through
   IT in a complex and uncertain supply chain environment has become an
   important issue. Even though many practitioners and scholars have taken
   multiple points of view to investigate the effects of IT infrastructure
   capability on firms' performance, little research has explored
   cause-and-effect relationships from the perspective of supply chain
   capabilities. Based on a resource-based view of the firm, this study
   develops a research framework for investigating the mediating role of
   supply chain capabilities in the relationships between IT infrastructure
   flexibility, integration, and firms' performance. Data for the study
   were collected from 270 companies in the Taiwanese electronics industry
   and the relationships proposed in the framework were tested using the
   Partial Least Squares method. The results indicate that IT
   infrastructure integration and flexibility indirectly and positively
   impact organizational performance through the mediating effect of supply
   chain capability, and the mediating effect is a full mediation. The
   findings provide empirical support to resourced-based IT studies, which
   propose mediating IT impacts on organizational performance. This study
   should be useful to practitioners who implement IT strategy.},

Abstract = {As a disruptive and innovative technology, blockchain will significantly
   revolutionize how organizations produce and operate as global rivalry
   intensifies. The global COVID-19 outbreak, combined with the growing
   complexity of supply chain networks, has exposed supply chains'
   vulnerability to disruption. Therefore, improving the supply chain
   viability is the primary way to deal with the risk of supply chain
   disruption. Using the method of literature research, this conceptual
   paper systematically reviewed and sorted out relevant literature,
   extracted corresponding capabilities, and put forward relevant research
   propositions. From the perspective of the resource-based view and
   resource-dependent theory, this study investigates specific dimensions
   of the blockchain-enabled supply chain capability: connectivity, network
   capability, and supply chain reconfiguration and the impact of external
   resource-dependent capability on the viability of the supply chain. The
   propositions show that the blockchain-enabled supply chain capability,
   and external resource-dependent capability will positively impact supply
   chain viability. It is expected to assist supply chain firms in

Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART E-JOURNAL OF
   PROCESS MECHANICAL ENGINEERING},
Abstract = {Due to the competitive market, the organizations look for performance
   improvement in their supply chain activities. Lean principles aim to
   reduce waste, and many research works have explored their effectiveness
   in the supply chain. Yet, industries face the problem of selecting
   appropriate lean supply chain management practices for their present
   environment. The present study performed a detailed literature study to
   identify majorly adapted lean supply chain management practices and
   generalize the most important ones with lesser implementation issues.
   For this purpose, the multi-criteria decision-making approaches, namely,
   gray relational analysis and complex proportional assessment of
   alternatives, are used to rank the identified lean supply chain
   management practices. Principal component analysis was used to generate
   criteria weights for computations. Out of 28 selected lean supply chain
   management practices from the literature, seven high-priority lean
   supply chain management practices are recommended as a generalized list
   as a result of prioritization by multi-criteria decision-making
   approaches such as total quality management, just-in-time production,
   pull system/kanban, 5S, information technology, work standardization,
   and customer relationship management. This study will benefit the

Abstract = {This article aims at studying the strategic behaviours of competing
   firms with sticky retail pricing for the product. We base our study in
   the context of a supply chain network comprising multiple manufacturers
   and retailers. The manufacturers are involved in the production of a
   homogeneous product while the retailers purchase the product and sell it
   to consumers in the end markets. The retail price of the product is
   sticky. A differential variational inequality model is proposed to
   handle the multiple agents and their independent behaviours.
   Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the dynamic
   supply chain network with sticky price are shown. A numerical example is
   provided to illustrate the model and the computational results of
   equilibrium behaviour are presented. This paper contributes to
   literature by introducing price stickiness into supply chain networks

Abstract = {The inventory control of substitutable products has been recognized as a

   substitution provides flexibility in supply chain management and
   enhances response time in production control. This paper proposes a

Abstract = {Nowadays, innovation is increasingly growing and the lifetime of
   products is decreasing. In this situation, New Product Development (NPD)
   is an advantage that makes it possible to survive in the competitive
   market. However, risks are unavoidable in NPD in any industry.
   Therefore, identifying, management, and mitigation of risks are
   considered of high significance for companies. By taking risk management
   into account, this study introduces a new multi-objective mathematical
   model for Supply Chain (SC) configuration in the presence of a new
   product. The considered SC is multi-echelon, multi-resource,
   multi-period, and multi-product. In order to manage the risk in this SC,
   appropriate mitigation strategies were chosen among various risk
   response strategies considering their cost and effectiveness.
   Furthermore, influence of each choice on SC was accounted for in the
   mathematical model. The assumed model explored the optimum tactical and
   operational Supply Chain Management (SCM) decisions. The ability of the
   model was assessed by solving a numerical example. The result showed
   that the choice of various response strategies as well as new product
   production influenced SC configuration. (C) 2020 Sharif University of

   develop a multi-objective supply chain partnership integration problem
   by maximizing trustworthiness, supplier service, qualified products rate
   and minimizing cost, and then, apply a hybrid algorithm (PSACO) with
   particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO) that
   aims to efficiently solve the problem. It combines the advantages of PSO
   with reliable global searching capability and ACO with great
   evolutionary ability and positive feedback. By using the actual data
   from 1688.com, experimental studies are carried out. The parameter
   optimizing of the hybrid algorithm is firstly deployed and then we
   compare the problem solution results of PSACO with the original PSO,
   ACO. By studying the partnership integration results and implementing
   analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis, it shows that the event based
   model with PSACO approach has validity and superiority over PSO and ACO,
   and can be served as a tool of decision making for supply chain
   coordination management in business.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative evidence of
   natural disasters' (NDs) effect on corporate performance and studies the
   mechanisms through which the supply chain moderates and mediates the
   link.
   Design/methodology/approach Using two major NDs as quasi-experiment,
   namely the 2011 Japanese earthquake-tsunami (JET) and Thai flood (TF),
   and data over the period 2010Q1-2013Q4, effect of these events on end
   assemblers' performance is studied, with a focus on the personal
   computer (PC) supply chain. The moderating influence of delivery and
   sourcing - as supply chain flexibility and agility - are examined
   through end assemblers' and suppliers' inventory. The suppliers'
   mediating role is captured as disruption in obtaining PC components
   through their sales.
   Findings Only JET had any negative effect, further quantified as
   short-term and long-term. The TF instead portrays an insignificant but
   positive aftermath, which is construed as showing learning from
   experience and adaptability following JET. Inventory matters, but
   differently for the two events, and suppliers only exhibit a moderating
   influence on the assemblers' disaster-performance link.
   Originality/value NDs, as catastrophic vulnerabilities, are distinct
   from other vulnerabilities in that they are hard to predict and have
   significant impact. Since little is known about the impact of NDs on
   firm performance and how supply chain mechanisms moderate or mediate
   their impact, they should be distinctly modelled and empirically studied
   from other vulnerabilities. This paper sheds light on supply chain
   resilience to such events with the role of dynamic capabilities.},

Abstract = {Today's supply chain is becoming complex and fragile. Hence, supply
   chain managers need to create and unlock the value of the smart supply
   chain. A smart supply chain requires connectivity, visibility, and
   agility, and it needs be integrated and intelligent. The digital twin
   (DT) concept satisfies these requirements. Therefore, we propose
   creating a DT-driven supply chain (DTSC) as an innovative and integrated
   solution for the smart supply chain. We provide background information
   to explain the DT concept and to demonstrate the method for building a
   DTSC by using the DT concept. We discuss three research opportunities in
   building a DTSC, including supply chain modeling, real-time supply chain
   optimization, and data usage in supply chain collaboration. Finally, we
   highlight a motivating case from JD.COM , China's largest retailer by
   revenue, in applying the DTSC platform to address supply chain network
   reconfiguration challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {In an automotive supply chain, long production time and demand
   uncertainty lead to major challenges in meeting customer demand. To
   respond to these challenges, automotive supply chain incorporates
   flexibility in the order-fulfillment process through vehicle trades.
   This study focuses on a new category of vehicle trades where dealers
   trade vehicles that are still under production (order-trades) and in the
   delivery phase of the order-fulfillment process (distribution-trades).
   Using empirical data in an experimental design setting, order- and
   distribution-trades are shown to improve flexibility in order
   fulfillment, with no additional costs for the manufacturer. Different
   managerial levers such as trade fees and trade caps are evaluated to
   develop insights for managing vehicle trades. The results show that the
   involvement of the manufacturer in planning order- and
   distribution-trades helps in lowering inventory, reducing lost sales,
   and improving logistics costs for the entire supply chain.},

Abstract = {In 2018, the United States (US) Administration initiated several trade

   In this article, the implications of current and potential US trade

   a projected -0.86 per cent in 2030 (or US\$227.8 billion in 2017
   dollars), as the role of the USA in global supply chains declines
   significantly. China's GDP would also decline considerably by 2.84 per
   cent as a result of the actions imposed against it, while the rest of
   the world gain, as they fill the gaps left by US and Chinese producers.},

Abstract = {Because firms do not operate in isolation, they are bound by the
   structure of the networks in which they are embedded. This structure has
   implications on a firm's ability to access resources and utilize them to
   their advantage. We consider two critical components of this network
   structure: network power and network cohesion. Both of these network
   structures can be critical determinants of firm financial success. Yet,
   to date the extant research has not yet considered the role of network
   relations in the context of Supply Chain Finance (SCF). This manuscript
   attempts to contribute to this gap. Through the use of a dynamic supply
   chain network structure, we test the role that network power and
   cohesion have on a firm's financial performance. The results indicate
   network cohesion contributes positively to efficiency in financial
   performance, whereas power is a critical factor in earnings performance.
   Taken together, the study advances a nuanced perspective of managing the
   firm's levels of network power and cohesion to allow for heightened
   financial performance.},

Abstract = {Multi-echelon inventory optimization literature distinguishes
   stochastic- (SS) and guaranteed-service (GS) approaches as mutually
   exclusive frameworks. While the GS approach considers flexibility
   measures at the stages to deal with stockouts, the SS approach only
   relies on safety stock. Within a supply chain, flexibility levels might
   differ between stages rendering them appropriate candidates for one
   approach or the other. The existing approaches, however, require the
   selection of a single framework for the entire supply chain instead of a
   stage-wise choice. We develop an integrated hybrid-service (HS) approach
   which endogenously determines the overall cost-optimal approach for each
   stage and computes the required inventory levels. We present a dynamic
   programming optimization algorithm for serial supply chains that
   partitions the entire system into subchains of different types. From a
   numerical study we find that, besides implicitly choosing the better of
   the two pure frameworks, whose cost differences can be considerable, the
   HS approach enables additional pipeline and on-hand stock cost savings.
   We further identify drivers for the preferability of the HS approach.

Title = {Analysing the impact of production control policies on the dynamics of a
   two-product supply chain with capacity constraints},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the impact in terms of Fill Rate of
   production control policies in a two-product, two-echelon supply chain
   dynamic problem with production capacity. The factory node is subject to
   two different disruptive occurrences (i.e. failure events and
   changeovers) that can cause unforeseen problems in the supply chain. To
   control these adverse events, the factory can adopt different production
   control policies. We compare the well-known Hedging Corridor Policy with
   two variants, namely Modified Hedging Corridor Policy and Improved
   Modified Hedging Corridor Policy, and Demand-Driven Material
   Requirements Planning policy. Firstly, we use the Response Surface
   Methodology to calibrate the endogenous factors for each strategy. Then,
   through an extended full-factorial Design Of Experiments, we evaluate
   the effectiveness of the production control policies for several
   operational and market scenarios defined by varying exogenous factors.
   Interestingly, our study reveals that the Hedging Corridor Policy
   represents the best rule to increase the Fill Rate. The policies have
   been compared also in terms of indicators related to the factory
   inventory level. The results seem to point out that efficient production
   control policies (measured in terms of operational efficiency) do not
   necessarily yield the best results when measured in terms of supply
   chain efficiency.},

Abstract = {This paper takes up the mathematical modelling and dynamic behaviour of
   a distribution warehouse of a responsive supply chain when subject to
   sudden increases in replenishment lead times, which are dynamic in
   nature. The warehouse is at the downstream end of the supply chain, and
   caters to the demand off-take of the responsive chain. We study
   analytically the effect of large and sudden increases in replenishment
   lead times on the system, and derive the performance behaviour of the
   system, looking at how quickly the system recovers from the disruption
   and is restored to normal operation, with the objective of being able to
   come up with a dynamic control scheme with enhanced performance. We find
   that the conventional dynamic control schemes perform poorly; and we
   therefore propose a modified dynamic control scheme which enhances the
   control and performance of such systems. Additionally, we present a
   comparison of the performance of this system with that of one with zero
   lag and sudden demand increase, which highlights the increased
   difficulty of controlling this system with sudden lags compared to the
   other. Concomitantly, the comparison also highlights the utility of such
   dynamic controls in achieving better performance of the chain under such

   algorithm handles supply networks where capacity investments and product
   flows are decision variables, and the networks are required to satisfy
   product demands. Two features of the slime mould are adopted in our
   algorithm. The first is the continuity of flux during the iterative
   process, which is used in real-time updating of the costs associated
   with the supply links. The second feature is adaptivity. The supply
   chain can converge to an equilibrium state when costs are changed.
   Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the practicality and
   flexibility of the proposed method algorithm.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to systematically review the
   academic literature on Supply Chain Learning (SCL), including the
   definitions, drivers, sources, barriers and consequences of SCL, and to
   propose an integrated conceptual model. Design/methodology/approach A
   systematic literature review has been conducted, with an analysis of 123
   papers in peer-reviewed academic journals published from 1998 up to
   March 2018. Findings Through analysis and synthesis of the literature,
   this paper identifies and classifies the concepts of SCL into four
   types, that is, process orientation, structure orientation, consequence
   orientation and other informal definitions. Based on the Extended
   Resource-Based View (ERBV), the authors develop an integrated conceptual
   framework, which brings together various constructs. Within the
   framework, the authors identify the drivers and sources of SCL at intra-
   and inter-organizational levels. SCL consists of exploratory and
   exploitive learning capabilities, and the outcomes of SCL are dynamic
   supply chain management capabilities and sustainable supply chain
   performance. Originality/value The authors propose a capability
   perspective of SCL and develop a conceptual model and a number of
   associated propositions of SCL based on the ERBV and review findings,
   which is subject to future empirical testing and propose five future
   research directions. The findings of this paper can be extended beyond
   the dyad and be applied in multi-tier supply chain context.},

Abstract = {Given the emergence of innovative processes in recent years for the
   manufacture of bioproducts from second-generation biomass, a range of
   unique biorefinery strategies are likely to be implemented by forest
   product companies in the coming years. No matter what biorefinery
   strategy is employed, to compete in the longer term, it will be critical
   to have a supply-chain adapted to the targeted products. In order to
   meet customer needs and at the same time be cost-competitive, there are
   trade-offs to be made between responsiveness and efficiency in several
   areas of the supply chain, such as production and customer service. This
   paper reviews supply-chain characteristics and competitive factors for
   various bioproducts. An approach that can be used by decision-makers
   during early-stage design is presented, suitable for screening-out less
   promising options based on their supply-chain characteristics.
   Fundamental aspects such as the differentiation of products, their
   possible green advantage, biomass procurement, and process
   characteristics are discussed within five categories: bioenergy,
   biofuels, commodity biochemicals, fine and specialty biochemicals, and
   biomaterials. Several examples of biorefinery strategies are discussed
   to illustrate these concepts. (C) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and

Abstract = {A supply chain needs to consider the quality of a product as well as the
   quality of manufacturing process to satisfy customer requirements at
   efficient resources planning in terms of safety stock allocation and
   vendor-buyer coordination. The objective of this article is to use an
   axiomatic approach to make assembly planning by designing and
   integrating assembly into supply chain planning, particularly during
   supply chain reconfiguration. The effect of fixture layout planning, the
   accuracy of demand forecast, and the supplier capability of providing
   the required material quality are studied. An optimum supply chain
   network is configured by combining the product, assembly, and supply
   chain planning. Heuristic-based optimization is used to validate the
   proposed solution. The performance of the system is measured in terms of
   lead time variability, the number of backorders, and the level of safety
   stock. The results and analysis indicate that the axiomatic approach is
   capable of reducing the assembly variation and employing necessary
   fixture layout planning to deliver product intents. In addition, the
   reduction of assembly variation also reduces the safety stock, lead time
   variability, and backorders. Finally, management decision making is
   discussed among other concluding remarks.},

Abstract = {Perishable foods at undesired temperatures can generate foodborne
   illnesses that present significant societal costs. To certify
   refrigeration succession in a food-supply chain, a flexible,
   easy-to-interpret, damage-tolerant, and sensitive time-temperature
   indicator (TTI) that uses a self-healing nanofiber mat is devised. This
   mat is opaque when refrigerated due to nanofiber-induced light
   scattering, but becomes irreversibly transparent at room temperature
   through self-healing-induced interfibrillar fusion leading to the
   appearance of a warning sign. The mat monitors both freezer (-20 degrees
   C) and chiller (2 degrees C) successions and its timer is tunable over
   the 0.5-22.5 h range through control of the polymer composition and film
   thickness. The thin mat itself serves as both a temperature sensor and
   display; it does not require modularization, accurately measures
   localized or gradient heat, and functions even after crushing, cutting,
   and when weight-loaded in a manner that existing TTIs cannot. It also
   contains no drainable chemicals and is attachable to various shapes
   because it operates through an intrinsic physical response.},

   empirical study in India},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {755-769},
Abstract = {Purpose - Supply chain flexibility has been acknowledged as a necessity
   in the context of constantly changing operational and service
   requirements in the global marketplace. However, limited research has
   focused on analyzing and empirically testing the dynamics of achieving
   enhanced flexibility performance. Drawing upon the knowledge-based view
   of the firm, the purpose of this paper is to address this research gap
   by introducing supply chain learning (SCL) and integration as key
   factors in the process.
   Design/methodology/approach - Survey data were collected in India.
   Structural equation modeling technique was used as the main analysis
   method to test the proposed conceptual model on SCL, integration, and
   flexibility performance.
   Findings - Research findings indicate that the supply chain integration
   construct (in its internal and external dimensions) mediates the
   proposed SCL-flexibility performance relationship. The analysis also
   confirms the positive relationship between cross-functional integration
   and inter-firm integration.
   Research limitations/implications - Focusing on only one country may
   limit the generalizability of the findings. Also, cross-sectional data
   collection may not be the ideal approach for evaluating the impacts of
   SCL. Therefore, future research with longitudinal data and in different
   contexts is warranted to validate the research results of this study.
   Originality/value - The proposed conceptual model adds to the limited
   existing knowledge body of SCL and links SCL, integration, and
   flexibility performance. It also provides a new venue for future
   research in this area.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at designing a sustainable and resilient tire
   closed-loop supply chain network based on a real case study in Iran. To
   immune the network against disruptions, a new resiliency approach is
   proposed by extending efficient demand coverage plans. The developed
   model includes four objectives. The first objective minimizes the total
   costs of the network along with maximizing the coverage of customers'
   demand. As a new concept, the second objective maximizes the operational
   reliability of facilities to extend a consistent and responsive tire
   supply chain. Also, to design a sustainable network, the third objective
   function minimizes CO2 emissions in the strategic and tactical planning
   horizons. Moreover, the fourth objective maximizes the social
   responsibility of the network via introducing new social factors. A new
   mixed fuzzy possibilistic flexible programming method is also proposed
   to handle constraints' violations and parameters' uncertainty. Outputs
   confirm the accurate performance of the extended model and ensure its

Abstract = {Purpose Although the advances in the supply chain resilience (SCR)
   literature, there is a critical gap concerning this understanding in a
   high disruption context, such as in the case of the COVID-19. This paper
   aims to investigate some dimensions (agility, robustness, disruption
   orientation and resource reconfiguration) of the SCR during this
   unprecedented disruption in the Brazilian supply chain context.
   Design/methodology/approach Supported by the resource-based view,
   dynamic capabilities and the SCR literature, we developed a model, which
   in turn was analyzed and validated by partial least squares structural
   equation modelling. Findings The results revealed that while resource
   reconfiguration and supply chain disruption orientation positively
   affect SCR, we found a non-significant effect of supply chain robustness
   and agility. Practical implications The findings suggest that in a
   considerable disruption scenario, managers with their supply chain
   operations in emerging economies should prioritize the development of
   resources to support the disruption orientation and manage the scarce
   resources adequately by reconfiguring them. Originality/value Our study
   is one of the first that reported the dynamics of the SCR dimensions in

Abstract = {Although market orientation (MO) has long been considered an important
   business philosophy, the examination of MO outside the firm's boundaries
   has been rather limited. To address this, this study explores how supply
   chain orientation and operational flexibility (FLX) facilitate the
   implementation of MO. Although the positive impact of MO on firm
   performance has been well established, this study highlights that such
   benefits are enhanced by the development of supply chain related
   capabilities. Results indicate that market-oriented firms are more
   likely to realize the strategic importance of managing the supply chain
   when operating under conditions of high environmental munificence,
   dynamism, and complexity. This provides a better understanding of the
   complex relationship between the demand and supply sides of the firm.
   This study highlights the importance of marketing theory and concepts to
   supply chain management scholars, and vice versa. This further
   accentuates the importance of eliminating the disconnect between supply
   and demand-management processes, also described as the Great Divide
   (Drucker 1973; Esper etal. 2010a,b). A number of key managerial

Abstract = {The paper focuses on the digital platform being the driving force of
   development of the access economy impacting on supply chain business
   model reconfiguration. First, the main accelerators of the sharing and
   access economies were described and compared with the characteristics of
   supply chain architecture. Then, different solutions of the platform
   business model impacting on supply chain reconfiguration are analysed.
   Next the results of a pilot study are presented to illustrate how supply
   chain managers understand the role of digital technologies and
   platforms. The paper is based mainly on a literature review and
   partially on the results of a pilot study conducted at the end of 2018
   among 120 supply chain managers using the CATI methodology. Digital
   platforms can be used to improve supply chain competitiveness in several
   ways - starting from access to logistics services using the outsourcing
   model, through the additional solution of the supply chain business
   model portfolio widening the range of distribution channels, up to the
   digital supply chain solution being a platform connecting the whole
   ecosystem of supply chain stakeholders. The paper has a conceptual
   character, and the proposed solutions are still at the early stage of
   implementation in practice. Therefore, the undertaken topic should be a

Title = {Robust Dual Sourcing Inventory Management: Optimality of Capped Dual
   Index Policies and Smoothing},

Abstract = {Problem definition: How to dynamically replenish inventory from two
   supply sources or shipping modes with general lead times. The fast
   source is more expensive than the slow source. Academic/practical
   relevance: Dual sourcing provides supply chain flexibility to mitigate
   demand and supply risk. Despite its relevance in practice,
   characterizing the optimal dual sourcing policy is extremely
   challenging, and the optimal stochastic policy for nonconsecutive lead
   times has been unknown for over 50 years. Methodology: We present and
   solve a robust rolling horizon model for periodically reviewed dual
   sourcing inventory systems that minimizes the total cost of purchasing,
   inventory holding, and backlogging. Results: We prove that the optimal
   robust policy is a dual-index, dual-base-stock policy that constrains or
   ``caps{''} the slow order and provide closed-form expressions for the
   three control parameters. The optimality result is established for
   general lead times and can accommodate nonstationary demand. Our
   numerical study shows that, as the lead time difference grows, the
   capped dual index policy increasingly smooths slow orders and for
   stationary demand, converges to the tailored base-surge policy, which
   places a constant slow order and has been shown to be asymptotically
   optimal. Managerial implications: Our capped dual index policy is easy
   to understand, explain, and implement in practice. In an extensive
   simulation study, the capped dual index policy performs as well as and
   can even outperform the best heuristics presented in the stochastic
   inventory literature.},

Title = {A systemic approach to assessing energy security in a low-carbon EU
   energy system},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {123},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {335-348},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Until now, the complex relationship between energy security and climate
   change has been addressed using a partial understanding of security, one
   that is based on simplified indicators such as import dependence or fuel
   mix diversity. As a consequence, the synergies and trade-offs between
   climate change and energy security policies have not been systematically
   explored according to a wider understanding of the latter concept. The
   purpose of this article is to resolve the resulting knowledge gap by
   proposing a theoretical approach to energy security that is consistent
   with its multi-dimensional nature, taking into account the whole energy
   supply chain. Five key `systemic' properties of energy security will be
   identified - namely, stability, flexibility, adequacy, resilience and
   robustness. The paper proposes a novel framework to assess energy
   security and uses this framework to develop a comprehensive approach to
   the interactions between climate change policies and energy security.
   The impact of a low-carbon scenario on one of these five properties
   (long-term robustness) will be assessed using a complex multi-regional
   energy system model. The results demonstrate how this scenario induces
   structural changes along the whole energy supply chain, revealing
   dynamic vulnerabilities and trade-offs that are not adequately accounted
   for by existing indicator-based assessments. Finally, the paper provides
   solid foundations for further analysis of these trade-offs using more
   detailed sectoral models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {FACTORS AFFECTING THE LEVEL OF SUPPLY CHAIN PERFORMANCE AND ITS
   DIMENSIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF SUPPLY CHAIN ADAPTABILITY},
Journal = {LOGFORUM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {253-269},
Abstract = {Background: A vital determinant of supply chain performance is its
   adaptability. It is one of essential features that affect the results of
   the functioning of a supply chain. Many researchers indicate
   adaptability as a significant source of acquiring and maintaining a
   long-term competitive advantage, one of major factors that guarantee the
   success of a supply chain, or a major development megatrend of supply
   chains. The main objective of the article is to analyse the impact of
   such factors as industry and applied competitive strategy (cost
   leadership, differentiation, or focus) on the level of supply chain
   performance and results achieved by the supply chain with regard to the
   key aspects of performance in the context of adaptability.
   Methods: In the article the author analyses results of studies conducted
   with CATI method at a sample of 200 enterprises representing four
   industries: automotive, food, furniture as well as consumer electronics
   and household appliances, which are among most advanced sectors in the
   Polish economy (leaders of Polish export). The analysis of data gathered
   was carried out at a few stages. Firstly, a hierarchical confirmatory
   factor analysis was applied. The developed model was used for measuring
   and assessing the performance of supply chains and its dimensions by
   means of designating factor scores. The last stage involved studying the
   impact of such factors as type of industry or applied competitive
   strategy on the level of performance and its four dimensions:
   visibility, velocity, versatility, and responsiveness. At this stage the
   non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used.
   Results: The results of the conducted studies provided evidence that the
   level of supply chain performance as well as its four dimensions is not
   affected by the type of industry, but vary in accordance to the applied
   competitive strategy.
   Conclusions: The model, developed and positively verified in terms of
   quality, may constitute a useful tool for management practitioners to
   measure and assesses the performance of specific supply chains, as well
   as make comparisons between them. Thanks to determining factors that
   affect the level of performance and its four dimensions, managers may as
   well consciously indicate directions in improving supply chains.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {At the same time as the Global Positioning System (GPS) has been applied
   to vehicle tracking and fleet management, other Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICTs) have also been proposed to improve
   supply chain efficiency. Among them, Radio Frequency Identification
   (RFID), and more recently wireless sensors, both currently dominate the
   research literature. However, many of these proposals lack realistic
   architecture, system integration in the supply chain, flexibility and
   cost-efficiency. In addition, several important research gaps need to be
   filled, such as driver identification, automatic management of journey
   schedule and security issues involved in wireless communications while
   collecting data. This paper copes with these issues by: proposing a
   telematic platform of an integral nature, enhancing tracking and tracing
   capabilities for vehicles and goods, giving a secure solution to the
   problem of installing wireless processing units in truck trailers and
   cabs, identifying drivers and journey itineraries, and assuring freight
   environmental parameters during the journey. Hardware and software
   prototypes have been successfully developed and tested in real vehicle
   case studies, including the transportation of agricultural products in

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The paper presents the survey of scheduling problems with the criteria
   based on early and late work. Early and late work corresponds to the
   size of a job executed before and after its expected due date,
   respectively. Since the first survey on late work related criteria from
   2011, a lot of new interesting results have been obtained, which are
   collected in the presented work. They include the complexity analysis
   and proposals of exact, heuristic and approximation algorithms for
   various models with single machine, parallel and dedicated machines,
   extended with additional parameters and constraints such as learning
   effect, machine non-availability, machine eligibility, and setup times.
   The studies on early and late work in the context of online scheduling,
   multi-agent scheduling, Pareto-frontier analysis and mirror scheduling
   are also reported, as well as their applications in supply chain
   management, flexible manufacturing, distributed computing and carbon
   footprint minimization. The relation to the associated models of
   imprecise computation scheduling and scheduling with controllable

Abstract = {Firms are grappling with multiple challenges because of COVID-19, such
   as supply discontinuity, disruptions, irregular demand patterns, and
   service delivery issues, among others. The disruption brought by the
   pandemic has highlighted the relevance of responsiveness and agility in
   service chains in particular. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic,
   however, has made design of agile and responsive supply chains
   difficult, especially for services that draw on intangible, unique
   resources. In this paper, we develop relevant-and thus far largely
   absent-theory for the design of service supply chains through a model of
   service supply chain fit that will guide service firms to prepare better
   for COVID and future threats. Our model guides the identification of the
   right supply chain (responsive, efficient, or agile) for services based
   on their operant resources, which are the intangible resources that act
   on other resources. Using a qualitative study, we first draw on
   service-dominant logic and supply chain fit framework to develop the
   concept of service supply chain fit; that is, the strategic consistency
   between a service firm's operant resources and its supply chain. We then
   validate our model using survey data. The results indicate that service
   supply chain acts as both moderator and mediator for the relationship
   between operant resources and firm performance. Our findings indicate
   that, unless managers view service supply chain fit strategically and
   invest in developing operant resources for the right supply chain,
   future COVID-like disruptions may continue to severely impact firm
   performance.},

Abstract = {An outbreak of deadly COVID-19 virus has not only taken the lives of
   people but also severely crippled the economy. Due to strict lockdown,
   the manufacturing and logistics activities have been suspended, and it
   has affected the demand and supply of various products as a result of
   restrictions imposed on shopkeepers and retailers. Impacts of COVID-19
   are observed ubiquitously in every type of units from different sectors.
   In this study, a simulation model of the public distribution system
   (PDS) network is developed with three different scenarios to demonstrate
   disruptions in the food supply chain. Difficulties have been increased
   in matching supply and demand in a vast network of PDS because of
   changing scenarios with the growth of infected cases and recovery. This
   paper also highlights the importance of a resilient supply chain during
   a pandemic. Our proposed simulation model can help in developing a
   resilient and responsive food supply chain to match the varying demand,

Title = {Flexibility in reverse logistics: a framework and evaluation approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {306-318},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Reverse logistics (or the reverse supply chain) features greater
   relative uncertainty when compared to forward logistics and supply chain
   flows. An effective way to manage uncertainty and variance in
   operational and organizational systems is by introducing greater
   flexibility. The literature on flexibility in reverse logistics is
   surprisingly sparse, with an explicit focus on flexibility in reverse
   logistics nonexistent in the literature. To address this gap in the
   literature, and building upon literature in supply chain flexibility, we
   introduce a reverse logistics flexibility framework. The framework is
   separated into operational and strategic flexibilities. Operational
   flexibility includes a variety of dimensions such as product and volume
   flexibility across various reverse logistics operational functions. We
   have also included strategic flexibility categorized into network and
   organizational design flexibility dimensions. Additional sub-dimensions
   are also included in the framework. The framework is useful for
   practical managerial decision making purposes such as process
   improvement or programmatic evaluation. The framework is also useful as
   a theoretical construct for reverse logistics empirical research. To
   exemplify the practical utility of the framework we introduce a
   performance evaluation of third party reverse logistics providers model
   using a novel neighborhood rough set approach. Using illustrative data,
   sensitivity results help evaluate the neighborhood rough set technique's
   robustness with various reverse logistics performance factors. This
   paper sets the foundation for significant future research in reverse
   logistics flexibility. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Number = {5, SI},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider a dynamic supply chain where a manufacturer
   produces and distributes a featured product through an exclusive
   retailer to end consumers. The manufacturer decides the product quality
   and wholesale price, while the retailer sets the retail price in the
   presence of a revenue-sharing contract and consumers' reference quality
   effects. The objective of this study is to investigate the impacts of
   myopic behaviour regarding the reference quality on the product quality
   and pricing strategies and profits of both members. Our results suggest
   that the manufacturer's myopia leads to a higher quality, higher price
   strategy and a higher quality-price ratio which benefits consumers.
   Meanwhile, relative to the far-sighted behaviour, myopia results in a
   more quality-sensitive but less price-sensitive market demand. What's
   more, we find that the manufacturer is apt to act in a far-sighted way,
   but the retailer isn't always willing to cooperate with a far-sighted
   manufacturer. Taking myopic strategies for both members is likely to
   gain a high profit of the whole supply chain for a relatively high
   marginal contribution of product quality on demand and a relatively low
   revenue-sharing proportion.},

Abstract = {Purpose The implementation of continuous processing technologies for
   pharmaceutical manufacturing has increased due to its potential to
   enhance supply chain flexibility, reduce the footprint of the
   manufacturing facility, and deliver more consistent quality.
   Additionally, it facilitates extensive, real-time monitoring by sensors
   and process analytical technology (PAT) tools without perturbing the
   process. In the presented case study, the use of multivariate tools for
   the real-time monitoring and retrospective review of a continuous active
   pharmaceutical ingredient (API) synthesis was evaluated from process
   development through to commercialization. Method A multivariate
   statistical process monitoring (MSPM) approach summarizing variability
   in both quality critical (controlled flow rates, temperatures) and
   non-quality critical parameters (pressures, pump speeds, conductivity)
   was used to monitor three telescoped chemistry stages of a continuous
   API synthesis. Four different modeling strategies were presented
   addressing specific monitoring and analysis requirements during the
   pharmaceutical development lifecycle. Results During development (R\&D
   and commercial facility), the implemented multivariate monitoring
   resulted in the identification of potential failure modes, a deeper
   understanding of the natural process variability and accelerated root
   cause analysis for a recurrent reagent blockage. During manufacturing
   (commercial facility), the multivariate tool confirmed potential for
   predictive maintenance and early fault detection. Conclusions While the
   implemented control strategy based on parametric control and offline
   analytical testing provided the required quality assurance, the
   multivariate trends provided additional information on process
   performance. More specifically, they enabled more detailed process
   understanding during the development of the continuous API synthesis
   following quality by design (QbD) principles and demonstrated the
   potential for enhanced process performance during commercial
   manufacturing.},

Abstract = {A well-established distribution network is fundamental to the sound
   management of the green supply chain. To adapt to the market demand and
   policies for green products, it is urgent to build an efficient and
   rational logistic distribution network for the green supply chain. Many
   researchers have tried to design distribution networks through the
   coordinated optimization of the green supply chain, in the light of
   realistic situation. However, there are very few optimization models
   that consider all kinds of influencing factors. To solve the problem,
   this paper attempts to establish a coordinated optimization model of the
   complex system of the green supply chain distribution network (GSCDN).
   Firstly, the authors plotted the structure and game logic of the GSCDN
   and defined the upper limit of sales induced by the limited production
   capacity of producers. Secondly, the coordinated optimization conditions
   were configured for the distributor layer, producer layer, and market
   demand layer, and a coordinated optimization model was set up for the
   complex system. Finally, the contractual coordinated optimization
   mechanism was detailed for the complex system under the profit-sharing
   contract. The proposed model and solving algorithm were proved valid
   through experiments.},

   auto sector},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the specific role of
   supply chain capabilities (SCCs) in the implementation of particular
   green strategies and the extent to which this relationship is contingent
   upon firm size.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey-based approach was used to
   empirically test the study hypotheses. Data that were collected from 225
   senior logistics/supply chain managers across the automotive OEM and
   supplier base (predominantly from China, North America and Europe) were
   analyzed using moderated regression analyses.
   Findings - SCCs contribute to effective green strategy implementation
   and their magnitude varies significantly with respect to green design,
   green purchasing and green manufacturing. Firm size has positive
   moderating effects on supply chain flexibility in both green design and
   green purchasing, and on supplier appraisal capability in both green
   purchasing and green manufacturing. However, unexpectedly, firm size
   negatively moderates not only supply chain management (SCM)
   skills/knowledge in both green design and green purchasing but also
   IT/IS support in green manufacturing.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper adopted a cross-sectional
   survey design and was only conducted in the automotive industry which
   may affect the inferences of causality and generalizability beyond this
   sector.
   Practical implications - Managers should consider whether the green
   strategies that they want to follow ``fit{''} with their existing
   resources/capabilities and firm-level conditions, and accordingly
   develop and deploy appropriate SSCs for successful implementation.
   Originality/value - The research contributes to the existing
   resource-based view literature by studying the capability-strategy link
   with its specific application to environmental management.},

Title = {Coordinating contracts for a financially constrained supply chain},
Journal = {OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {72},
Pages = {71-86},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We consider a financially constrained supply chain in which a supplier
   (leader) sells products to a retailer (follower) who has no access to
   bank financing due to her low credit rating. However, the supplier can
   borrow from a bank and offer trade credit to the retailer to alleviate
   her financial constraint. Failure to pay off a bank loan or trade credit
   incurs a variable default cost. We analyze the centralized version of
   the supply chain to obtain new coordination requirements. We then
   examine whether revenue-sharing, buyback, and all-unit quantity discount
   contracts can coordinate our supply chain. We show that the all unit
   quantity discount contract fails to coordinate. However, the
   revenue-sharing and buyback contracts can coordinate the supply chain,
   but only when the supply chain has a sufficient total working capital.
   Moreover, they cannot allocate profit flexibly unless the supplier has a
   large enough working capital. Finally, we design a generalized
   revenue-sharing contract that coordinates the supply chain with flexible
   profit allocation, and also show by numerical examples its superiority
   over the revenue-sharing and buyback contracts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Mitigating supply chain disruptions through the assessment of trade-offs

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {171},
Number = {1},
Pages = {8-21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {One of the central questions in supply chain design is how to properly
   invest in supply chain capabilities in order to be more responsive to
   supply chain disruptions. This new perspective in supply chain design
   requires an understanding of the relationships among costs, supply chain
   risk drivers, and investments in supply chain capabilities. In this
   paper, we develop a multi-objective stochastic model for supply chain
   design under uncertainty and time-dependency. Sources of risk are
   modeled as a set of scenarios, and the risk of the system is determined.
   The objective is to examine the trade-offs among investments in
   improving supply chain capabilities and reducing supply chain risks, and
   to minimize cost of supply chain disruptions. Due to the NP-hard nature
   of the problem, a heuristic algorithm based on a relaxation method is
   designed to determine an optimal or near-optimal solution. To examine
   the efficiency of the heuristic algorithm, a numerical example is
   provided. Our findings suggest that increasing supply chain capabilities
   can be viewed as a mitigation strategy that enables a firm to reduce the
   total expected cost of a supply chain subject to disruptions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the pricing strategy of the manufacturers
   and that of a common retailer, including their after-sale investment in
   a risk-averse supply chain. As the demand is not always for sure, the
   supply chain follows Manufacturers Cooperating (MC) and Manufacturers
   Stackelberg (MS). The main objective of the paper is to investigate the
   influence of the decision parameters such as the after-sale investment,
   wholesale price adjustment speed and risk preference on the stability
   and utilities of the risk-averse supply chain. The dynamic phenomena,
   such as the bifurcation, chaos and sensitivity to initial values are
   analyzed with 2D-bifurcation diagrams, double largest Lyapunov exponent
   and basins of attraction. The study shows that the faster the adjustment
   speed is, the more profits the retailer can make, but on the other hand,
   it is no good to manufacturers. Risk tolerance levels (R-M and R-R)
   affect the utility of the manufacturers and that of the retailer
   differently. A feedback control method is used to control the chaos in
   the supply chain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to assess the effect of implementing Rapid
   Prototyping (RP) in the product development phase on the sustainability
   of a conventional supply chain. The sustainability indicators of RP
   utilization were identified through a critical literature review and
   consulting two experienced RP practitioners to determine the key
   variables regarding the potential impact of RP on the supply chain
   components, with an emphasis on sustainability pillars. A generic system
   dynamics modeling was provided to simulate the RP-adapted supply chain
   and measure its sustainability performance. The simulation results
   indicated that RP utilization in the design phase could decrease the
   number of the assembly parts and material consumption in conventional
   manufacturing, while indirectly affecting the reduction of waste
   generation, logistics, CO2 emissions, processes, and the total costs
   which are related to environmental and economic aspects of the
   sustainable supply chain. Findings indicated that significant increase
   in operational skills and knowledge as the main indicators of the social
   dimension could remarkably reduce the failure rates and increase the
   quality of the products. This indicator plays a pivotal role in
   operational success and could be enhanced through training programs.
   Social sustainability indirectly affects environmental and economic
   sustainability. This was the first model-based research to examine the
   potential effects of RP on the sustainability of a conventional
   manufacturing. The proposed generic model encompassed the variables that
   could be applicable in every scenario to help decision-makers change
   values or add more variables within specific industry settings and
   choose the applicable ones, which in turn, accelerating the RP adoption
   in supply chains and providing insights for operational decisions

Abstract = {Effective data acquisition for business process monitoring has become a
   critical element in today's business world. While the need for
   monitoring is generally agreed upon by both re-searchers and
   practitioners alike, the means and mechanisms are often vague. This is
   especially salient with the fast growing availability of various
   technologies to monitor in real-time through recent advances such as the
   Internet of Things (loT) with specific emphasis on Radio-Frequency
   IDentification (RFID) and associated sensor networks. This study is
   motivated by the lack of published literature in data acquisition and
   analytics that specifically addresses sufficient real-time data
   acquisition for effective managerial monitoring. As a step in addressing
   this void, we review and extend existing literature in this general area
   by studying various requirements and information sources that relate to
   effective management monitoring. We then design an exploratory study to
   evaluate current managerial monitoring needs and the importance of
   automated data collection technologies. Results from this study show
   that the most important latent factor that influences an organization's
   information need is its dynamic competitiveness, and consequently,
   companies with a dynamic supply chain would need a faster transaction
   and operations data system. The second important latent factor is the
   behavioral performance, which renders it essential to have a
   human-centric data system. This study provides evidence for the
   significance in adopting technologies such as RFID and other IoT systems
   for real-time monitoring in highly dynamic organizations and offers
   guidelines for analytical technology adoption for various industries.},

Pages = {1105-1135},
Abstract = {A manufacturing service capability (MSC) model is essential for correct
   communication of MSC information between dynamic supply chain (DSC)
   partners. MSC information elicits service details such as locations,
   specialisations, capacities, certifications, and software and material
   processing capabilities. Presently, as in the case of web portal-enabled
   supply chain communications, this information is communicated using
   models that provide limited semantic precision. These models are also
   proprietary to specific industry communities; hence, access to MSC
   information across communities is limited. This article describes
   deployment of the reference-ontology-based semantic mediation approach
   using Web Ontology Language (OWL). The mediation introduces shared
   semantics that enhances access to and precision of proprietary MSC
   models encoded in relational databases. Detailed deployment steps are
   discussed using a manufacturing sourcing use case. In the first step, we
   analyse three alternative conventions for encoding proprietary MSC
   models into OWL and show that the ontology-oriented encoding convention
   is most suitable for semantic mediation in OWL. In the deployment step,
   single- or multi-community deployment is possible. It is shown that the
   single-community deployment enables precise and greater access to MSC
   information within the community, while the multi-community deployment
   additionally enables interoperable access to MSC information across the
   communities.},

Abstract = {Purpose A literature review conducted for this study showed that
   although different aspects of supply chain flexibility have been
   studied, research on the factors affecting supplier flexibility and the
   impact of supplier flexibility on supplier performance are conspicuously
   absent. The present study aims to fill in this gap in the literature.
   Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research design was adopted.
   Data were collected from 119 manufacturing companies operating in Turkey
   and analyzed by structural equation modeling. Findings The findings show
   that supplier flexibility is associated with environmental uncertainty,
   relationships with the buyer and the quality of information shared
   between the buyer and the supplier, but not with the level of
   information shared between the buyer and the supplier. The findings also
   indicate that supplier flexibility affects supplier performance.
   Research limitations/implications The generalizability of the findings
   can be considered as a limitation. In the future, sector-based
   larger-scale studies are desirable. Also, data can be collected from
   both the main business and suppliers and findings may be compared.
   Practical implications The findings of this study help decision-makers
   to make more informed decisions about information exchange, supplier
   relationships and environmental uncertainties depending on the degree of
   flexibility that they request from their suppliers. Originality/value A
   literature review for this study indicated that there is a lack of
   research on the factors affecting supplier flexibility. Therefore, this
   research is expected to make an original contribution to the literature.},

Title = {Local Resources and Procurement Practices in Humanitarian Supply Chains:
   An Empirical Examination of Large-Scale House Reconstruction Projects},

Abstract = {Different procurement decisions taken by relief organizations can result
   in considerably different implications in regards to transport, storage,
   and distribution of humanitarian aid and ultimately can influence the
   performance of the humanitarian supply chain and the delivery of the
   humanitarian aid. In this article, we look into what resources are
   needed and how these resources evolve in the delivery of humanitarian
   aid. Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, we develop a
   framework to categorize the impact of local resources on the
   configuration of humanitarian supply chains. In contrast to other
   papers, the importance of localizing the configuration of the
   humanitarian supply chain is not only conceptually recognized, but
   empirical investigations are also provided. In terms of methodology,
   this article is based on the analysis of secondary data from two housing
   reconstruction projects. Findings indicate that the use of local
   resources in humanitarian aid has positive effects on programs' overall
   supply chain performance and these effects are not only related to the
   macroeconomic perspective, but benefits expand to improvements related
   to the use of knowledge. At the same time, it was found that local
   sourcing often comes with a number of problems. For example, in one of
   the cases, significant problems existed, which were related to the
   scarcity of local supplies. Both housing reconstruction projects have
   indicated the continuous need for changes throughout the programs as a
   dynamic supply chain configuration is important for the long-term
   sustainability of reconstruction aid.},

Abstract = {We consider a decentralized two-period supply chain in which a
   manufacturer produces a product with benefits of cost learning, and
   sells it through a retailer facing a price-dependent demand. The
   manufacturer's second-period production cost declines linearly in the
   first-period production, but with a random learning rate. The
   manufacturer may or may not have the inventory carryover option. We
   formulate the resulting problems as two-period Stackelberg games and
   obtain their feedback equilibrium solutions explicitly. We then examine
   the impact of mean learning rate and learning rate variability on the
   pricing strategies of the channel members, on the manufacturer's
   production decisions, and on the retailer's procurement decisions. We
   show that as the mean learning rate or the learning rate variability
   increases, the traditional double marginalization problem becomes more
   severe, leading to greater efficiency loss in the channel. We obtain
   revenue sharing contracts that can coordinate the dynamic supply chain.
   In particular, when the manufacturer may hold inventory, we identify two
   major drivers for inventory carryover: market growth and learning rate
   variability. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our results by
   examining a model in which cost learning takes place continuously.},

Abstract = {Supply chain resilience is the key for cross-border e-commerce
   enterprises to continuously obtain competitive advantages. This paper
   studies the influencing factors of cross-border e-commerce supply chain
   resilience (CBSCR), so as to further enhance the competitiveness of
   global supply chain and ensure the safe operation of cross-border
   e-commerce supply chain. Based on the ternary theory of supply chain
   resilience, this paper firstly constructs the CBSCR influencing factor
   system, and then analyzes the comprehensive influence degree, causal
   relationship and logical hierarchy among the influencing factors by
   using the fuzzy DEMATEL-ISM method. The results show that: recovery
   speed of supply chain disruption, response time of supply chain
   disruption, coordination ability among cross border e-commerce partners,
   experience sharing among cross-border e-commerce partners, joint
   planning among cross-border e-commerce partners, establish a good
   enterprise reputation for fairness, risk management team among partners,
   and develop a collaborative culture among partners are the key
   influencing factors of CBSCR. On this basis, it is proposed that the
   adaptability of supply chain is a top priority, which can be started
   from strengthening risk management culture, cooperation among partners
   and construction of supply chain agility.},

Abstract = {Today's scenario of manufacturing and supply chain is full of
   uncertainty because of numerous types of disruptions and failures such
   as fire, storm, machine failure, are a few names. Always supply chain
   disruptions present disastrous impacts, although probabilities of
   happening are low. In the recent robust as well as flexible supply chain
   has captured the focus of researchers in designing a supply chain
   network with consideration of disruption's risk. In this work, an
   ontology-based decision support system is proposed to intensify the
   supply chain resilience during a disruption. The concept of semantic and
   ontology is adopted in developing the knowledge base for the entire
   supply chain network including manufacturing units. Protege is used for
   defining the classes and sub-classes along with numerous types of
   properties and expressed in a rule-based system using semantic web rule
   language (SWRL). Furthermore, a mixed integer linear programming model
   with an objective of maximising quantified resilience to fulfil the
   demand. A hybrid particle swarm optimisation - differential evolution
   (PSO-DE) is utilised as an optimisation technique for the defined
   problem. In performing the study, a set of simulated data is formed and
   then interpreted in the ontology for an optimal selection of recovery

Title = {Managerial strategies for process innovation through the perspective of
   competition among supply chain members},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {296},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {This article considers a dynamic supply chain environment consisting of
   one manufacturer and two retailers. This paper aims to study a retailer
   facing the an upstream (manufacturer) while implementing technology
   innovation and facing another retailer (competitor) in competition in
   the same industry. Specifically, this paper studies how should the
   retailer choose the control strategies to gain an advantage over the
   competition? In the corresponding situations, how should the
   manufacturer optimize its strategies? The paper describes the problem as
   a Stackelberg game between the manufacturer and the retailers and a Nash
   game between the two retailers. Through careful study of analytical
   solutions and numerical cases, the study has drawn some conclusions of
   management significance. First, this paper abstracts the process
   innovation, and creatively characterises the manufacturer's mastery of
   green innovation technology during production through a dynamic process.
   This paper finds that process innovation is the optimal strategy for the
   manufacturer in the long-term operation. Second, the strategy of the
   manufacturer about process innovation is influenced by different
   strategies of different retailers and different market conditions.
   However, the manufacturer will obtain more benefit if the retailer with
   low advertising influence in the same industry occupies the main market.
   Finally, this paper mainly considers the advertising competition between
   retailers. The retailer with low advertising influence should make full
   use of the weapon of advertising publicity to improve its competitive
   advantages in the same industry. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The last four decades have seen an explosion of open architecture
   electronics, computers, social media, modular operating systems,
   sensors, communication links, etc., all based on standardized highly
   certified and cost effective modules provided by a responsive supply
   chain. Virtually no progress of a similar nature for electro-mechanical
   systems (orthotics, aircraft, vehicles, surgery, manufacturing cells,
   etc.) has occurred {[}1]. A companion paper {[}2] on the Next Wave of
   Technology shows that the previous electronics wave was necessary to
   prepare the foundation to this emerging technology to continuously
   enhance performance-to-cost ratios for a very wide range of applications
   that form the core of the discipline of mechanical engineering. Major
   government agencies (especially in Europe and the U.S.) have begun to
   structure their programs on ``popular{''} ideas reinforced by the news
   media. Solid science for a multitude of electro-mechanical applications
   (see the NWT paper) is being displaced in favor of cloud computing, big
   data, neuro-science, nano-science, etc. The result is now becoming
   severe. The weakness of any one technology (in this case, the
   mechanicals) forms a weak link to make the resulting systems of
   technologies weak. The large failed investment of \$30 billion for the
   Future Combat System (FCS) by the Army is proof of this continuing and
   growing imbalance. In this paper, we illustrate this large view
   development objective by concentrating on open architecture vehicles. As
   may be understood, only a portion of the required development can be
   described in this short paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Distributed supply chain network modelling and simulation: integration

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Agent-based distributed simulation is an efficient methodology for
   modelling and analysing such complex adaptive systems as dynamic supply
   chain networks. However, it lacks an acceptable generic standard. Supply
   chain operations reference (SCOR) model is a cross-functional framework
   widely accepted as an industry standard. It provides the standard
   processes, performance metrics, best practices and associated software
   functionalities for modelling, evaluating and improving supply chain
   networks. However, it is a static tool. Integration of agent-based
   distributed simulation and SCOR model can exploit their advantages to
   form a generic methodology for modelling and simulation of a wide range
   of supply chain networks. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology
   for distributed supply chain network modelling and simulation by means
   of integration of agent-based distributed simulation and an improved
   SCOR model. The methodology contains two components: a hierarchical
   framework for modelling supply chain network based on the improved SCOR
   model and agent building blocks integrating the standard processes from
   the SCOR model. The hierarchical framework provides an approach for
   structure modelling in any level with different granularities based on
   the improved SCOR model, and allows rapidly mapping a supply chain
   network into the structure model of a multi-agent system; while agent
   building blocks are quite useful and convenient to fill the structure
   model to fulfil its function modelling. With the approach of structure
   modelling and function filling, not only can the process of agent-based
   supply chain network modelling be accelerated, but also the built models
   can be reused and expanded. Because the hierarchical framework is based
   on the conceptual framework of SCOR model and agent building blocks
   integrate the standard processes from SCOR model, the proposed
   methodology is more generic. In addition, the issues of sub-model
   synchronisation and data distribution management in the agent-based
   distributed simulation implementation are taken into consideration and
   the corresponding solutions for these issues are proposed. Finally, an
   example of a supply chain network is modelled and implemented to
   illustrate the proposed methodology and related solutions.},

Abstract = {Uncertainty and lead time (LT) make supply chain (SC) system present

   the operation of dynamic SC system, a cost optimization strategy (COS)
   and a robust control strategy (RCS) are investigated. A cost model of LT
   reduction is set up through the method of piecewise accumulation, and
   then a COS is designed by the comparison between the LT reduction cost
   and the shortage cost. By considering production LTs and uncertainties
   of the external demand and internal parameter for dynamic SC system, an
   inventory state transition equation and a system cost transition
   equation are developed. Based on the fuzzy control theory, a RCS is
   designed to reduce the interference of uncertainties and LTs to the
   normal operation of the dynamic SC system. Simulation results show that

Title = {Exiting the COVID-19 pandemic: after-shock risks and avoidance of
   disruption tails in supply chains},
Journal = {ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Entering the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on supply chains. Reacting
   to the pandemic and adaptation in the ``new normal{''} have been
   challenging tasks. Exiting the pandemic can lead to some after-shock
   effects such as ``disruption tails.{''} While the research community has
   undertaken considerable efforts to predict the pandemic's impacts and
   examine supply chain adaptive behaviors during the pandemic, little is
   known about supply chain management in the course of pandemic
   elimination and post-disruption recovery. If capacity and inventory
   management are unaware of the after-shock risks, this can result in
   highly destabilized production-inventory dynamics and decreased
   performance in the post-disruption period causing product deficits in
   the markets and high inventory costs in the supply chains. In this
   paper, we use a discrete-event simulation model to investigate some exit
   strategies for a supply chain in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Our model can inform managers about the existence and risk of disruption
   tails in their supply chains and guide the selection of post-pandemic
   recovery strategies. Our results show that supply chains with postponed
   demand and shutdown capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic are
   particularly prone to disruption tails. We then developed and examined
   two strategies to avoid these disruption tails. First, we observed a
   conjunction of recovery and supply chain coordination which mitigates
   the impact of disruption tails by demand smoothing over time in the
   post-disruption period. Second, we found a gradual capacity ramp-up
   prior to expected peaks of postponed demand to be an effective strategy
   for disruption tail control.},

Abstract = {Vector control, particularly distribution of insecticide-treated bed
   nets (ITNs), constitutes one of the major pathways to prevent and reduce
   malaria transmission. ITN distribution campaigns face several
   challenges, such as inadequate funding, budgetary constraints,
   hard-to-reach areas, limited transportation, and market and price
   volatility. While long-term agreements and proper planning can
   effectively overcome such challenges, those options may not be available
   for all humanitarian organizations and governments. To gain a better
   understanding of such tradeoffs we develop a robust optimization model
   that minimize ITN distribution costs while taking into consideration
   protection against financial, market and logistical uncertainties. The
   simultaneous account of such uncertainties is rarely seen on the
   humanitarian supply chain design literature. The proposed robust model
   explores data-driven adaptive uncertainty sets that capture the
   dependence structure among procurement and distribution costs, leading
   to plausible uncertain scenarios. In addition, we develop a hierarchical
   optimization approach to ease the burden of setting a specific
   robustness level for each constraint, when uncertainties are related to
   the independent terms. We study a United Nations Children's Fund ITN
   distribution campaign in Ivory Coast, observing that (1) total costs
   increase with campaign robustness, as expected, and (2) campaign
   robustness comprises of improved supply chain flexibility, which might
   minimize efforts if it becomes necessary to adjust procurement and
   transportation plans when uncertainty arises. In addition, assessing
   robust solutions through Monte Carlo simulations against several
   realizations of uncertain parameter values indicates that, as desired,
   robust plan feasibility increases with the specified level of
   conservatism.},

Title = {Countrywide optimization of natural gas supply chain: From wells to
   consumers},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {196},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {High-profit-margin gas plants are often challenged by low crude price
   and fluctuations in processed natural gas quality and quantities
   demanded by markets. A more challenging factor is the rapid variation in
   the demand of the products across gas supply chain. These challenges
   require high operational flexibility across the supply chain to adapt
   its product portfolio to the market-changes. To this end, optimization
   of the entire supply chain is highly essential to address these pressing
   challenges. This paper details an optimization analysis of a countrywide
   gas supply chain typical to the Middle East region. A unified
   optimization model that encompasses all the supply chain components is
   formulated. The model, in its most general form, comprises of 446
   decision variables and 190 constraints, which is solved using an
   evolutionary algorithm. The key application of the proposed model is
   that it can be used in assessing the optimum allocation of the gas
   across the various layers of supply chain to maximize countrywide total
   profit. The model shows that an increase of 3\% in profit can be
   achieved. The model is also used to predict future gas allocations under
   different scenarios based on fifteen-year profile of gas profiles,
   costs, product yields and contractual terms. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The approach of fossil fuel substitution requires alternative strategies
   in the progressing sector coupling of energy storage, distribution and
   conversion. Promising solutions are flexibly supply chain models of
   green and blue hydrogen which is fed into the natural gas network (HNG).
   Prerequisite for a successful implementation is the functional
   capability of end-use applications for which different volumetric
   hydrogen thresholds are documented in literature. A clear research gap
   is thereby evident for HNG fired medium-speed large-bore gas engines
   typical used for stationary power generation. For solving this problem,
   generic single cylinder tests with focus on operating window, NOx
   formation and hydrocarbon emissions have been carried out. The results
   are analysed and compared to available publications of HNG fired
   high-speed gas engines to derive general insights of the combustion
   characteristics. Under rising blending share, an in literature
   described, general shifting of the possible operating window and an
   increase of NOx formation are detected. In terms of unburned
   hydrocarbons, a NOx-neutral reduction potential through hydrogen
   blending is only visible under very lean operating conditions. This
   result deviates from expected literature values of high-speed engine
   setups. The experimental study demonstrates the NOx neutral combustion
   capability of medium-speed large-bore gas engines under 20\% hydrogen

   will reduce the sale price of cascade utilization products, the recycler
   will increase the wholesale price of high energy density batteries, the

Title = {Remanufacturing configuration in complex supply chains {*} , {*}{*}},
Journal = {OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {101},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The closed-loop dynamics of sustainable supply chains play a key role in
   their performance, as the reverse flows of returns and remanufactured
   products entail new sources of uncertainty that alter the normal
   performance of the supply chain. However most of the studies assume a
   linear supply chain with a single reverse flow of returns, which is a
   simplification that may not hold in most of the existent supply chains,
   which often show more complex structures with several flows of returns.
   When there are several return flows, a critical decision for the supply
   chain dynamic performance is whether the remanufacturing process should
   be centralised (i.e. a single facility jointly remanufactures the
   returns from all the locations) or decentralised (i.e. the
   remanufacturing takes place independently in each location). This paper
   explores the impact of this critical decision on the performance of a
   divergent closed-loop supply chain with several point-of-sales and
   reverse flows. A simulation model is developed considering different
   return rates, information transparency levels, and number of nodes in
   the supply chain. Findings reveal that a centralized configuration
   reduces the uncertainty in the reverse flows of remanufactured products,
   smoothing the production orders of the involved organizations and
   improving their inventory performance. As a drawback, upstream members
   of the supply chain may face a higher uncertainty due to some
   correlation of orders. As such, this configuration may not be
   recommended in long supply chains with a significant number of return
   flows and high average return volumes, unless there is a high
   transparency of information. Furthermore, guidelines for managers are
   provided in order to reduce the bullwhip effect when implementing these
   circular economy practices. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Chain: A Systems Theory Approach},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Featured Application Dynamic supply chains are suitable for the
   mathematical modeling, analysis and control of high-volume manufacturing
   supply chains in which low variability is present, considering a
   cause-effect relation in a deterministic context. The application of
   ordinary differential equations via the mixing problem context is
   addressed. Dynamic supply chains (SC) are important to reduce inventory,
   enable the flow of materials, maximize profits, and minimize costs. This
   research work presents a capacity-inventory management model via system
   dynamics for a dynamic supply SC, applying model-based optimal control
   techniques. In the context of high-volume manufacturing (HVM) that
   present low variability and predictable demand, for mathematical
   modeling purposes, a set of coupled first-order ordinary differential
   equations, with an analogy from the mixing problem, is presented, which
   relates capacity and inventory levels, taking into account a production
   rate at each node of interaction. The application of ordinary
   differential equations via the mixing problem (or compartmental
   analysis) is important based on the idea of a balance between the influx
   and outflux of raw material along the supply chain. A proper literature
   review on optimal control for supply chains is analyzed. The
   mathematical model introduced is presented in a linear time-invariant
   (LTI) state-space formulation. Stability analysis for the dynamic serial
   SC is presented, and a sensitivity analysis is also conducted for the
   capacity and production rate parameters considering the effects of
   variations in parameters along the SC. An energy-based optimal control
   is also developed with proper simulations.},

Title = {The mediating effect of supply chain flexibility on the relationship
   between supply chain integration and supply chain performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Purpose - Supply chain integration (SCI) and flexibility (SCF) are
   recognised as crucial business practices and capability in the global
   competitive market. However, limited research has paid attention to
   study the relationship between SCI, SCF and their impact on supply chain
   performance (SCP). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to establish
   a relationship between integration, flexibility and performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - The structural equation modelling
   technique was used to analyse the 187 data collected from Indian
   organisations through the survey methodology.
   Findings - Findings indicate that external integration contributes
   significantly to realise SCF and SCP. Sourcing and logistics flexibility
   also help to improve the SCP. The mediation analysis showed that the
   association of customer and supplier integration with SCP is partially
   and fully mediated by logistics flexibility, respectively. This study
   suggests that integration influences the SCP when the firm has a strong
   association with downstream partners and enough capability for logistics
   flexibility.
   Research limitations/implications - The study has collected
   cross-sectional data to analyse the relationship between SCI, SCF and
   SCP. However, as integration requires an effort of the years,
   longitudinal data and industry-specific studies may provide
   comprehensive views to validate the results of this study.
   Originality/value - Building on relational view theory and dynamic
   capability theory, the study has proposed the SCP assessment framework
   based on the relationship between SCI and SCF.},

Abstract = {Performance measurement systems (PMS) have commonly been applied to
   evaluate and reward performances at managerial levels, especially in the
   context of supply chain management. However, evidence suggests that the
   effective use of PMS can also positively influence the behaviour and
   improve performance at an operational level. The motivation is to
   accomplish organisational goals, namely to increase supply chain
   flexibility by responding to evermore-varying customer demands in a
   timely manner. The purpose of the study described in this paper was to
   develop a conceptual framework that adopts performance measures for
   ex-ante decision-making at an operational level within the supply chain.
   To guide the research, five questions were asked and subsequently key
   gaps have been identified. In an attempt to fill the gaps, a case study
   at a major global brand beverage company has been carried out, and as a
   result, a conceptual framework of the PMS has been developed. Overall,
   the research offers a foundation of the applicability and impact of PMS
   in the supply chain and provides a framework that attends to some of the
   potential uses of PMS that so far have not been practically applied. The
   outcomes from the testing indicate that the initial gaps identified in
   the literature have been addressed and that the framework is judicious
   with scope for practical applicability. The framework is deemed worthy
   of further testing in different operational contexts of the supply

Abstract = {Building and deploying network capabilities of firms are crucial for
   sustaining competitive advantage. Enterprise resource planning (ERP)
   systems are useful to enhance such network capabilities thorough
   effective information flows. Their intended goals are measured in terms
   of production costs, operational flexibility and supply chain
   performance outcomes. However, the impact of ERP system implementation
   on firm performance has been reported as somewhat inconclusive. This
   study contends that a missing link in the story is the scope and extent
   of ERP system implementation after investigating how the extent of ERP
   integration is associated with the performance outcomes of manufacturing
   firms. The study also posits that restructuring in the organisation and
   supply chains are positively associated with manufacturing performance.
   Since ERP often entails restructuring in an organisation and supply
   chains, it is anticipated that restructuring plays an important role in
   inducing positive impact of ERP implementation to the firm. Using a
   global sample of 641 manufacturers, this research identifies four
   distinct ERP systems integration patterns, epitomised by different
   extents and directions of integration, and finds a significant
   association among the broadest degree of ERP systems integration,
   restructuring and plant performance improvement. The empirical results
   also show that restructuring takes place most actively in a firm that
   implement ERP with widest scope and scale.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {76},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The rapid growth of population in metropolitan areas has put incremental
   pressure on urban cities. The centric strategy towards smart cities are
   expected to cover solution for metropolitan life and ecological
   environment. One of the significant application areas of IoT in smart
   cities is the food industry. IoT systems help to monitor, analyze, and
   manage the real-time food industry in smart cities. In this research, we
   proposed an IoT based Dynamic Food Supply Chain for Smart Cities which
   not only ensures the food quality but also provides intelligent vehicle
   routing as well as tracing sources of contamination in FCM. Furthermore,
   a smart sensor data collection strategy based on IoT is utilized which
   would improve the efficiency and accuracy of the supply chain network
   with the minimized size of dataset and vehicle routing algorithm is
   introduced and tracing the contamination sources of infected food in the
   markets. Our proposed model is evaluated with the comprehensive
   evaluation and used various performance metrics such as tracing
   accuracy, delay, execution time, and traveling time. The results show
   that the proposed system outperforms when compared with existing
   approach.},

Abstract = {In response to environmental protection policies issued by the United
   Nations Environment Program, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have been
   developed. This paper studies the short- and long-term repeated game
   behaviours of two parallel supply chains involving duopoly vehicle
   manufacturers producing BEVs and fuel vehicles (FVs). Taking consumers'
   low-carbon preference and government subsidy scheme into account,
   optimal decisions and comparative analyses under the three game
   strategies of non-cooperative game and cooperative game and cost-sharing
   contract under supply chain coordination have been conducted. In the
   short-term game supply chain, three game models (non-cooperative,
   cooperative and cost-sharing contract) are formulated and three optimal
   decisions are compared. In the long-term repeated game supply chain, the
   dynamic behaviours of two parallel supply chains under non-cooperative
   game are analysed. We uncovered that the prices of BEVs are more
   dependent on the reduction of carbon emissions and government subsidy
   than FVs. In addition to supply chain coordination, consumers'
   low-carbon preference also improves the total profits of the three game
   models. Furthermore, the adjustment speed of the eco-friendly level of
   BEVs has the most significant impact on the vehicle market.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify if and how the
   see-now-buy-now model impacts the traditional buying, merchandising and
   supply chain processes (BMSCP) of multi-brand fashion retailers (MBFR)
   and whether they need to be adapted in order to facilitate this
   development. Design/methodology/approach This exploratory study includes
   three industry case studies, triangulated with external observers. A
   total of 11 semi-structured interviews were conducted within Germany and
   the UK. Findings Findings demonstrate that in order to adopt the
   see-now-buy-now model there is a need for process-shortening, as well as
   better process and network alignment between MBFR and brands through
   agility, supplier-relationship management and vertical integration in
   order to stay competitive against time-based competition. Whilst most
   steps of the traditional BMSCP are still applicable under the
   see-now-buy-now model, they must be re-engineered and shortened, with
   the steps being rolling rather than linear, with buyers and
   merchandisers operating in a more hybrid role. Originality/value This
   paper addresses the lack of research on the see-now-buy-now model as
   well as on the BMSCP of MBFR and the implications that see-now-buy-now
   could have on those processes. A modified buying, merchandising and
   supply chain framework adapted to incorporate see-now-buy-now is created
   which will be useful for academics and practitioners.},

Abstract = {In the era of globalisation, requirements of customer are changing very
   fast. Product life cycle is shortening. Organisations are under pressure
   to reduce cost, delivery time, improve reliability of product by
   changing their process continuously. Supply chain management has become
   integral part of strategy for most of the organisations in meeting these
   challenges. Success of supply chain depends on effective strategy for
   improving coordination among the members to make it more responsive for
   market needs by optimising available resources. In this context, supply
   chain needs to be flexible. Based on the literature, it is observed that
   overall flexibility of supply chain depends upon suppliers' flexibility,
   manufacturing flexibility and customers' flexibility. Other sub-factors
   affecting flexibility may be product and process design, capacity
   planning, logistic management, suppliers' capabilities and nature of
   customers. This study has tried to prioritise flexibility alternatives
   by analytical network process approach. Input for this analysis is based
   on four Indian case studies, which are briefly described in the paper.
   These organisations had been very active in improving flexibility of
   their supply chains. Findings of the study report that organisations
   should give top priority for improving manufacturing flexibility
   followed by customers' and suppliers' flexibility.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {32},
Number = {7-8, SI},
Pages = {446-461},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Previous research describes supplier integration as a competitive
   resource that manufacturers use to create economic rents. Considering
   the mixed results obtained from linking supplier integration with
   performance outcomes, a `dynamic' component - or the ability to
   reconfigure the supply chain to adapt to changing environments - appears
   critical to creating a sustainable competitive advantage. This study
   identifies integration sensing, seizing and transforming as
   sub-capabilities that together form a dynamic capability, referred to
   herein as supplier integrative capability (SIC). That is, SIC enables
   buyers to sense changes in the supply environment by sharing information
   with suppliers, seize opportunities presented by establishing procedures
   to analyse this information and make long-term changes to existing
   processes. A global sample from the industrial sector reveals that the
   three capabilities exhibit complementarity and must exist simultaneously
   for the capability to be effective, which then enhances both process
   flexibility and cost efficiency and helps firms avoid the traditional
   trade-off of cost and flexibility. In addition, market and technological
   dynamics strengthen the effect of SIC on operational performance; supply
   base complexity attenuates this link. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Managers' risk perception of supply chain uncertainties},
Journal = {INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {120},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1617-1634},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper provides a practical framework for managers to
   develop a sustainable supply chain. Given that rapid globalization has
   increased supply disruption risk, managers have been forced to establish
   efficient and responsive supply chain strategies. Nevertheless, diverse
   uncertainty factors, such as risk perception of strategies, have made
   practical management difficult. Quantifying managers' risk perceptions
   and applying them to supply chain strategies allows the authors to
   propose a structural and practical model for managing supply disruption.
   Design/methodology/approach The existing structural model is refined by
   taking subjective factors into account using the analytic hierarchy
   process. The applicability of the refined model is demonstrated through
   a comparative case study. Findings Managers' risk perceptions vary not
   only among companies but also between managing divisions within a
   company, which necessitates possible changes in strategy due to
   environmental turbulence. The principal component analysis (PCA)
   characterizes managers' risk perceptions that illustrate companies'
   emphases on disruption risk. Practical implications The proposed
   approach quantifies risk perception, which enables practitioners to deal
   with subjective information in quantitative form. Comparative studies
   clarify differences in perception given different business backgrounds.
   The results provide managers with in-depth insights for establishing
   supply chain strategies reflecting their risk perception.
   Originality/value Quantification of managers' subjective risk perception
   clarifies both the trend and the individual features for uncertainties.
   The results allow the authors to conduct the PCA, which characterizes
   companies. Comparative studies generalize the results of extant work,
   shedding light on cross-sectional differences given different business
   backgrounds. The effectiveness of the approach is confirmed through
   retrospective interviews with practitioners.},

Abstract = {An ambitious 10-year collaborative program is described to invent,
   design, demonstrate, and support commercialization of integrated
   biopharmaceutical manufacturing technology intended to transform the
   industry. Our goal is to enable improved control, robustness, and
   security of supply, dramatically reduced capital and operating cost,
   flexibility to supply an extremely diverse and changing portfolio of
   products in the face of uncertainty and changing demand, and faster
   product development and supply chain velocity, with sustainable raw
   materials, components, and energy use. The program is organized into
   workstreams focused on end-to-end control strategy, equipment
   flexibility, next generation technology, sustainability, and a physical
   test bed to evaluate and demonstrate the technologies that are
   developed. The elements of the program are synergistic. For example,
   process intensification results in cost reduction as well as increased
   sustainability. Improved robustness leads to less inventory, which
   improves costs and supply chain velocity. Flexibility allows more
   products to be consolidated into fewer factories, reduces the need for
   new facilities, simplifies the acquisition of additional capacity if
   needed, and reduces changeover time, which improves cost and velocity.
   The program incorporates both drug substance and drug product
   manufacturing, but this paper will focus on the drug substance elements
   of the program.},

Abstract = {Less than container load (LCL) is favored by medium and small traders
   because of its ability to promote the flexibility of supply chain. The
   efficiency of LCL cargo transshipment has a great influence on

   analysis method with the aid of SPSS, and takes one port container
   terminal as an example. The results show that the efficiency of LCL
   transshipment at port railway container intermodal terminal is mainly
   controlled by the key factors such as arrival time, loading rate and
   cargo volume, and the order of the index is cargo arrival time, loading
   rate, freight volume, road network ability. The research can provide
   decision support to the development of the LCL scheme for the railway

Title = {Optimal control in dynamic food supply chains using big data},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We consider a dynamic food supply chain with multiple process steps
   where the decisions at each step include supplier selection and settings
   for their process parameters. We assume that the resulting quality level
   of the product at every step is stochastic. We also consider that this
   quality level at each supply chain step has a minimum accepted level and
   any product that does not meet the minimum accepted level is rejected.
   We propose an integrated approach that uses Big Data mining techniques
   to study the effect of these decisions on the quality of the final
   product and determine our state transition matrix. From there,
   stochastic optimization methods are implemented to find an optimal
   policy describing the preferred suppliers and settings for their process
   parameters. The goal of this policy is to maximize the supply chain's
   expected profit and reduce rejected product. We show how this technique
   outperforms traditional techniques in running time as the problem's
   complexity (state and action space size) grows. We also conduct
   experiments to explore how the optimal policy changes as the quality
   threshold for acceptance becomes more restrictive and exhibits a convex
   behavior. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Carbon neutrality and resilience are two of important goals pursued by
   supply chains today. This study seeks to determine how carbon footprint
   reduction (CFR) can be achieved in a resilient supply chain from a
   process integration perspective. Based on contingency theory, we
   employed the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)
   approach to examine the critical influencing factors of process
   integration using evaluations from academic and professional experts.
   Our findings reveal that, first, at the strategic level, supply chain
   collaboration (SCC) and supply chain agility and responsiveness (SCAR)
   have the highest contributions to process integration. Second, process
   and control risks have the highest contributions in supply chain risk
   management; herein, collaborative planning, forecasting, and
   replenishment (CPFR) holds the highest contribution in the SCC,
   visibility and velocity have the highest contributions in the SCAR, and
   supply chain efficiency holds the highest contribution in supply chain
   flexibility (SCF). Finally, CPFR has a significant influence on both
   supplier and customer engagement, with supply chain intelligence
   influencing customer engagement in the SCC. Both the standardisation and
   parallel processes influence supplier spending in the SCF. These
   findings provide a new conceptual framework for empirical research and
   an action plan for supply chains to pursue carbon neutrality.},

Title = {Lean versus agile production: flexibility trade-offs within the
   automotive supply chain},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {56},
Number = {11},
Pages = {3974-3993},
Abstract = {Given the recent dynamics of the automotive industry in the UK, the
   ability for a firm to be flexible has often taken priority over other
   performance indicators. Using the notion of distinct business models and
   trade-offs as our theoretical lens, the purpose of this study was to:
   (1) Distinguish lean and agile firms based upon production methods; and
   (2) Compare lean and agile levels of external flexibility (EF) and
   supply chain flexibility (SCF). Data was obtained from 140 automotive
   firms in the Midlands (UK) via a survey which was sent by emails.
   Findings supported the theoretical notion of trade-offs, as firms
   implementing agile production methods were found to be more flexible in
   comparison with firms implementing lean production methods. More
   importantly, the agile firms that possessed high EF levels and SCF
   levels were predominantly positioned at the lower end of the automotive
   supply chain, whereas the lean firms were largely found to be operating
   at the top of the supply chain. First, we provide an innovative way in
   which lean and agile firms can be conceptualised. Second, as flexibility
   levels were assessed on actual numerical values, as opposed to using
   opinion based Likert Scale questions, a methodological contribution is
   made. Third, as flexibility is in its infancy stage of theoretical
   development we make an empirical contribution by developing a taxonomy
   that distinguishes each production concept. Finally, given the supply
   chain position to where lean and agile firms were found, we invoked a
   power perspective better understand this phenomenon.},

Title = {Impacts of adaptive collaboration on demand forecasting accuracy of
   different product categories throughout the product life cycle},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {415-433},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to empirically analyze how adaptive
   collaboration in supply chain management impacts demand forecast
   accuracy in short life-cycle products, depending on collaboration
   intensity, product life-cycle stage, retailer type and product category.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors assembled a data set of
   forecasts and sales of 169 still-camera models, made by the same
   manufacturer and sold by three different retailers in France over five
   years. Collaboration intensity, coded by collaborative planning
   forecasting and replenishment level, was used to analyze the main
   effects and specific interaction effects of all variables using ANOVA
   and ordered feature evaluation analysis (OFEA).
   Findings - The findings lend empirical support to the long-standing
   assumption that supply chain collaboration intensity increases demand
   forecast accuracy and that product maturation also increases forecast
   accuracy even in short life-cycle products. Furthermore, the findings
   show that it is particularly the lack of collaboration that causes
   negative effects on forecast accuracy, while positive interaction
   effects are only found for life cycle stage and product category.
   Practical implications - Investment in adaptive supply chain
   collaboration is shown to increase demand forecast accuracy. However,
   the choice of collaboration intensity should account for life cycle
   stage, retailer type and product category.
   Originality/value - This paper provides empirical support for the
   adaptive collaboration concept, exploring not only the actual benefits
   but also the way it is achieved in the context of innovative products
   with short life cycles. The authors used a real-world data set and
   pushed its statistical analysis to a new level of detail using OFEA.},

Title = {Delay-in-payments - A strategy to reduce carbon emissions from supply
   chains},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {170},
Pages = {636-644},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to study the effects of various scenarios
   of delay-in-payments (a form of trade credit) by a buyer after receiving
   items, while including various costs such as fuel cost, the costs of
   carbon emissions from manufacturing and transportation activities, order
   cost, and setup cost in a two-echelon coordinated supply chain. The
   model developed optimizes the environmental and economic performance of
   a supply chain. The study presents a comparison of different scenarios
   through numerical examples and sensitivity analyses. The main
   contribution of this paper is the joint consideratioh of
   delays-in-payments, and the costs of transportation cost, and carbon
   emissions. The model has been tested with numerical examples, and
   sensitivity analyses. The findings showed that adopting
   delays-in-payments improves both environmental and economic performance
   of a supply chain. The analyses also showed that optimizing one of the
   parameters from the production rate, the length of delay-in-payments or
   the lot size provides the optimal solution for carbon emissions and the
   system cost of a supply chain. This flexibility makes the model easy to
   use by practitioners. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Continuous manufacturing technologies in upstream pharmaceutical supply
   chains: Combining engineering and managerial criteria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {298-312},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in upstream pharmaceutical
   supply chains (PSC). One is that the global supply of active
   pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is overly dependent on few locations
   and large-scale batch manufacturing. Regulators hope to enable more
   dependable location decisions and improved processing quality with the
   adoption of advanced technologies such as process intensification
   through continuous manufacturing (CM). Conceptual work suggests that the
   benefits of shifting from batch to CM accrue end-to-end across the PSC.
   Yet detailed quantitative information about CM is limited at an early
   stage of evaluation, and too specialised to inform managerial decisions
   about PSC reconfiguration. Supply chain and engineering criteria are
   rarely combined in the early-stage evaluation of alternative CM
   technologies. Extant CM research typically overlooks implications for
   supply chain managers. To address the current gap, this article
   evaluates, at an early stage of adoption, alternative CM reactor
   technologies for the synthesis of APIs in selected therapeutic areas.
   With evidence from secondary data, relevant technologies and criteria
   are identified, and their relative importance is evaluated in a
   semi-quantitative fashion following analytical hierarchy process (AHP)
   principles, ensuring that findings are intelligible to both engineers
   and managers. The proposed empirical work enriches previous conceptual
   frameworks predicated on volume-variety considerations. Specifically,
   findings suggest that, all things considered, microreactor technologies
   outperform alternatives. However, PSC managerial considerations
   introduce nuances in specific therapeutic areas, for example, antivirals
   where a tension between complex chemistry and the need for flexibility
   in unit operations may favour batch manufacturing. For analgesics the
   need to exploit the existing manufacturing base whilst addressing
   inventory reduction favours technologies that incorporate elements of
   batch and CM. The proposed analysis is in line with real-world decisions
   that global medicines manufacturers are increasingly facing, as
   governments seek to develop local health countermeasures to the COVID-19
   pandemic in the absence of detailed information.},

Number = {10},
Pages = {1298-1310},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Increasing occurrences of natural disturbances, including windstorms and
   high snow cover, and supply chain risks lead to severe irregularities in
   wood harvest and transport. To overcome resulting supply difficulties,
   innovative multimodal systems via rail terminals are promising options
   offering the potential to increase buffer capacity, improve supply chain
   resilience, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, a train
   terminal is included in a virtual simulation environment spanning the
   entire wood supply chain from forest to industry to test, analyze, and
   evaluate a complex multimodal system in different scenario settings.
   Furthermore, the simulation model provides intuitive decision support
   through animation and a cockpit of key performance indicators,
   facilitating hands-on workshops with supply chain managers. Results show
   the advantage of a combination of unimodal and multimodal transport in
   the wood supply chain of the observed case-study region. This
   combination proves to be resilient and outperforms other tested supply
   chain strategies by avoiding both bottlenecks and ill-timed plans and
   reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Furthermore, workshops
   conducted with industry experts indicate that adapting collaborative
   supply chain control strategies by means of a participatory simulation
   environment enhances the development of advanced risk management and
   therefore improves supply chain resilience, efficiency, and
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {A reasonably constructed dynamic model of an urban water supply network
   is the building block for the operation, simulation, reconstruction,
   expansion and planning of a water supply network. A dynamic model of the
   water supply network was built in Ma'anshan City, Anhui Province, China,
   which could offer science-based operations for attaining high
   efficiency, low cost water supply networks that foster both economic and
   social benefits. The model was designed consisting of 3 water sources,
   977 pipe sections and 863 nodes. After that, a hybrid optimization
   algorithm combined algorithms based on a chaos optimization algorithms
   (COA), a genetic algorithms (GA) and a Davidon-Fletcher-Powell (DFP)
   variable metric algorithm was employed for the precise verification of
   both the nodal flow quantity and pipeline friction coefficients. The
   results showed: 1) that the guaranteed rate of <1.0 mH(2)O absolute
   error of pressure measurement was 84.62\%; 2) that the guaranteed rate
   of <1.5 mH(2)O absolute error was 92.31\%, and 3) that of <2.0 mH(2)O
   absolute error was 100\%. For the flow quantity measurement, 1) the
   guaranteed rate of <5.0 L/s absolute error was 86.67\%; 2) the
   guaranteed rate of <10.0 L/s absolute error was 93.33\%, and 3) that of
   <20.0 L/s absolute error was 100\%. Judging from the results above, the
   dynamic model was proved to be of sufficient precision. Then the
   simulation analysis was performed on the current status and the planned
   operation of the water supply network in Ma'anshan City, which proved
   the practicability of the designed model.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {230},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Bullwhip Effect manifests itself in the form of an increased order
   and inventory variability in the uppermost nodes of the supply chain.
   This dynamic phenomenon is not yet well understood in closed-loop supply
   chain settings, despite their growing importance in modern societies
   pursuing circular economy opportunities. Indeed, the problem-specific
   literature has provided somewhat conflicting findings. To better
   understand the Bullwhip Effect in closed-loop systems, we obtain
   expressions for the order and inventory variance amplification in four
   archetypes that differ in the structure of information transparency.
   Interestingly, we observe that the impact of return rates and lead times
   on the system performance strongly depend on the degree of supply chain
   visibility. This perspective allows us to revisit discrepancies in prior
   works. We later move the study from the operational to the economic
   prism. Here we prove the existence of an optimal return rate, and we
   derive its expression in the four closed-loop supply chain archetypes.
   We show that the optimal rate is dependent on the node's cost structure,
   the lead times, and the variability of demand. Properties of the
   different closed-loop systems and relevant managerial implications are
   also discussed in our work.},

Abstract = {Environmental disaster and rapid climate change cautioned government
   bodies and environmental protection agencies, which resulted in
   legislations forcing business organizations to restrict their carbon
   emissions to make their supply chain a disaster resilient supply chain.
   In supply chain, carbon emissions are seen light away from the
   procurement of raw materials till the distribution of finished goods
   through logistics. Hence, there is strong need to fix carbon emissions
   and to make existing supply chain an environmentally sustainable supply
   chain to gain environmental disaster relief. This paper primarily
   focuses on minimizing carbon emissions in the raw material procurement
   and its logistics using a cap-and-trade method. In the raw material
   procurement and logistics, the carbon emission is caused during the
   ordering, transporting and holding the procured items from various
   suppliers. The paper aims to model sustainability-resilience link at the
   supply chain design level through the procurement and logistics of raw
   material which is considered as the primary stage of any supply chain. A
   dynamic non-linear mixed integer model featuring an environmental
   sustainability through cap-and-trade method of carbon emission is
   proposed that can be used to design sustainable procurement logistics
   for disaster resilient supply chain management. The proposed model in
   the paper is referred as SPL\_DRSCM (sustainable procurement and
   logistics for disaster resilient supply chain management) and is
   validated through illustrations. Important useful managerial and

Title = {Mediating and moderating influencers of firm performance Supply chain
   managers perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {38-63},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conduct an exploratory study
   that will assist supply chain firms in the development of partner
   satisfaction, flexibility, and supply chain performance. The authors
   examine how the interaction of information exchange, partner
   interaction, knowledge sharing and flexibility as mediated through
   partner satisfaction effectuates firm performance. The goal of this
   research is to answer the supply chain managers' need to better
   understand where to invest their time and effort to get improved firm
   performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - The model was tested with panel data from
   105 experienced, US-based supply chain managers. Structural equation
   modeling using partial least squares approach was utilized to conduct
   the analysis.
   Findings - The results provide crucial evidence that simple information
   exchange among supply chain partners does not result in improvements in
   firm performance or partner satisfaction, but, when mediated through the
   flexibility construct, it does. Further, the use of integration tools
   has a moderating effect on the relationship between flexibility and firm
   performance. The results suggest that working closely with supply chain
   partners helps ensure improved relationship satisfaction, and can reduce
   issues that can impact firm performance.
   Research limitations/implications - The empirical research presented
   requires additional validation though larger sample data from supply
   chain managers.
   Practical implications - This study stresses on the importance of
   managers using information exchange, partner interaction, and knowledge
   sharing as a means of improving their firm's indirect influence on firm
   performance through flexibility and integration tools.
   Originality/value - This is one of the few studies in the supply chain
   literature that integrates flexibility as a mediator variable.
   Additionally, this study introduces the new construct of integration
   tools to the supply chain literature.},

Title = {Exploring the Relationship between Data Analytics Capability and
   Competitive Advantage: The Mediating Roles of Supply Chain Resilience
   and Organization Flexibility},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In today's business environment, data analytics capability has gained
   popularity among organizations as a source of competitive advantage.
   Furthermore, due to the current business outsourcing, supply chain
   management is known to be an extremely challenging task. Most previous
   studies focused on the relationship between data analytics capability
   and competitive advantage regardless of the role of organizational
   characteristics, particularly supply chain resilience. This paper aimed
   to assess the impact of data analytics capability on competitive
   advantage in the textile industry concerning the mediating role of
   supply chain resilience and organizational flexibility. To this end, a
   new conceptual model was developed to investigate the relationships and
   partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied
   for analysis. The population of this study comprised 450 qualified
   persons and four well-known brands of sleep products. In addition, a
   pilot survey was conducted with 30 respondents before the questionnaire
   was used for the final survey. Based on the results, data analytics
   capability positively affected competitive advantage, supply chain
   resilience, and organizational flexibility. Additionally, supply chain
   resilience and organizational flexibility played mediating roles in the
   relationship between data analytics capability and competitive
   advantage. Finally, some management insights are presented that are of
   interest to top managers. However, the results of this study were
   limited to the area of the textile industry (sleeping goods
   manufacturers) in Iran in order to maintain the uniformity of the
   research constructs.},

Title = {Assessing risk in different types of supply chains with a dynamic fault
   tree},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {137},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Supply chain risk analysis is an important field in operations
   management and logistics. Identifying those risks, assessing the
   probability of those risks, and understanding how those risks change if
   mitigation strategies are implemented contribute to better supply chain
   risk management. Reliability analysis has a long tradition of assessing
   the probability of failure, and fault trees are typically used to
   understand how the failure of individual components can lead to system
   failure within an engineered system. More recently, fault trees have
   been proposed to assess the probability of a supply chain failure.
   Dynamic fault trees, which are relatively new in reliability analysis,
   model the dependency among possible component failure and how these
   probabilities change over time. This paper applies dynamic fault trees
   to model supply chain risk for different types of supply chains. The
   dynamic fault tree allows a firm to model complex interactions among
   suppliers and understand how those interactions impact its risk. The
   model incorporates an information system that relays information about
   the status of suppliers to the firm, and this information system could
   also fail. A Markov chain model and Monte Carlo simulation are used to
   numerically assess supply chain risk as modeled by these dynamic fault
   trees.},

Title = {Competitive Pricing and Remanufacturing Problem in an Uncertain
   Closed-Loop Supply Chain with Risk-Sensitive Retailers},
Journal = {ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Nowadays, pricing and remanufacturing problems under uncertain markets
   have gained increasing attention from both industrial and academic
   fields. In the literature, it is generally assumed that all the channel
   members are risk-neutral, ignoring the influences of channel members'
   risk attitudes in the face of dynamic market. This paper focuses on a
   pricing problem in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with two
   competitive risk-sensitive retailers under uncertain environment. The
   uncertainty is associated with the recycling costs, consumer demands and
   remanufacturing costs. Due to the dynamic market, supply chain managers
   may be unable to collect enough historical data to estimate these
   demands and costs when making pricing and remanufacturing decisions. In
   such cases, experts' estimations are usually employed to describe these
   uncertain parameters. To deal with these human estimations, an
   uncertainty theory-based model is proposed. Based on the equilibrium
   results, how the retailers' risk sensitivity and human estimations
   (uncertain degrees) affect the prices and profits is analyzed. It is
   found that both the retailers will get lower profits while the
   manufacturer will gain more profit when either of the two retailers
   becomes more risk-averse. We also find that a higher level of
   uncertainty in the supply chain will induce a higher collecting rate.},

Title = {An advanced buyback contract and information asymmetry},
Journal = {ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel advanced buyback (ABB) contract to
   coordinate a supply chain that consists of one supplier and one
   retailer. The contract stipulates when a buyback contract is executed
   and the amount of buyback. We model the interaction of supply chain
   participants as a Stackelberg game and incorporate the participants'
   reservation profits into the game to examine the effectiveness of the
   ABB contract with complete information. We demonstrate that the ABB
   contract can conveniently coordinate the supply chain, flexibly allocate
   profit, and facilitate avoidance of the aggressive overordering behavior
   of the retailer. This model is extended to the situation of information
   asymmetry, where the retailer holds private information about the cost
   of sales in discrete or continuous states. The optimal strategies of the
   supply chain and the participants are derived. Information asymmetry can
   damage the supplier but be beneficial to the retailer. The condition
   under which the supply chain achieves coordination is clarified. A
   numerical simulation is performed to verify and extend the results of
   the theoretical analysis. We show that the ABB contract always
   outperforms the ordinary wholesale price and buyback contracts with
   complete information. Supply chain coordination is more likely to be
   achieved if the demand variability is lower when weighing whether to
   share private information. Our findings can explain why retailers always
   have an incentive to inflate their cost of sales.},

Volume = {139},

Abstract = {This paper studies the setting in which a one-of-a-kind production (OKP)
   firm offers two types of orders (due-date guaranteed and due-date
   unguaranteed) at different prices to the sequentially arriving
   customers, who are also OKP production firms. The prices for two types
   of orders are quoted to each customer on its arrival. We study two
   problems in this setting. First, we model a dynamic pricing strategy
   (DPS) and compare our DPS with a constant pricing strategy (CPS).
   Through a numerical test, we show that both the firm and its customers
   are better off when our DPS is employed, so that the DPS improves
   overall performance of the supply chain. Through an industry case, a
   custom window production firm, we show how to apply the proposed DPS
   when products are complex. We also develop a method to adaptively
   estimate the firm's available capacity, the number of future arrivals
   and the distributions of the customers' willingness to pay and
   impatience factor. The simulation result shows that, when multiple
   distribution parameters are unknown, the proposed parameter estimating
   method results in estimates close to the true values. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {An Approach to Assess Sustainable Supply Chain Agility for a
   Manufacturing Organization},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Worldwide business organizations realize that agility of sustainable
   supply-chain is a requisite need for survival in a dynamic, competitive,
   and unpredictable market. The contribution of this research is to
   explore and evaluate sustainable agility in supply chains for a dairy
   manufacturing organization located in Saudi Arabia. Other contributions
   of this research are to update the literature about the different
   factors contributing to achieve agile supply chain, propose conceptual
   framework and assessment approach incorporating the relationships
   between sustainable supply-chain capabilities, enablers, and attributes,
   and shortlisting the agility barriers and how they would facilitate
   manufacturing organizations' performance. The paper presents supply
   chain agility evaluation approach, which covers identification of agile
   supply-chain capabilities and drivers. It also presents a conceptual
   model and a framework to define agility level and barriers within the
   supply-chain. In the paper, fuzzy logic approach is preferred, owing to
   its capability to incorporate and deal with problems involving
   impreciseness and vagueness phenomena. Threshold-value in this study for
   the case organization is set to 0.24829. The outcome of the adopted
   approach indicates that 21 attributes performed below the threshold
   value; these attributes are further categorized as agility barriers.
   These are the barriers within their supply chain that impact the
   agility-level. For the case organization, the foremost priority is to
   enhance maintainability and serviceability to make it flexible and
   inexpensive to establish an agile responsive supply chain. At the same
   time, it should have priority to focus on development and integration of
   their core competencies to deal with cross-functional and
   cross-enterprise issues in supply chain. For the case organization, the
   agility level was found ``very agile,{''} although it is below the
   ``extremely agile.{''} Thus, a study was developed to understand the
   behaviour of the supply chain agility and assess/evaluate it to support
   decision makers in order to develop a strategic solution for different

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {230},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We consider financing and coordinating issues in a supply chain with one
   supplier (she) and one manufacturer (he), where the supplier is
   capital-constrained and her production yield is random. Facing shortage
   of capital, the supplier may use two financing sources to facilitate her
   production: bank loan from a commercial bank, or advance payment from
   the manufacturer. Taking the supply chain with centralized control as a
   benchmark, we analyze the optimal decisions of the two members in the
   supply chain. We find that in the optimal decisions, the supplier
   chooses only one, instead of a combination, of the two financing
   sources, and the manufacturer is always willing to pay in advance to
   finance the supplier's production. Furthermore, we propose to use the
   pay back contract (as well as cost-sharing contract as an extension) for
   the manufacturer to share the production risk and stimulate the supplier
   to improve the production yield. Finally, assuming the bargaining
   process of the supplier and the manufacturer being a Nash bargaining
   game, we show that the pay back contract under the two sources of
   financing (bank loan and advance payment) can coordinate the supply
   chain and flexibly allocate the total profit in the supply chain.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the current context characterized by turbulent market conditions and
   the increasing relevance of sustainability requirements, reconfigurable
   manufacturing systems (RMSs) offer great potentialities for supply
   chains and networks. While plenty of contributions have addressed RMSs
   from a technological and system-specific perspective since the
   mid-1990s, the research interest for the strategic potentialities of
   RMSs at the supply chain level is recent and mainly related to building
   supply chains' resilience and sustainability. Despite the interest,
   methods to support supply chains to strategically exploit RMSs are still
   missing, while being highly needed. In this paper, a method-consisting
   of an index to assess machines reusability and a mixed integer
   programming (MIP) algorithm-is provided to support the identification of
   reusable and reconfigurable machine candidates at the early stage of the
   strategic network design. The overall method allows machines to be
   compared based on their reusability and geographical locations. The
   application of the method, as well as an example referring to the
   production of emergency devices during the COVID-19 pandemic are
   reported. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are
   also discussed, and, among others, strategic parameters related to
   machines have been identified and elaborated as enablers of supply chain
   reconfigurability; the proposed method supports practitioners in
   improving supply chain resilience and sustainability. The method also
   encourages practitioners towards the development and adoption of
   reconfigurable machines. Finally, this study also has social impacts for
   local communities and stimulates customer-centric collaboration among
   companies belonging to similar industries and sectors.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the underlying
   mechanism through which firms can achieve supply chain agility and
   augment business performance from the vendor's perspective.
   Design/methodology/approach Drawing on dynamic capability view and
   contingency theory, the study conceptualizes a moderated mediation model
   to investigate the underlying influence of process integration (PI),
   supply flexibility and product-related complexity on supply chain
   agility and the subsequent effect of supply chain agility on firm's
   business performance. Survey data from a sample of 148 firms, in the
   garment manufacturing industry, in Pakistan were analyzed using partial
   least square methods. Findings The results revealed that supply
   flexibility (i.e. volume and mix) mediates the effect of PI on supply
   chain agility. Supply chain agility, in turn, influences a firm's
   business performance. Furthermore, the competence-capability framework
   is not consistent across the varying degrees of product complexity such
   as product complexity hinders the effect of supply flexibility on supply
   chain agility, whereas it amplifies the impact of PI on supply chain
   agility. The conditional indirect effects suggest that the indirect
   effect of PI on supply chain agility through supply flexibility becomes
   stronger when product complexity is high. Originality/value The study is
   novel in the context of an emerging economy to educate fashion vendors
   to tune their competencies and capabilities to regain the market share
   in the global market place.},

Title = {Supply chain redesign implications to information disruption impact},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {232},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Over the years, supply chain reconfiguration decisions have been solely
   based on operational risk. Simplification strategies, such as horizontal
   mergers, and networking strategies, such as risk pooling, are
   conflicting paradigms that have been shown to improve financial
   performance of supply partners. The implication of this to disruption
   risk is not fully known, especially as it concerns information security
   breach (ISB). Analysts have rated ISB as a huge disruption risk, costing
   businesses millions of dollars. Using a credible and well-established
   agent-based simulation approach and statistical analysis, we examine the
   impact of ISB on the simplification and risk pooling strategies
   respectively under three different order replenishment systems. The
   effect of reconfiguring the supply chain is first examined in a
   non-security breach scenario and then in a breached scenario. We find
   that reconfiguration has no benefit to a supply chain using a parameter
   based replenishment policy (option I), in both breach and non-breach
   situations, but leads to significant advantage when batch ordering model
   (option II) or a combined batch-and-parameter based ordering policy
   (option III) is used. We also established that batch ordering system
   favours the risk pooling strategy whereas a combined batch-and-parameter
   ordering system favours the simplification counterpart especially when
   the simplification is at the wholesaler tier. This study has significant
   implications for supply chain design as well as information security
   priorities. This is one of the first papers to look at how ISB impacts
   supply chain configuration and the role of ordering decision context.},

Abstract = {Driven by the policy imperatives of mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions and improving energy security, an increasing proportion of
   global energy demand is being met by nonfossil energy sources. The
   socioeconomic and environmental benefits of replacing fossil fuels with
   bioenergy are complex; however, debate continues about issues such as
   best practices for biomass removal, stable supply chains, and GHG
   mitigation. With the greatest biomass per capita in the world, Canada
   could play an increasing role in the future of global bioenergy and the
   emerging bioeconomy. This paper reviews the utilization of feedstock
   salvaged after natural disturbances (fire and insect outbreaks) to
   supply wood-based bioenergy, by addressing the following
   multidisciplinary questions: (1) How much salvaged feedstock is
   available, and what are the uncertainties around these estimates? (2)
   How can sustainable practices to support increased removal of biomass be
   implemented? (3) What are the constraints on development of an
   integrated supply chain and cost-effective mobilization of the biomass?
   (4) Is the quality of biomass from salvaged trees suitable for
   conversion to bioenergy? (5) What is the potential for climate change
   mitigation? In average, salvaged feedstock from fire and insects could
   theoretically provide about 100 x 10(6) oven Dry ton (ODT) biomass per
   year, with high variability over time and space. Existing policies and
   guidelines for harvesting of woody biomass in Canadian jurisdictions
   could support sustainable biomass removal. However, uncertainties remain
   as to the development of competitive and profitable supply chains,
   because of the large distances between the locations of this feedstock
   and available processing sites. Another uncertainty lies in the time
   needed for a benefit in climate change mitigation to occur. A flexible
   supply chain, integrated with other sources of biomass residues, is
   needed to develop a cost-efficient bioenergy sector.

Abstract = {Enterprises in an industrial cluster could dynamically alliance in the
   form of cluster supply chains to share inner-cluster resources and
   services, and respond to the ever-fluctuating customer demands in a
   cost-effective way. However, an effective and feasible method enabling
   such dynamic cluster supply chain configuration,(CSCC) lags behind
   practice due to the conflict of interests. Researchers are designing
   All-in-One theoretic models to optimize CSCC with the assumed decision
   details of all enterprises, while in fact clustered enterprises are
   seeking effective decentralized decision mechanisms which protect their
   decision autonomy in the frequently re-configured CSC. A newly emerged
   multi-disciplinary optimization method, Augmented Lagrangian
   Coordination (ALC), which supports the open-structure collaboration with
   strict optimization convergence, is thoroughly investigated in this
   paper and applied to solve the conflict. Through a complete analysis of
   CSC's configuration policies in typical stages, a generic CSCC model is
   proposed and then partitioned into an ALC-based decentralized decision
   model by the typical decision autonomy distribution in clusters.
   Clustered enterprises collaborate vertically and laterally along the ALC
   model through multi-dimensional couplings to achieve the overall
   consistency and optimality. Results have proved the effectiveness of ALC
   for CSCC problem. A set of sensitivity analysis is also conducted to
   find out the condition in which an order has to be fulfilled in a CSC
   and the most appropriate configuration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {A dissolved air flotation (DAF) system upgrade was proposed for an urban
   paper mill to recycle effluent. To understand the influence of operating
   variables on the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   and water consumption, a dynamic supply chain model was linked with life
   cycle assessment (LCA) to produce an environmental inventory. Water is a
   critical natural resource, and understanding the environmental impacts
   of recycling water is paramount in continued development of sustainable
   supply chains involving water. The methodology used in this study
   bridged the gap between detailed process models and static LCA modeling
   so that operating variables beyond discrete scenario analysis could be
   investigated without creating unnecessarily complex models. The model
   performed well in evaluating environmental impacts. It was found that
   there was no single optimum operating regime for all environmental
   impacts. For a mill discharging 80 cubic meters of effluent per hour
   (m(3)/hour), GHGs could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 17.5
   m(3)/hour, while water consumption could be minimized with a DAF
   capacity of 25 m(3)/hour, which allowed insight into where environmental
   trade-offs would occur. The study shows that more complexity can be
   achieved in supply chain modeling without requiring a full technical
   model. It also illustrates the need to consider multiple environmental
   impacts and highlights the trade-off of GHG emissions with water
   consumption in water recycling. The supply chain model used in this
   water treatment case study was able to identify the environmental
   trade-offs from the operating variables selected.},

Abstract = {Under the increasing pressure of global emission reduction,
   prefabricated buildings are becoming more and more popular. As
   prefabricated building manufacturers and assemblers are emerging in the
   market, how do they make decisions of pricing, ordering, and emission
   reduction? In this paper, game theory is used to make the decisions for
   the prefabricated building supply chain with flexible cap-and-trade and
   different power structures, i.e., using prefabricated building
   manufacturers as the leader, using the vertical Nash equilibrium, and
   using prefabricated building assemblers as the leader. The two-part
   tariff contract is designed to coordinate the supply chain and to
   improve the supply chain performance. Moreover, we discuss the influence
   of different power structures and the two-part tariff contract on the
   optimal decisions and profits. Finally, numerical analysis is used to
   verify the conclusions. This indicates that the supply chain leaders
   will gain a higher profit and that the power structure has a significant
   influence on the two-part tariff contract, which will result in an
   unfair distribution of profit. High carbon trading prices benefit carbon
   emission reduction. Consumer low-carbon awareness has a positive effect
   on carbon emission reduction and supply chain performance.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {1-35},
Abstract = {Recommender systems have been extensively used by the entertainment
   industry, business marketing and the biomedical industry. In addition to
   its capacity of providing preference-based recommendations as an
   unsupervised learning methodology, it has been also proven useful in
   sales forecasting, product introduction and other production related
   businesses. Since some consumers and companies need a recommendation or
   prediction for future budget, labor and supply chain coordination,
   dynamic recommender systems for precise forecasting have become
   extremely necessary. In this article, we propose a new recommendation
   method, namely the dynamic tensor recommender system (DTRS), which aims
   particularly at forecasting future recommendation. The proposed method
   utilizes a tensor-valued function of time to integrate time and
   contextual information, and creates a time-varying coefficient model for
   temporal tensor factorization through a polynomial spline approximation.
   Major advantages of the proposed method include competitive future
   recommendation predictions and effective prediction interval
   estimations. In theory, we establish the convergence rate of the
   proposed tensor factorization and asymptotic normality of the spline
   coefficient estimator. The proposed method is applied to simulations,
   IRI marketing data and Last.fm data. Numerical studies demonstrate that
   the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of future time
   forecasting.},

Title = {A supply chain framework for characterizing indirect vulnerability},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {184-206},
Abstract = {Purpose - Climate vulnerability assessments are often operationalized by
   the analysis of indicators defined by the spatial boundaries of the
   community under study. These, however, sometimes fail to capture
   interdependency among communities for basic resources. This paper aims
   to propose a framework for characterizing vulnerability caused by
   interdependency by adapting a supply chain lens.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes a definition for
   ``indirect vulnerability{''} that recognizes the transboundary and
   teleconnected nature of vulnerability arising from resource networks
   among cities and communities. A conceptual framework using a supply
   chain approach is presented for climate hazards in particular. This
   approach is then demonstrated through a rapid appraisal of the rice,
   energy and water supply chains and the waste management chains of Metro
   Manila.
   Findings - The application of the supply chain lens to assessing the
   indirect vulnerability of Metro Manila brings to fore issues extending
   beyond the decision-making boundaries of local government units.
   Addressing these will require vertical government coordination and
   horizontal inter-sectoral collaboration. Thus, this supply chain-based
   indirect vulnerability assessment can be complementary to traditional
   vulnerability assessments in providing a larger systems perspective.
   Originality/value - Innovative tools are needed to make community
   vulnerability assessments both holistic and tractable. Existing methods
   in the private sector can be adapted rather than reinventing the wheel.
   This supply chain framework can be a useful decision support and
   planning tool across governance levels to comprehensively address
   vulnerability.},

Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Given the requirements of international businesses, this research
   addresses the supply chain network design problem in the real-world
   situation by considering four critical features: sustainability,
   resiliency, responsiveness, and globalization. For this purpose, a
   multi-objective mathematical model is proposed that minimizes the
   environmental impacts and the total costs and maximizes the social
   impacts while considering the resilience and responsiveness of the
   global supply chain. Then, the modified fuzzy robust stochastic method
   is employed to tackle the uncertainty. This study selects one of the
   most important medical devices during the pandemic (COVID-19) namely the
   blood bank refrigerator as a case study. Afterwards, the proposed
   multi-objective model is solved by developing a novel method named as
   augmented lexicographic weighted Tchebycheff method. Based on the
   obtained results, an increase in the responsiveness level of the supply
   chain can lead to increasing the sustainability dimensions, including
   job opportunities, safety, carbon emission, and economic aspects.
   Moreover, an increase in demands harms the economic, environmental, and
   responsiveness targets. The demand has a pivotal role in selecting
   resilience strategy, as well.},

Pages = {1568-1591},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify and rank the
   contextual relationship among the quality management (QM) constructs for
   manufacturing and its related service organizations providing integrated
   value bundles, which has got limited research attention.
   Design/methodology/approach - The QM constructs of manufacturing and
   services are selected by performing the citation analysis. Studies
   related to manufacturing and service are selected by reviewing their
   citations index in the three major research databases namely ProQuest,
   Scopus and Google Scholar. The subjective responses from both industry
   and academia are taken in order to gain better understanding of the
   contextual relationship among the QM constructs. Finally, an integrated
   model is proposed using Micmac analysis and Interpretive Structural
   Modeling (ISM).
   Findings - The citation analysis lead to identification of 12 QM
   constructs: top management commitment, supplier relationship management,
   human resource management, strategic focus, customer focus, quality of
   information sharing, process management, servicescape, employee
   involvement, service quality, supply chain flexibility and customer
   satisfaction. The expert opinions of executives in the automotive
   industry and academia resulted in the development of contextual
   relationships among the identified QM constructs for the development of
   an ISM model, which is a major contribution of this study.
   Originality/value - The unique focus of this study is on analyzing the
   contextual relationship among QM aspects in manufacturing and services
   as clubbed offering. The researchers in the existing literature have so
   far differentiated between manufacturing and services but this study
   integrates the QM constructs for manufacturing and its associated

Title = {The contingent nature of warehouse flexibility},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Purpose In a volatile marketplace, warehouse management is fundamentally
   contingent of changes in its supply network environment. Flexibility is
   therefore a key logistics issue in distribution centre management. This
   study probes into the nature of warehouse flexibility in a supply
   network through simulation. Design/methodology/approach By using the
   FlexSim simulation tool the dynamic behaviour of the warehouse system
   are conceptualised, documented, simulated, analysed and evaluated.
   Findings Simulation revealed that external changes affect daily
   processes and the reorganisation of warehouse processes. Given the
   extensity of resource use, simulation also revealed that process
   reorganisation should not be a daily undertaking. This is because
   warehouse processes react in unpredictable and different manners to even
   the smallest disturbance from the environment. This reaction is not
   necessarily negative impending more long-term change of warehouse
   processes. Originality/value The warehouse is a complex system that
   self-adapts with limited need to calculate new optimised warehouse
   processes to counter changes in its environment. Rather than following
   deterministic optimisation procedures, the development of flexible
   resources is a key issue in warehouse management. The applied simulation
   model is generic and therefore applicable in other distribution centres
   pointing to how to monitor warehouse processes to in a pre-emptively
   develop warehouse flexibility through change of process context.},

Abstract = {Supply chain systems are becoming more complex and dynamic as a result
   of globalization and the development of information technology. This
   complexity is characterized by an overwhelming number of relations and
   their interdependencies, resulting in highly nonlinear and complex
   dynamic behaviors. Supply chain networks grow and self-organize through
   complex interactions between their structure and function. The
   complexity of supply-chain networks creates unavoidable difficulty in
   prediction making it difficult to manage and control them using a
   linearized set of models. The aim of this article is to design resilient
   supply chain network from the perspective of complex network topologies.
   In this paper, various resilience metrics for supply chains are
   developed based on a complex network theory, then a resilient supply
   chain growth algorithm is also developed for designing a resilient
   supply chain network. An agent-based simulation analysis is carried out
   to test the developed model based on the resilience metrics. The results
   of the proposed resilient supply chain growth algorithm are compared
   with major complex network models. A simulation result shows that a
   supply chain network can be designed based on complex network theory,
   especially as a scale-free network. It is also concluded that the
   proposed model is more suitable than general complex network models for
   the design of a resilient supply chain network.},

Title = {Multiple decoupling point paradigms in a global supply chain syndrome: a
   relational analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},
Number = {11},
Pages = {3051-3065},
Abstract = {A responsive and flexible supply chain in the global product value chain
   set-up links the manufacturer with various inter-company entities, such
   as suppliers, distributors, contract manufacturers and customers to deal
   with volatile demand. It is imperative and prudent to look at the
   overall product chain rather than focusing on any single supply chain
   entity. From a supply chain perspective, it is crucial that these
   individual entities are lean and agile (leagile) themselves, as well as
   the overall product value chain. As a result of the global nature of the
   product value chain, the concept of the decoupling point has undergone a
   paradigm shift. Through the literature review the authors establish
   three different types of decoupling point existing in product value
   chains, namely: (1) product structure decoupling point (PSDP), bill of
   materials decoupling; (2) supply structure decoupling point (SSDP),
   supply network decoupling; and (3) demand transfer decoupling point
   (DTDP), associated with information sharing. It is argued that such
   decoupling points are already an established and accepted phenomena, but
   have not been comprehensively discussed until now. It is proposed that,
   in the global supply chain, PSDP and SSDP are elemental decoupling
   points and DTDP is a logical decoupling, which is a function of PSDP and
   SSDP. It is proposed that DTDP swings between PSDP and SSDP and the
   swing direction is a critical piece of supply chain information that
   helps identify distortion. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) method is
   proposed to discover the relationship of DTDP with SSDP and PSDP using
   interpretation matrices and stress coefficients. Considering the supply
   chain as a fuzzy system, a combined effect of MDS over fuzzy
   applications has been used to determine the extent of swing of DTDP in
   the particular application of the supply chain.},

Title = {Strategic opportunities for product-agnostic remanufacturing},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Purpose There is now much emphasis in both research and practice on the
   principles of circular economies. In this paper remanufacturing is
   examined as a key enabler of circular practices, and the concept of
   ``Product-Agnostic Manufacturing{''} (PAR) is proposed. This work
   differentiates PAR from many traditional approaches to remanufacturing
   by virtue of PAR's treatment of product variety. Most existing
   approaches to remanufacturing feature low variety and standardisation;
   this study instead suggests that the exploitation of flexibilities in
   both operations and supply chains leads to new competitive strategies
   for firms to exploit. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual
   study that builds on a thorough exploration of contemporary
   remanufacturing literature in the development of the new PAR concept.
   Findings Through a detailed literature review it is shown that there are
   a range of benefits, challenges, and critical success factors that
   underpin the remanufacturing concept. Building on this understanding and
   bridging literature in operations flexibility and supply chain design, a
   detailed discussion on the nature of PAR is provided, and an agenda for
   future research developed. Originality/value Whilst there has been much
   literature on remanufacturing, there is a general tendency to treat
   supply chain and remanufacturing operations quite distinctly in
   individual articles. Additionally, there has been little consideration
   of multi-product remanufacturing, and for the limited studies where this
   is done, the emphasis is typically on problem avoidance. This study aims
   to provide a detailed insight into the developed PAR concept, showing
   how the remanufacture of a wide range of product varieties may be
   achieved through flexible operations and supply chain design.},

Title = {Risk Assessment in Supply Chain Networks of China-Pakistan Economic
   Corridor (CPEC)},
Journal = {CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Abstract = {Complexities in today's Supply Chain Networks (SCN) have exposed them to
   various risks, vulnerabilities, and disruptions. Recently, the Chinese
   \$62 billion investment in the wake of the China-Pakistan Economic
   Corridor (CPEC), which includes a network of highways and railways
   projects, will be a milestone for regional connectivity. Through CPEC,
   China aims to connect its north-western province Xinjiang to global
   supply chain networks via Gwadar port Pakistan. Since 9/11, Pakistan has
   become a terrorism stuck state, resulting in the loss of political and
   economic stability, reducing the infrastructure development and Foreign
   Direct Investment (FDI). Under these circumstances, risk assessment of
   supply chain networks in a responsive way toward these problems is
   crucial for authorities. This paper aims to identify and investigate the
   relationship between supply chain risks using the Interpretive
   Structural Modelling (ISM) technique. Additionally, interdependencies
   among risks have been calculated, and classification is done via
   cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC)
   analysis based on corresponding dependency and driving power. Results
   show that political and economic stability has the highest driving power
   and lowest dependence power, indicating that all the risks are directly
   or indirectly associated with it. Simultaneously, epidemics and
   ecosystem changes have the highest dependence power and most
   insufficient driving power, which shows its significant dependency on
   other risks. Finally, based on our model, authorities can design a
   resilient supply chain network responsive to several risks, and
   efficient operations are assured.},

Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {Data visualization is in a process of constant change, the edge is
   constantly expanding, and information can be conveyed with the help of
   graphic technology. This article aims to study the Hainan port logistics
   supply chain and its flexible operation mechanism of digital
   visualization remote control and hopes that through the blessing of
   remote control technology, the port's ability to deal with the external
   environment will be improved. Based on the theory of logistics service
   availability of supply line flexibility, this paper constructs the
   evaluation of Hainan port logistics service supply chain flexibility;
   logistics flexibility refers to the ability of an enterprise to respond
   quickly and effectively to changes in customer demand for
   transportation, delivery, and services. Logistics flexibility includes
   four important elements: logistics supply flexibility, procurement
   flexibility, distribution flexibility, and demand management
   flexibility. Using the concept of two-level planning to build a port
   collection and distribution network optimization model in the supply
   chain environment and analyze related examples to find the best route
   for port transportation, the attributes related to port flexibility are
   selected from the perspectives of strategic flexibility, system
   flexibility, service provider flexibility, and organizational
   flexibility. The test outcomes of this document show the radiation
   capacity of Haikou port is relatively strong, the proportion of people
   who think it is excellent is 60\%, and the proportion of people who
   think that the radiation ability of Haikou Port is good is 20\%. Haikou
   Port has a good resource utilization capacity; 70\% think its resource
   utilization rate is good, and 20\% think its resource utilization is
   very good. Haikou Port's response capability is relatively average
   compared to Kia's capability, and even 10\% of people think that Haikou
   Port's response capability is very average, so Haikou Port needs to
   strengthen training for port response capabilities. According to the
   operating flexibility data, the informatization development of Haikou
   Port is showing a good level.},

Journal = {MANAGEMENT RESEARCH REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},

Pages = {477-508},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The main aim of this paper is to develop a supply chain efficiency
   framework to improve overall business performance in the competitive
   era. This paper offers a critical literature review on supply chain
   efficiency that aims to reveal the basic research that has been carried
   out, the problem areas and requirements for the efficiency in the new
   era of the supply chain.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The methodology followed during this research involves beginning with a
   wide base of articles lying at the supply chain intersection,
   performance measurement topics, and then screening the list to
   concentrate on supply chain efficiency.
   Findings
   Findings show that supply chain efficiency in the modern era remains an
   open research field. This research contributes to the supply chain
   literature by clarifying the supply chain efficiency definition,
   defining key measurements and variables for supply chain efficiency and
   developing a supply chain efficiency framework to improve overall
   performance.
   Practical implications
   This study will be very useful to the scholars working in this field.
   The proposed framework would help researchers and academicians to
   understand every dimension and variable of supply chain efficiency,
   allowing practitioners to measure efficiency levels and identify
   improvement measures. This framework would also act as a comprehensive
   guide for future studies and business practices.
   Originality/value
   As there are several state-of-the-art review papers on various supply
   chain areas, there is a lack of literature available on supply chain
   efficiency studies that can provide a comprehensive framework for
   researchers on related literature. Thus, the present study seeks to
   bridge this gap in the supply chain literature. Also, this study will
   provide a strong basis for researchers and academicians to apply the
   supply chain efficiency measurement system to the dynamic supply chain.},

Title = {Dynamic supply chain coordination games with repeated bargaining},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {12-22},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Coordination in a supply chains may require investment in
   relationship-specific assets (RSA) including information systems and
   human resources from all or a subset of the partners. These investments
   are typically partially non-verifiable, possibly based on internal
   resources or opportunity costs. A supplier offers a single-price
   single-period contract to a downstream manufacturer who accepts or turns
   to a non-strategic outside option. Both parties invest in
   relationship-specific assets (RSA) accordingly. Using a game theoretic
   framework of repeated single-period bargaining under asymmetric
   information and outside options, we show how a supplier may behave
   opportunistically. We show how this rent extraction threat is mitigated
   when the manufacturer mis-informs the supplier or hides information from
   her. As a result of both behaviors, our model explains how supply chain
   coordination and efficiency are impaired. On a normative basis, we
   provide the manufacturer with new justifications for both dual sourcing
   and distorting information. Numerical examples illustrate the results.

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {158},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We study a two-period supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, who
   participates in a cap-and-trade scheme and faces an uncertain emission
   permit price, and a retailer, who sells theproduct from the manufacturer
   to consumer and faces a price-sensitive demand. In the face ofuncertain
   future permit prices, the manufacturer determines the wholesale price
   and pollutionabatement in each period that reduces pollutants per unit
   of output one period later. We modelthe problem as a two-period
   Stackelberg game, obtain a feedback Stackelberg equilibrium,
   andinvestigate the effects of emissions trading on the manufacturer's
   abatement investment, supplychain performance, and social welfare. We
   obtain a revenue-and-cost-sharing contract thatcoordinates the dynamic
   stochastic supply chain. We show that the abatement level increasesin
   the permit price and decreases in its uncertainty. Moreover, the dirtier
   the supply chainis, the less is the effect of permit price and the more
   is the effect of its uncertainty. Boththe manufacturer and the channel
   may benefit from the permit price uncertainty. For a dirtysupply chain,
   a lower price and higher uncertainty intensify the double
   marginalization effect.If the second-period sales revenue is low enough,
   the manufacturer benefits and the retailerloses under the coordinating
   contract. Finally, when the toxicity of pollutants is relatively
   low(high), the effect of emissions trading on social welfare might be
   stronger in a cleaner (dirtier)supply chain.},

Title = {Capacities-based supply chain network design considering demand

Abstract = {The design of a supply chain (SC) aims to minimize cost so the product
   can reach the customer at the cheapest cost with flexible demand. The
   demand of a product is variable with time and environment. Most of the
   researchers have considered investment cost, processing cost, and
   transportation cost as variable costs to minimize the cost while
   considering a constant demand. In actual practice, the demands are
   flexible. In this paper, a two-stage stochastic programming model has
   been proposed for a capacities-based network design of a supply chain
   for flexible demands while considering inventory carrying cost and
   missed opportunity cost in addition to the above-mentioned costs. It
   will enhance the logistic planning and seek the location network
   optimally. Furthermore, in the first stage, decision variables represent
   different nodes (facility locations of echelons) of the supply chain,
   with the assumption that they will be considered at the design stage
   before uncertain parameters are unveiled. On the other hand, decision
   variables related to the amount of products to be produced and stored in
   the nodes of the SC, the flows of materials among the entities of the
   network, and shortfalls and excess at the customer centers are
   considered as second-stage variables. The methodology has been
   illustrated by solving an example. It was found that the proposed model
   yields more feasible and advantageous results.},

Abstract = {Material production drives an increasingly large fraction of
   CO2-equivalent emissions. Material efficiency strategies such as
   recycling serve to reduce these emissions. Current analyses of the
   effectiveness of such strategies do not include economically induced
   rebound effects, overestimating the associated environmental benefits.
   We present a dynamic supply chain simulation model for copper through
   2040 incorporating inventory-driven price evolution, dynamic material
   flow analysis, and life cycle assessment alongside mine-level economic
   evaluation of opening, closing, and production decisions. We show that
   permanent increases in recycling displace similar to 0.5 kilotonnes mine
   production per kilotonne increase in scrap supply on average, while
   short-lived recycling policies can lead to increased mine production. We
   find evidence for supply chain evolution pathways minimizing the rebound
   effect and maximizing displacement of primary material, where increasing
   refined copper and concentrate prices and decreasing demand serve to
   decrease mining. However, even in best-case scrap supply scenarios,
   CO(2)e emissions from the copper sector increase 25\% by 2040 relative
   to 2018 due to demand growth, ore grade decline, and lower displacement
   among large scrap supply changes. With implementation of best available
   technologies across all supply chain components, we estimated 2040
   CO(2)e emissions 10\% below those of 2018 are possible, though still
   well short of 2 degrees C emissions targets. We find increasing mine
   taxes and royalties, reclamation costs, and exploration costs further
   increase displacement, as does the inclusion of scrap prices on major
   futures exchanges. These results highlight the importance of considering
   the economics of the entire material supply chain when implementing
   material efficiency strategies. This article met the requirements for a

Abstract = {Purpose Worldwide, facing increasing resources pressure, more and more
   manufacturing firms aim to circular economy (CE), which is a system
   characterized by the application of remanufacturing principles and
   adoption of sustainable manufacturing practices. The purpose of this
   paper is to investigate the function of remanufacturing capability in
   influencing supply chain resilience in supply chain networks under the
   moderating effects of both flexible orientation and control orientation.
   Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered through a survey
   performed online in South Africa, and 150 participants completed the
   survey. Participants were mainly industry professionals holding senior
   administrative positions. Findings Results indicate that market factors,
   management factors and technical factors positively influence dynamic
   remanufacturing capability (DRC). More specifically, on one hand, market
   factors strongly influence DRC, whereas, on the other hand, both
   management and technical factors influence at lower level DRC. DRC has a
   positive influence on supply chain resilience. Flexible orientation is
   found to positively moderate the effect of DRC on supply chain
   resilience, whereas control orientation does not exert any moderating
   effect on DRC and supply chain resilience. Originality/value This is one

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},

Pages = {212-225},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the impact of lean, resilient and green
   supply chain management practices on supply chain sustainability. A
   deductive research approach was used to derive a conceptual model.
   Eighteen research propositions are suggested and tested with empirical
   data derived from five case studies belonging to the Portuguese
   automotive supply chain. A conceptual model to assess the impact of
   lean, resilient and green practices on supply chain sustainability was
   derived from the data analysis. The practices with significant impact on
   supply chain sustainability are: ``waste elimination,{''} ``supply chain
   risk management{''} and ``cleaner production.{''} The following lean,
   resilient and green supply chain management practices do not have a
   significant impact on supply chain sustainability: ``flexible
   transportation,{''} ``flexible sourcing,{''} ``ISO 14001
   certification,{''} and ``reverse logistics.{''} The paper provides a
   taxonomy for lean, resilient and green supply chain management practices
   at three levels: upstream, organization and downstream. Practitioners
   can use this taxonomy as a checklist to identify possible practices to
   achieve their sustainability goals. The proposed model makes it possible
   for researchers to develop surveys in order to better explore the
   proposed relationships. This paper presents an innovative approach since
   it studies simultaneously the three dimensions of sustainability
   (environmental, social and economic), and the lean, resilient and green
   supply chain management paradigms which are considered strategic for
   supply chain competitiveness. Identification of the conceptual
   relationships between supply chain management practices and
   sustainability is a contribution that the authors hope will become a
   forward step in the development of new theoretical approaches and
   empirical research in the field of supply chain management and
   sustainability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   (WOS) databases and objectively chooses 1,190 articles and performs
   meta-data analyses. Tables and statistical reports are based on the
   following three filters: publication year, authors and document type. At
   least, 39 publications from the ISI WOS has been examined for presenting
   information of categorization of the conducted research with regard to
   the content analysis, comprising the conceptual development and
   obstacles, cooperation with the supply chain elements, as well as
   mathematical and other optimization models. Findings Finally, this study
   answered three main questions in the research and demonstrates that the
   majority studies in the green supply chain (GSC) and a minimum number of
   studies on the cold supply chain have been conducted and 27 factors are
   chosen to achieve the 2000 to 2019 GRACL SCM model which robust and fit
   for Iranian food industries. The model shows that the agile, resilient
   and lean supply chain have direct effect on GSC and it can be said that
   all 27 groups which are selected for the final model of this research
   can be the main groups in the supply chain. Originality/value This paper
   was actually conducted by authors who reported it. To prevent

Abstract = {In this study, a mathematical inventory model for a supply chain system
   made up of a vendor and a buyer under stochastic demand is formulated.
   The vendor serves as a manufacturer who produces items, while the buyer
   serves as a retailer who buys the items from the vendor and sells them
   to end customers. In addition to utilizing regular production as a
   production base, the vendor also uses green production. Green production
   adopts green technology, which comprises environmentally friendly
   inventions that are used to reduce emissions. Green production is more
   costly than regular production, but it generates lower emissions. The
   production rate is adjustable, which enables decision makers to control
   the emissions and production cost. The objective of this study is to
   find the optimal production allocation, ordering quantity, shipment
   frequency, safety factor, and production rate such that the joint total
   cost is minimized. An algorithm is suggested to solve the mathematical
   problems and its application is validated with a numerical example. The
   results show that the changes in the emissions, carbon tax, and
   production cost parameters exhibit significant effects in determining
   the optimal production allocation. Furthermore, by controlling the
   production rate flexibly, the supply chain can lessen the emissions
   released during production and maintain the total cost. Finally, a
   sensitivity analysis is carried out to explain the usage of the proposed
   model.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {182},
Pages = {73-85},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Subsidiaries of manufacturing companies operate as members of two
   distinct networks: the internal manufacturing network of the company and
   the external network of supply chain partners. Adapting the concept of
   ``dual embeddedness{''} from international business literature to a
   manufacturing context, this paper proposes a model explaining the link
   between internal integration, external integration and operational
   performance. An international survey containing data on 470
   manufacturing subsidiaries is used to operationalize the constructs.
   Structural equation modeling provides evidence for a full mediation
   model: external integration mediates the positive impact of internal
   integration on performance. Based on the results, it is put forward that
   knowledge generated within the internal manufacturing network can only
   be converted into subsidiary-level operational performance, if it is
   shared and recombined with external supply chain partners. The highest
   performance benefits can only be achieved if both suppliers and
   customers are involved in this process. A limitation of our approach is
   that knowledge flows are measured indirectly by assessing the level of
   integration of a subsidiary in the knowledge flows within the internal
   network, and the level of integration with suppliers and customers. (C)

Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to examine the effect of inventory information sharing
   on inventory efficiency and its intervening effect of information
   technology (IT) capability in manufacturing firms.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Stratified random sampling and filter questions selected targeted
   respondents, and an online survey collected 124 completed questionnaires
   from Malaysian manufacturing firms. partial least squares structural
   equation modeling (PLS-SEM) examined the structural model and hypothesis
   statement. An analysis of importance-performance map analysis (IPMA)
   test identified the relative importance drivers of inventory efficiency.
   Findings
   The findings showed that enhanced IT capabilities in manufacturing firms
   mediate a positive relationship between inventory sharing and inventory
   efficiency.
   Research limitations/implications
   This study portrays the relationship between inventory level, demand and
   information sharing. The research was carried out only within Malaysian
   manufacturing firms.
   Practical implications
   These findings will enable the management of manufacturing firms to
   design and visualise their inventory levels and share best practices
   across supply chain networks to achieve effective and optimised
   inventory planning.
   Social implications
   This study illustrates an intervention model that offers a direct and
   indirect impact of IT capabilities that allow scholars to close
   inventories productivity gaps in research.
   Originality/value
   This paper extends the limited literature on the sharing of inventory
   information and inventory productivity, notably from a strategic
   management perspective. The findings help scholars clearly understand
   the information systems capability and its mediating impact on
   information sharing and inventory efficiency's relationship in the
   manufacturing sector. Moreover, demand information sharing affected the
   dynamic supply chain.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {42-52},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Optimization of supply chain integration (SCI) is a key issue for
   traditional service firms which are seeking transition towards service
   mass customization (SMC). However, conventional research disregards the
   characteristics of SMC and the dynamic nature of SCI optimization
   triggered by the service firm's renewals of its strategy and operational
   decisions in the transition process. To address this challenge
   effectively, this study firstly proposes a resource evaluation method
   from a dynamic and integration process-oriented perspective. It then
   elaborates the impacts of service firm's strategic renewals, as well as
   the operational decisions, namely the resource scheduling decisions, on
   the evolution of the resource's integration value. On this basis, it
   illustrates the mechanism of the dynamic SCI optimization in SMC, and
   further designs a novel SCI optimization model along with a
   corresponding genetic algorithm. In particular, tradeoff between
   customized demands and scale effects, which is the paradox of SMC, is
   regarded as an essential optimization objective besides SCI performance.
   The feasibility and validity of the model and algorithm are verified by
   applying them to a numerical example. By incorporating the perspective
   of service operations, strategic change and the methodology of
   operations research, this study contributes to the literature of SCI in
   SMC by developing a dynamic resource evaluation method and a novel
   optimization model.},

Abstract = {Motivated by the recovery of modular-structured products, this study
   addresses the flexible design of a reverse supply chain (RSC) over a
   planning horizon while incorporating the dynamic uncertain behavior of
   product returns. The stochastic parameter is modeled as a scenario tree
   and therefore the concerned problem is formulated as a multistage
   mixed-integer stochastic program. To alleviate the computational
   complexity of the proposed model, it is decomposed into smaller scenario
   cluster submodels associated with a number of subtrees that share a
   certain number of predecessor nodes in the original scenario tree. The
   submodels are coordinated into an implementable solution via a
   Lagrangian-progressive hedging-based method that employs a viable
   Benders decomposition based algorithm for solving each scenario cluster
   submodel. Based on a realistic scale case, computational results
   indicate the superiority of the proposed flexible dynamic RSC design
   model compared to the existing models. Results also demonstrate the
   efficiency of the proposed solution approach.},

Title = {The shock of lockdown on the spending on wine in the Iberian market: the
   effects of procurement and consumption patterns},
Journal = {BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {124},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1622-1640},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to provide a better understanding of the
   behaviour of wine consumers in a completely new and unexpected setting,
   that is, a forced lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It seeks to
   explain consumer decisions and the probability of changes occurring in
   wine expenditure compared to a normal situation.
   Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis, conducted on a
   representative sample of Iberian consumers and based on the random
   utility theory, consists in the application of a multinomial logit
   model, setting the ``usual{''} pattern of expenditure as a baseline
   category. Findings The results show that the coronavirus pandemic could
   have changed alcohol drinking habits. Consumers generally spent less on
   wine during the lockdown, maybe due to the uncertainty regarding their
   future income and professional situation. Those people more likely to
   spend more on wine were those who increased their wine consumption
   during the lockdown, those who drank for romantic purposes, those who
   purchased less wine in supermarkets but more online, those who used a
   wine app and those living in urban areas. The increased consumption of
   other alcoholic beverages also increases the probability of spending
   less than usual on wine. Additionally, the absence of certain reasons
   for drinking wine other than social purposes, such as wine and food
   pairing, its taste and relaxing effects, together with the previous
   consumption pattern leads to a decrease in the probability of spending
   less per bottle. Originality/value This paper makes a significant
   contribution to the understanding of the determinants of wine
   consumption in a very abnormal setting, an imposed lockdown and provides
   important policy implications. The findings show that managers and
   policymakers should pay attention to the different influence of
   variables related to behaviour and consumption patterns that may
   contribute to an increase in the demand for less expensive wines.
   Specifically, they should focus on new consumption patterns that may
   arise, adapting the supply chain and defining appropriate marketing
   strategies to fill new market segments.},

   Riveting of Clutch Disc Spacer Bolts: Experimental and Computational

Abstract = {The rapid growth of the emerging markets has pushed the automotive
   original equipment manufacturers to relocalize production to reduce
   manufacturing and logistic costs. To ensure an efficient and flexible
   supply chain, local suppliers are appointed. However, the
   characteristics of materials available in each region may have minor
   differences, and when geometry and process design recommendations that
   were developed for certain materials are implemented for materials under
   a different regional standard, different results are obtained. Such is
   the case of the clutch disc spacer bolt, in which its compression during
   riveting has a direct effect in the noise and vibration isolation of the
   vehicle. It has been reported that spacer bolts produced with materials
   considered to be equivalent in Europe and North America (DIN C10C and
   SAE-AISI 1010 steels) behave different during riveting, even though they
   have very similar chemical compositions and are delivered with a similar
   UTS and ductility. The aim of this paper is to compare the compression
   behavior of both materials during riveting, and to explain the factors
   affecting the material response during compression that lead to
   differences in the final geometry. Finite element simulations are used
   for the analysis and validated experimentally by a controlled prototype
   production. Results indicated that 1010 steel compresses in average 0.3
   mm more than C10C steel, caused by the yield stress difference.
   Experimental results were within the simulation results range.
   Microstructural analysis and microhardness measurements are reported in
   order to explain the deformation mechanisms. Finally, a change in the
   spacer bolt barrel dimension prior riveting is proposed based on finite
   element simulations to overcome their differences and produce a rivet
   under specification.},

Title = {Understanding the role of logistics capabilities in achieving supply
   chain agility: a systematic literature review},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {438-453},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of logistics
   capabilities in achieving supply chain agility through a
   multi-disciplinary review of the relevant research. The systematic
   literature review aims to provide the basis for formulating a conceptual
   framework of the relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach - A systematic, comprehensive review of the
   literature on manufacturing, organizational and supply chain agility
   from 1991 through 2010 was conducted. The literature on logistics
   capabilities was also examined to identify the various elements that
   contribute to supply chain agility.
   Findings - Supply chain agility has primarily been explored in the
   literature through a focus on manufacturing flexibility, supply chain
   speed, or lean manufacturing. The role of logistics capabilities in
   achieving supply chain agility has not been addressed from a holistic
   conceptual perspective. This research addresses that gap using a
   multi-disciplinary approach. As such, it is the first phase in theory
   building on the concept of supply chain agility. Further research is
   needed to empirically test the conceptualized relationships.
   Research limitations/implications - This research is a systematic,
   integrative review of the existing literature on the concept of agility
   and logistics capabilities. As such, the next phase of research needed
   for theory building will be the operationalization of constructs and
   testing of the hypothesized relationships proposed by the conceptual
   framework.
   Practical implications - The level of agility in a supply chain can
   determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the collective efforts. It
   is important that firms become more knowledgeable about the role of
   logistics capabilities in achieving agility.
   Originality/value - Through a systematic, comprehensive review of the
   literature in four distinct areas, the paper explores the relationship
   between logistics capabilities and supply chain agility.},

Abstract = {Due to short product life cycle, it is expedient to reconfiguration an

   determine adaptive decisions of operational units of a mobile phone
   supply chain. Agent-based simulation output is subjected to data mining
   analysis to understand system behaviour in terms of interactions and the

Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1101-1123},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Purpose Utilizing a top-down approach of middle-range theorizing (MRT),
   the purpose of this paper is to integrate relational exchange with
   institutional theory to examine how companies manage supply chain
   relationships to achieve desired supply chain outcomes in industries
   characterized by varying degrees of regulatory mandates that restrict
   the choice of supply chain partners. The authors identify this supply
   chain relationship dynamic as constrained choice.
   Design/methodology/approach A moderated mediation model is tested using
   survey data from producers in the US wine industry to investigate the
   effects of regulatory pressure on the ability of wine producers to
   achieve operational coordination when responding to relational behaviors
   through either trust or calculative commitment. Findings Results find
   that relational behaviors can improve operational coordination through
   two distinct paths: trust or calculative commitment. With the moderating
   effect of regulatory pressure, relational behaviors more effectively
   facilitate operational coordination through trust. Alternately,
   regulatory pressure attenuates the mediated relationship through
   calculative commitment. Research limitations/implications - The research
   introduces constrained choice dynamics into the supply chain
   relationship literature via MRT. Integrating generative mechanisms from
   relational exchange and institutional theories provides theoretical
   depth and context-specific knowledge about relationships that operate in
   constrained choice situations. Practical implications - Managers
   impacted by constrained choice should recognize that mechanisms
   typically resulting in positive relationship outcomes may respond
   differently in the presence of regulatory constraints. With greater
   regulatory pressure, efforts to enhance operational coordination are
   more effective using relational mechanisms to build trust. When trust is
   diminished, calculative commitment can be effective in achieving
   operational coordination, although extensive regulations make it more
   difficult. Originality/value Previous research traditionally assumes
   that managers are free to select suitable trading partners that ensure
   mutually beneficial relationships. The research develops a middle-range
   theory examining the constrained choice dynamic in relationships that
   are impacted to varying degrees by regulatory institutions.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to analyse the potential effects on bilateral trade
   movements of the reconfiguration of maritime networks brought about by
   the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The gravity model of international
   trade is applied to examine the hypothesized impact of maritime network
   reconfiguration on the bilateral trade between nine exporting countries
   (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica, Singapore,
   Malaysia and Indonesia) and their 128 trading partners. The panel data
   on the five components of the Liner Shipping Bilateral Connectivity
   Index, the export value, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the nine
   exporting countries, the GDP of their trading partners and the maritime
   distance linking them to these 128 trading partners for each of the
   years from 2008 to 2016 are used in the analysis. The results show that
   the estimated coefficient for the number of transhipments is negative,
   revealing an inverse relationship between transhipments and bilateral
   exports, reconfirming that a redesign of the maritime supply chain
   network in response to the BRI could significantly improve bilateral
   export values. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of required
   transhipments, because of a reconfiguration of maritime networks with
   BRI trading partners, will improve the maritime network structure
   between countries located along the three strategic chokepoints: the
   Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, and the Strait of Malacca. In general
   terms, the BRI-driven reconfiguration of maritime supply networks is
   linked to an improvement in the productivity of nine exporting
   countries. An innovative gravity-based econometric model, estimated on a
   large set of panel data, is introduced below, aiming at the modelling of
   the effect of BRI on supply chain network reconfiguration.},

Title = {An enhanced PSO algorithm to configure a responsive-resilient supply
   chain network considering environmental issues: a case study of the
   oxygen concentrator device},
Journal = {NEURAL COMPUTING \& APPLICATIONS},
Abstract = {In recent years, the hyper-competitive marketplace has led to a drastic
   enhancement in the importance of the supply chain problem. Hence, the
   attention of managers and researchers has been attracted to one of the
   most crucial problems in the supply chain management area called the
   supply chain network design problem. In this regard, this research
   attempts to design an integrated forward and backward logistics network
   by proposing a multi-objective mathematical model. The suggested model
   aims at minimizing the environmental impacts and the costs while
   maximizing the resilience and responsiveness of the supply chain. Since
   uncertainty is a major issue in the supply chain problem, the present
   paper studies the research problem under the mixed uncertainty and
   utilizes the robust possibilistic stochastic method to cope with the
   uncertainty. On the other side, since configuring a supply chain is
   known as an NP-Hard problem, this research develops an enhanced particle
   swarm optimization algorithm to obtain optimal/near-optimal solutions in
   a reasonable time. Based on the achieved results, the developed
   algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions (i.e. solutions with zero or
   a very small gap from the optimal solution) in a reasonable amount of
   time. The achieved results demonstrate the negative impact of the
   enhancement of the demand on environmental damages and the total cost.
   Also, according to the outputs, by increasing the service level, the
   total cost and environmental impacts have increased by 41\% and 10\%,
   respectively. On the other hand, the results show that increasing the
   disrupted capacity parameters has led to a 17\% increase in the total
   costs and a 7\% increase in carbon emissions.},

Title = {Dynamic Game and Coordination Strategy of Multichannel Supply Chain
   Based on Brand Competition},
Journal = {COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {In this paper, two noncooperative dynamic pricing strategies are used in
   a supply chain. Two dynamic Stackelberg game models have been built
   involving both a manufacturer and a retailer assumed to be the leader in
   order. In the two models, the manufacturer sells national-brand (NB)
   product to an independent retailer or directly to consumers through a
   direct channel. The retailers sell a store-brand (SB) product when they
   sell the NB product coming from the manufacturer. Thus, there is
   competition both in different channels and in products with different
   brands. To analyze the complexity of the model, parameter bifurcation
   diagrams and strange attractor diagrams have been therefore plotted. The
   results show that the game leader has advantages when the market is
   stable, but it turns disadvantageous if the state falls into unstable as
   the game follower can quickly adjust the strategy to seize the market.
   The wholesale price and the direct selling price are high that they
   incur larger profits if the manufacturer is dominant, but it gets worse
   when the adjustment speed increases. While in the model where the
   retailer plays a dominant role, the increase in the adjustment speed is
   unfavorable to retailer. By controlling the total cost of the direct
   channel and increasing channel competition strength and brand
   competition strength, the manufacturers can increase their profits in
   the game dominated by the retailer. In addition, the stable region
   within the system will be narrow since the market is sensitive to the
   channel competition, brand competition, and advertising indifference.},

Title = {Compensating for Dynamic Supply Disruptions: Backup Flexibility Design},
Journal = {OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {390-405},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {To increase resilience in supply chains, we investigate the optimal
   design of flexibility in a backup system. We model the dynamics of
   disruptions as Markov chains, and consider a multiproduct, multisupplier
   supply chain under dynamic disruption risks. Using our model, we first
   show that a little flexibility in the backup system can go a long way in
   mitigating dynamic disruption risks. This raises an important and
   fundamental question in designing flexibility in the backup system: to
   achieve the benefits of full backup flexibility, which unreliable
   suppliers should be backed up? To answer this question, we connect the
   supply chain to various queueing and dam models by analyzing the
   dynamics of the inventory shortfall process. Using this connection, we
   show that backing up suppliers merely based on first moment
   considerations such as their average reliability or average product
   demand can be misleading. All else equal, it is better to back up
   suppliers with (1) longer but less frequent disruptions, and (2) lower
   demand uncertainty. In addition to such second moment effects, by
   employing the Renyi's Theorem, we demonstrate that when disruptions are
   relatively long (if they occur), backing up the suppliers for which the
   expected wasted backup capacity is minimum provides the best backup
   flexibility design. We also develop easy-to-compute and yet effective
   indices that (a) guide the supply chain designer in deciding which
   suppliers to backup, and (b) provide insights into the role of various
   factors such as inventory holding and shortage costs, purchasing costs,
   suppliers reliabilities, and product demand distributions in designing
   backup flexibility.},

Title = {MITIGATE: a dynamic supply chain cyber risk assessment methodology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION SECURITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {1-35},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Modern port infrastructures have become highly dependent on the
   operation of complex, dynamic ICT-based maritime supply chains. This
   makes them open and vulnerable to the rapidly changing ICT threat
   landscape and many ports are not yet fully prepared for that.
   Furthermore, these supply chains represent a highly interrelated cyber
   ecosystem, in which a plethora of distributed ICT systems of various
   business partners interact with each other. Due to these interrelations,
   isolated threats and vulnerabilities within a system of a single
   business partner may propagate and have cascading effects on multiple
   other systems, thus resulting in a large-scale impact on the whole
   supply chain. In this context, this article proposes a novel
   evidence-driven risk assessment methodology, i.e., the MITIGATE
   methodology, to analyze the risk level of the whole maritime supply
   chain. This methodology builds upon publicly available information,
   well-defined mathematical approaches and best practices to automatically
   identify and assess vulnerabilities and potential threats of the
   involved cyber assets. As a major benefit, the methodology provides a
   constantly updated risk evaluation not only of all cyber assets within
   each business partner in the supply chain but also of the cyber
   interconnections among those business partners. Additionally, the whole
   process is based on qualitative risk scales, which makes the assessment
   as well as the results more intuitive. The main goal of the MITIGATE
   methodology is to support the port authorities as well as the risk
   officers of all involved business partners.},

Title = {Dynamic Authentication for Cross-Realm SOA-Based Business Processes},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SERVICES COMPUTING},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-32},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Modern distributed applications are embedding an increasing degree of
   dynamism, from dynamic supply-chain management, enterprise federations,
   and virtual collaborations to dynamic resource acquisitions and service
   interactions across organizations. Such dynamism leads to new challenges
   in security and dependability. Collaborating services in a system with a
   Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) may belong to different security
   realms but often need to be engaged dynamically at runtime. If their
   security realms do not have a direct cross-realm authentication
   relationship, it is technically difficult to enable any secure
   collaboration between the services. A potential solution to this would
   be to locate intermediate realms at runtime, which serve as an
   authentication path between the two separate realms. However, the
   process of generating an authentication path for two distributed
   services can be highly complicated. It could involve a large number of
   extra operations for credential conversion and require a long chain of
   invocations to intermediate services. In this paper, we address this
   problem by designing and implementing a new cross-realm authentication
   protocol for dynamic service interactions, based on the notion of
   service-oriented multiparty business sessions. Our protocol requires
   neither credential conversion nor establishment of any authentication
   path between the participating services in a business session. The
   correctness of the protocol is formally analyzed and proven, and an
   empirical study is performed using two production-quality Grid systems,
   Globus 4 and CROWN. The experimental results indicate that the proposed
   protocol and its implementation have a sound level of scalability and
   impose only a limited degree of performance overhead, which is for
   example comparable with those security-related overheads in Globus 4.},

Title = {Adaptive Supply Chain: Demand-Supply Synchronization Using Deep
   Reinforcement Learning},
Journal = {ALGORITHMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Adaptive and highly synchronized supply chains can avoid a cascading
   rise-and-fall inventory dynamic and mitigate ripple effects caused by
   operational failures. This paper aims to demonstrate how a deep
   reinforcement learning agent based on the proximal policy optimization
   algorithm can synchronize inbound and outbound flows and support
   business continuity operating in the stochastic and nonstationary
   environment if end-to-end visibility is provided. The deep reinforcement
   learning agent is built upon the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm,
   which does not require hardcoded action space and exhaustive
   hyperparameter tuning. These features, complimented with a
   straightforward supply chain environment, give rise to a general and
   task unspecific approach to adaptive control in multi-echelon supply
   chains. The proposed approach is compared with the base-stock policy, a
   well-known method in classic operations research and inventory control
   theory. The base-stock policy is prevalent in continuous-review
   inventory systems. The paper concludes with the statement that the
   proposed solution can perform adaptive control in complex supply chains.
   The paper also postulates fully fledged supply chain digital twins as a
   necessary infrastructural condition for scalable real-world
   applications.},

Abstract = {Pakistani service sector is growing rapidly, however there is a scarcity
   of empirical investigation related to supply chain issues in wireless
   internet services in Pakistan. This Study provides a strategic
   perspective for devising the supply chain strategies (SCS), in
   coordination to the competitive strategies (CS), targeting the desired
   performance objectives. The strategic fit/alignment between CS and SCS
   in Pakistani wireless internet industry was explored and the influence
   of these alignments on the performance was investigated. An adapted
   survey questionnaire was used and 77 respondents from 8 companies in
   Pakistan participated in the survey. General Linear Regression Model
   (GLM) was used to extract and interpret results. Major findings show
   high correlations between competitive and supply chain strategies
   alignments. It is also found that choice of combination between CS and
   SCS affects business and supply chain performance. Implementation of
   supply chain management (SCM) practices in Pakistani wireless industry
   are mainly stalled by ``Traditional Practices{''} (mostly ranked top),
   ``Leadership{''}, (drops the organizational performance) and ``Time
   Constraint{''}, ``Low Budget \& Expenditure{''}, and ``Resources{''}
   (boost the organizational performance). A convenient sampling technique
   is used to collect the information through the adapted questionnaire.
   Supply chain managers can opt the best combination of CS and SCS
   dimensions in the presence of hurdles; he/she is facing before
   implementation of new business strategy to improve the organizational
   performance. Identification of the best alignment of CS and SCS
   dimensions is expected to lead the organization towards a productive

Title = {A fuzzy multi attribute decision framework with integration of QFD and
   grey relational analysis},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {474-485},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective: This paper proposes a multi attribute decision support model
   in a supply chain in order to solve complex decision problems. The paper
   provides a platform to ease decision process through the integration of
   quality function deployment (QFD) and grey relational analysis (GRA) in
   demonstrating main supply chain drivers under fuzzy environment.
   Methodology: The proposed method is important because of several points:
   First of all, in a supply chain system, evaluation factors are not
   really independent and must be addressed in relation to the external
   factors such as customer requirements. Hence, we have applied QFD tool.
   Second, due to the constant uncertainty in the supply chain environment,
   fuzziness among the factors has to be considered. So, an interval valued
   fuzzy model was implemented. Third, to examine the proposed decision
   system in reality, it was applied in Risk and Uncertain Conditions for
   Agriculture Production Systems (RUC-APS) project.
   Contribution: An integrated version of QFD and GRA is presented. It is
   assumed that QFD can act to measure optimal solutions based on the
   distance to ideal solutions. In an interval-valued fuzzy environment the
   enormous volume of computation by Euclidean distance doesn't allow
   decision makers to obtain the results easily. This drawback is addressed
   using gray relational analysis. The gray relational coefficient is
   integrated to the fuzzy QFD to measure the distance of potential
   solutions from ideal solutions. This integration facilitates decision
   making process in further problems once big data are available
   Results: To obtain the importance degrees of logistic indicators in the
   supply chain, expert team considered the environmental, social \&
   cultural, and economic factors as external dimension of the QFD. The
   other dimension of QFD includes supply chain drivers such as quality,
   environmental management system, supply chain flexibility, corporate
   social responsibility, transportation service condition, and financial
   stability. The decision model is solved and the ranking of indicators is
   achieved. A sensitivity analysis helps to test and check the performance
   of the decision model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to provide evidence on the impact
   of network flexibility and its ambidextrous influence on a firm's
   exploratory and exploitative partnership selection.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors develop our hypotheses based on
   the literature of network flexibility and draw on a sample of publicly
   listed firms in Taiwan semiconductor and optoelectronics industries. The
   authors collect our data from survey questionnaires and archival sources
   and examine our hypotheses by using the generalized linear model (GLM)
   approach. Findings The authors' empirical findings show that
   configuration flexibility has a greater influence on exploratory
   partnerships, while manufacturing flexibility has a greater impact on
   exploitative partnerships. In addition, when firms are ambidextrous
   (i.e. have both types of flexibility), they are able to simultaneously
   obtain both exploratory and exploitative partnerships. The authors'
   findings indicate that balancing network flexibility is critical when
   firms execute ambidextrous alliance strategies. Research
   limitations/implications The authors' use of survey data to measure
   network flexibility may limit our observations related to network
   evolution. In addition, the authors' use of public annual reports to
   capture firm partnerships may cause us to ignore informal relationships
   between partners. Practical implications The authors' empirical findings
   suggest that the types of partnerships firms develop depend on which
   types of flexibility they possess. The results further suggest that
   decision makers have to find a way to develop a balanced strategy
   between network configuration and manufacturing flexibility when they
   would like to develop an ambidextrous alliance strategy.
   Originality/value The authors' study advances the understanding in the
   literature on supply chain flexibility and its ambidexterity by
   connecting network flexibility and ambidextrous alliance strategy. The
   authors offer a guide to supply chain managers in the area of network

Title = {Dynamic development and execution of closed-loop supply chains: a
   natural resource-based view},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {453-469},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to reflect on recent closed-loop supply chain
   (CLSC) practices using a natural resource-based view (NRBV) and dynamic
   capabilities (DC) perspective.
   Design/methodology/approach - Two empirical case studies of CLSC
   exemplars are used to discuss the theoretical relevance of these views.
   Findings - The paper shows how strategic resources help companies in two
   sectors achieve successful CLSC designs. Strategic supply chain
   collaboration is an important success factor but also presents a number
   of challenges. The NRBV is used to explain the importance of new
   resources in technology, knowledge and relationships and stresses the
   role of DCs to constantly address changes in the business environment to
   renew these strategic resources.
   Research limitations/implications - This research elaborates on NRBV
   theory related to CLSCs and reinforces the inclusion of DCs. It
   specifies the application of NRBV in the context of textiles and carpet
   manufacture and highlights the inherent conflicts in seeking value while
   moving towards sustainable development.
   Practical implications - Investments in technical and operational
   resources are required to create CLSCs. Pure closed-loop applications
   are impractical, requiring relationships with multiple external partners
   to obtain supply and demand for recycled products.
   Social implications - CLSCs may provide opportunities for social
   enterprises or third sector organizations collaborating with
   manufacturers.
   Originality/value - This paper provides insights into the constituent
   resources needed for successful CLSCs. It also helps move CLSC research
   from a tactical logistics problem to a problem of strategic resources
   and relational capabilities: what we term ``dynamic supply chain
   execution{''}. This paper develops a framework for transitioning towards
   CLSCs, underlining the importance of co-development and forging new
   relationships through commitment to supply chain redesign, co-evolution
   with customers and suppliers and control of supply chain activities.},

Title = {Supply chain resilience in the UK during the coronavirus pandemic: A
   resource orchestration perspective},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {245},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to global
   operations and supply chains. While the huge impact of the pandemic has
   nurtured important literature over the last couple of years, little is
   being said about the role of resource orchestration in supporting
   resilience in highly disruptive contexts. Thus, this study aims to this
   knowledge gap by proposing an original model to explore supply chain
   resilience (SCRE) antecedents, considering supply chain alertness (SCAL)
   as a central point to support resilience. This study focuses on the
   resource orchestration theory (ROT) to design a conceptual model. The
   partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) served to
   validate the model, exploring data from the UK supply chain
   decision-makers. The study reveals a number of both expected and
   unexpected findings. These include the evidence that supply chain
   disruption orientation (SCDO) has a strong positive effect on the SCAL.
   In addition, SCAL plays a strong positive effect in resource
   reconfiguration (RREC), supply chain efficiency (SCEF) and SCRE. We
   further identified a partial mediation effect of RREC on the
   relationship between SCAL and SCRE. Surprisingly, it appeared that SCAL
   strongly influences SCEF, while SCEF itself does not create any
   significant effect on SCRE. For managers and practitioners, the
   importance of resource orchestration as a decisive approach to
   adequately respond to huge disruptions is clearly highlighted by our
   results. Finally, this paper helps to grasp better how important
   resource orchestration in operations and supply chains remains for
   appropriate responses to high disruptions such as the COVID-19 impacts.},

Title = {Resilience effects in food consumption behaviour at the time of
   Covid-19: perspectives from Italy},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic lead Italy to undertake a severe lockdown for
   almost two months. All of a sudden, the lives of Italians were forced to
   shift in accordance with the regulations issued by government. This
   change in the lives of Italians can be mirrored by an adjustment in food
   consumer behaviour that, consequently, brought about a transition in the
   whole supply chain. This paper gives an overview of the recent changes
   in consumption patterns that occurred due to the Italian lockdown, and
   how evolutions in behaviour are intertwined with the evolution of the
   main food supply chains. Many of the events here depicted are likely to
   last far beyond the crisis and affect the subsequent evolution of food
   consumption in Italy. The Italian retail supply chain successfully
   adapted to the big shift in consumption. Despite purchases for essential
   items having increased, no stockout harmed the food security of
   Italians. Out-of-home consumption moved inside houses giving space to
   home meal preparation and comfort food. Home delivery has been the most
   important element in this context, as it boomed during this period,
   helping laggard consumers fill the digital divide, as it was mostly
   mediated by e-commerce platforms and instant messaging. It was also the
   leverage that allowed small retailers and small producers regain their
   space. This crisis calls for a more sustainable food system that will be
   increasingly oriented to moving goods rather than people, which will
   also have relevance in the coming years.},

   Technology and Bilateral Platforms},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {E-commerce platform enterprises have typical bilateral market
   characteristics. The e-commerce platform provides real-time
   communication services for buyers and sellers. Different buyers and
   sellers form crossnetwork characteristics. The formulation and
   implementation of bilateral strategies affect both the merchants and
   consumers' choice of platform and registration transactions. This impact
   will directly lead to the transaction value of the platform. Then, the
   article builds an econometric model and empirically analyses the impact
   of e-commerce platforms. The e-commerce chain is a complex structure
   that consists of logistics, information flow, and capital flow and
   connects suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and users in the
   industry together. Blockchain technology can be used as a large-scale
   collaboration tool to adapt to supply chain management, the main factor
   that drives the market power of the enterprise. The research results
   show that the input costs of advertising, research and development, and
   employee training and the impact of long-term investment and taxation on
   market forces are quite different in different industries, both positive
   and negative, and subsidies, inventory, and state-owned holdings have a
   negative impact on the market power of companies in all industries.
   Finally, the competition strategy of e-commerce platform enterprises is
   summarized. On the basis of the conclusions of the theory and case
   study, the paper puts forward specific suggestions and countermeasures
   for the competition strategy of e-commerce platform enterprises in the
   bilateral network environment.},

Title = {How can cross-functional integration support the development of
   resilience capabilities? The case of collaboration in the automotive
   industry},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {789-801},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to analyze cross-functional integration
   processes and their respective impacts on resilience capabilities, with
   particular emphasis on collaboration, in an automotive supply chain.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A case study was conducted in an automotive supply chain through 18
   in-depth interviews with managers from six different companies, namely,
   two suppliers, one focal manufacturer and three customers. The
   automotive industry is one of the most vital industries in the Brazilian
   economy and is still recovering from the 2015 financial crisis, making
   it an interesting case for this research.
   Findings
   The findings reveal several links between resilience and
   cross-functional integration literatures through the analysis of three
   basic categories, namely, disruptions (lack of product, interruption of
   production, delivery delay, organizational bankruptcy and sales loss);
   capabilities (redundancy, flexibility, adaptability, collaboration,
   visibility and agility); and integration factors (cross-functional
   meetings, adequate communication, longevity of relationships,
   cross-functional training, recognition of interdependence and the
   consideration given to informal groups).
   Practical implications
   This research addresses several implications for practitioners. Managers
   should pay attention to the cross-functional teams, which may provide
   internal collaboration, and hence collaboration in the supply chain.
   Originality/value
   This paper suggests a new concept for the collaboration capability.
   According to the results, collaboration is the capability of dealing
   with formal and informal factors to integrate both the internal
   functions and supply chain members, which can provide visibility,
   agility and adaptability toward supply chain resilience.},

Title = {Identifying industry 5.0 contributions to sustainable development: A
   strategy roadmap for delivering sustainability values},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {716-737},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Scholars believe that the newly introduced Industry 5.0 has the
   potential to move beyond the profit-centered productivity of Industry
   4.0 and to promote sustainable development goals such as
   human-centricity, socio-environmental sustainability, and resilience.
   However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined
   phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these
   speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study
   developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which
   Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions.
   The study first developed and introduced the Indus-try 5.0 reference
   model that describes the technical and functional properties of this
   phenomenon. The study fur-ther conducted a content-centric synthesis of
   the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of
   Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique
   was employed to identify the sequen-tial relationships among the
   functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable
   development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0
   experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry
   5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions.
   Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance,
   intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable
   integra-tion, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the
   functions identified. These functions are highly interre-lated and
   should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and
   complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development
   value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability
   de-veloped in this study is expected to provide a better understanding
   of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustain-able development,
   explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to
   maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability
   values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research,
   emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as
   Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0.(c) 2022 Published by

Journal = {DYNAMIC GAMES AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {112-130},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We consider a supply chain in which a manufacturer stimulates his
   retailers investing more local advertising expenditures through a
   cooperative advertising program (Co-op). Co-op advertising programs
   usually involve two important contractual terms, a participation rate
   and an accrual rate. While previous literatures have discussed the
   participation rate excessively, they seldom study the role of the
   accrual rate in cooperative advertising. To investigate the impact of
   the accrual rate on cooperative advertising decisions, we develop a
   dynamic cooperative advertising model for a single manufacturer-single
   retailer supply chain that incorporates the participation rate and the
   accrual rate simultaneously. We derive the equilibrium co-op decisions
   of two channel members, including the manufacturer's national
   advertising efforts and his participation rate, as well as the
   retailer's local advertising expenditure. Our analysis of the
   equilibrium solutions shows that an increase in participation rate will
   not always increase the retailer's advertising efforts because of the
   accrual rate. Also, both the manufacturer and retailer can benefit from
   a high accrual rate.},

Abstract = {Currently, the supply chain management model has been widely adopted
   worldwide. Internationally renowned companies such as IBM and Walmart
   have made significant achievements in supply chain management and have
   played a greater role in promoting the growth of their interests.
   However, while they are enjoying their own interests, they are also
   facing various risks in the supply chain. From the perspective of
   systems engineering, this paper uses complex network theory as a
   research tool to study supply chain networks and systematically study
   the important issues of supply chain network risks. This paper analyzes
   the new characteristics of the relationship between enterprises and
   suppliers in the supply chain and which indicators should be selected as
   the basis for evaluating suppliers from the perspective of cooperation
   and development, which more comprehensively reflects the characteristics
   of the new enterprise-supplier relationship in the supply chain
   environment. This highlights the evaluation of the supplier's
   cooperation ability and development ability. Aiming at the problem of
   supply chain network system identification and integrated evaluation, a
   supply chain security evaluation model and index system research
   framework model are proposed, and the intercompany business risk and
   supply chain in supply chain network evaluation are introduced. As a
   model for evaluating transition parameters, the study of supply chain
   risk propagation introduces the theory of dynamic propagation in complex
   networks, the law of evolution, and the supplier's dynamic supply chain
   risk model. The experimental results of this paper show that when the
   global reputation value is 0.5 and the local reputation value is 0.8 and
   0.7, the trust degree changes with the change of the confidence factor;
   when the value of the confidence factor decreases, the degree of trust
   converges more and more to the global reputation and vice versa. It can
   be seen that this model has high feasibility.},

Abstract = {Purpose Firms can choose from an array of approaches for reducing the
   detrimental financial effects caused by unfavorable fluctuations in
   commodity prices. The purpose of this paper is to provide guidance for
   effectively estimating the financial effects of mitigating commodity
   price risk volatility (CPV) in supply chain management decisions.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts two prominent and
   complementary methodologies, namely, total cost of ownership (TCO and
   real options valuation (ROV), to illustrate how commodity price risk
   mitigation strategies can be analyzed with respect to their effect on
   costs and performance. The paper provides insights through a case study
   to demonstrate the application of these methods together and establish
   the benefits and challenges associated with their implementation.
   Findings The paper illustrates advantages and disadvantages of TCO and
   ROV and how these approaches can be adopted together to contribute to
   effective purchasing decisions. Supply chain flexibility is a key
   capability but requires investments. Holistically measuring the
   financial effects of flexibility investments is imperative for gaining
   executive management support in mitigating commodity price volatility.
   Research limitations/implications This study can provide supply chain
   professionals with useful guidance for measuring the costs and benefits
   related to developing strategies for mitigating commodity price
   volatility. TCO provides a focus on the costs associated with the
   commodity purchasing process, and ROV enables the aggregation of all the
   costs and benefits associated with the use of the strategy and
   synthesizes them into the net value estimate. Originality/value The
   paper provides a comparison of different but complementary approaches,
   specifically TCO and ROV, for analyzing the effectiveness of CPV risk
   mitigation decisions. In addition, these two methods allow supply chain

Title = {Evaluation of Humanitarian Supply Chain Resilience in Flood Disaster},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Frequent natural hazards such as flooding and the devastating
   consequences of severe events make the humanitarian supply chain
   particularly important in alleviating the suffering of those communities
   impacted by such events. However, the ambiguity of information and the
   different goals of stakeholders demand that the humanitarian supply
   chain must be resilient. This research adopts the use of literature
   review and expert opinions to identify the indicators that affect the
   resilience of the humanitarian supply chain using the flood event in
   Hechuan District, China in 2020 as an example. Based on the combination
   of fuzzy Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and Analytic
   Network Process (fuzzy-DEMATEL-ANP), the interrelationships between the
   indicators and the weights of each indicator are calculated. The
   research results indicate that decision-makers in the humanitarian
   supply chain should vigorously coordinate the cooperation among
   stakeholders, ensure the effective transmission of information, and
   formulate forward-looking strategic plans. At the same time, these key
   decision makers should also be aware of the need to adjust their
   strategies at different stages of the flooding event in order to achieve
   a flexible humanitarian supply chain that responds to the varying
   demands over the course of a flooding event. The results of this study
   will help professionals involved in humanitarian supply chains to
   develop strategies and plans to become more resilient thus helping to
   reduce losses from natural hazards such as floods.},

Title = {Conquering in emerging markets: critical success factors to enhance
   supply chain performance},
Journal = {BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {570-593},
Abstract = {Purpose- In the context of emerging economies, the purpose of this paper
   is to seek the critical success factors (CSFs) of supply chain and
   identify their relationships to enhance the supply chain performance
   (SCP) in a sample of Indian manufacturing firms.
   Design/methodology/approach-On the basis of a comprehensive literature
   review, the authors conducted this study and proposed a new model of
   antecedent and outcomes for SCP in emerging markets. The empirical data
   for this study were drawn from a survey of 227 Indian firms, resulting
   in a response rate of 52 percent. The method of confirmatory factor
   analysis was applied to refine the CSFs and SCP scale for empirical
   analysis. The data were analyzed by employing the structural equation
   modeling technique.
   Findings- The results reveal that all the identified CSFs, namely,
   agility, flexibility, flexible innovation, information and communication
   technology, collaboration among conglomerate divisions, process
   structure, and training and leadership programs, are positively
   associated with SCP. The empirical study of 227 Indian firms lent good
   support to the hypotheses and validates it by the data analysis.
   Consequently, these findings highlight the prominence of these factors
   of supply chain for gaining a sustainable competitive advantage in
   emerging market scenario.
   Research limitations/implications- The study emphasizes on CSFs in
   emerging markets that will help to boost the organization's SCP through
   agility and flexibility in supply chain. This study is applicable for
   growing markets in which there is ample amount of resources.
   Originality/value- As economic growth stagnates in developed economies,
   emerging markets grow at near double-digit rates. Somehow, this study is
   pioneer in terms of enhance SCP in emerging market scenario. Moreover,
   the outcome of the study could provide empirical evidence of the effects
   of CSFs on SCPs.},

Volume = {59},
Number = {6},
Pages = {470-485},

Abstract = {We consider a generalization of the well-known generalized assignment
   problem (GAP) over discrete time periods encompassed within a finite
   planning horizon. The resulting model, MultiGAP, addresses the
   assignment of tasks to agents within each time period, with the
   attendant single-period assignment costs and agent-capacity constraint
   requirements, in conjunction with transition costs arising between any
   two consecutive periods in which a task is reassigned to a different
   agent. As is the case for its single-period antecedent, MultiGAP offers
   a robust tool for modeling a wide range of capacity planning problems
   occurring within supply chain management. We provide two formulations
   for MultiGAP and establish that the second (alternative) formulation
   provides a tighter bound. We define a Lagrangian relaxation-based
   heuristic as well as a branch-and-bound algorithm for MultiGAP.
   Computational experience with the heuristic and branch-and-bound
   algorithm on over 2500 test problems is reported. The Lagrangian
   heuristic consistently generates high-quality and in many cases
   near-optimal solutions. The branch-and-bound algorithm is also seen to
   constitute an effective means for solving to optimality MultiGAP
   problems of reasonable size. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval

Abstract = {To achieve more efficient recycling management of construction and

   dynamic Nash supply chain model, with and without government subsidy,
   for a C\&D waste recycling treatment system comprised of two recycling

   subsidy regulation on recycling enterprises' technology decisions, the
   optimal proportion of technology upgrades of recycling enterprises, and
   the effects of other exogenous factors on the decision of government and
   recycling enterprises in an early stage of the recycling industry. The
   results show that with the subsidy, the recycling enterprises'
   proportion of technology upgrade and profits is always improved. And
   recycling enterprise will actively increase investment to increase the
   proportion of technology upgrades. Furthermore, the government should
   prioritize assisting enterprises that are among the first to invest in
   recycling technology. Interestingly, the proportion of subsidy and
   technology upgrades is also affected by the unit environmental benefit
   and the degree of substitution of renewable products with different
   technological levels. When the degree of substitution is low, not only
   government subsidies are required to play a role but also builders'
   awareness of the benefits of using high-tech renewable products, in
   order to drive enterprise technology investment from the demand side.
   The study provides detailed information on government and recycling

Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {On-farm timber production is an important subsistence and economic
   activity of smallholder farmers around the world. Farmer investment in
   wood production and the degree of formality in the sector depends on
   access to and conditions of the market, the nature of the regulatory
   frameworks that govern rights to and movement of timber, and access to
   financing. We evaluate the process of formalization of a thriving and
   adaptive existing supply chain for small-dimension lumber originating in
   the fallows of smallholder farmers in the Peruvian Amazon. Through field
   research over three years based in semi-structured interviews with
   diverse actors in the Amazon, we found that the supply chain for fallow
   timber is driven entirely by informal and some illegal transactions. A
   key reason for this is the lack of an appropriate regulatory mechanism
   by which producers can gain authorization to harvest and sell this
   timber. We identify conditions necessary to formalize this sector, and
   evaluate the degree to which these are met under several scenarios. We
   recommend that the state develop mechanisms that recognize property
   rights of long-term residents and establish a simple fallow forestry
   registration mechanism; and that local governments or non-governmental
   organizations adopt adaptive and collaborative approaches to support
   farmers and provide training, information and networking among actors.
   State recognition of and support for fallow forestry, coupled with
   producers organizing for collective action on processing and marketing
   their timber, could result in the formalization of a significant volume
   of timber, improvements in income security for rural people, and the
   development of local entrepreneurial activities.},

Volume = {68},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this article, we address two network design problems for a responsive
   supply chain that consists of make-to-order (make-to-assemble)
   facilities facing stochastic demand and service time. The response time
   to customer orders, critical to the success of the supply chain, is the
   sum of the flow time in the facility and the delivery time to the
   customers. The response time performance in our models is measured by
   the probability that the response time is shorter than a constant. This
   nonlinear performance measure makes the models less or not tractable.
   The objective of both problems is to minimize the expected network cost
   that consists of the cost of delivery to customers as a function of the
   time of delivery (or the mode of transportation), the fixed cost of
   locating facilities and the capacity cost as a linear function of the
   processing capacity. The main decision variables are the number and
   locations of facilities, the resources allocated to them and the
   delivery mode selected between facilities and demand. In the first
   problem, a constraint is imposed to ensure an acceptable response time
   level. In the second problem, a penalty is charged on the number of days
   that each unit is delivered later than the targeted response time and is
   incorporated into the objective function. In the first problem, the
   probabilistic constraint on the flow time can be linearized and the
   problem can be formulated as an integer linear programming model. In the
   second problem, we propose an approximation approach to linearize the
   objective function and an iterative search and cut algorithm to combine
   linear approximation with neighborhood search. A multi-start
   meta-heuristic is also suggested. Computational experiments are
   conducted to evaluate the performance of these solution procedures.
   Recommendations are made on the basis of the computational results. This
   appears to be the first study in the area of locating capacitated
   facilities with stochastic demand to incorporate the delivery mode
   choice decision and to evaluate the expected congestion cost as a
   function of the actual flow time in the facilities, instead of the
   average one. The models developed enable the decision maker to
   investigate the effect of a combination of facility location, capacity
   allocation, and delivery mode decisions on the expected network cost and
   the response time. In addition, the findings of the computational
   experiments shed light on tuning parameters of approximation algorithms.},

Abstract = {Sensing and its electronics based on printed/flexible electronics offer
   unique attributes of mechanical flexibility of its substrate, hence the
   unique applications. Nevertheless, one of the ensuing key challenges of
   flexible-electronics-based sensing is the issues associated with
   consistency and repeatability of its parameters of the flexible
   electronics elements/sensors due to their variations, which are
   sometimes intractable. These may be due to manufacturing variations,
   aging, when the substrate is bent, and so on. In this article, we
   describe our codesign between the different chains of the flexible
   electronics supply chain to derive practically flexible electronics and
   sensors for applications where the substrate is expected to bend, e.g.,
   in an augmented sensing e-skin smart glove application. This effort
   includes our fully additive low-temperature all-air low-cost screen
   printing process, and how we obtain consistency and repeatability. To
   improve the matching of thin-film transistors-a critical consideration
   for conditioning sensor outputs-we describe layout techniques where
   relatively good matching can be achieved, but with area overheads. We
   describe how we accommodate the variations of printed elements and
   circuits embodying printed elements when the substrate is bent-a
   self-compensating means-and propose the application of the same for
   printed sensors. The cost of our self-compensation means is without
   power or area overheads, albeit more (uncomplicated) printing steps. We
   finally describe our process development kit (PDK) encompassing all of
   the aforesaid to predict the performance of the printed circuits and
   sensors, including the effects of bending and our proposed
   self-compensation thereto. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods
   based on measurements on printed elements and circuits.},

   crisis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Respiratory failure complicates most critically ill patients with
   COVID-19 and is characterized by heterogeneous pulmonary parenchymal
   involvement, profound hypoxemia and pulmonary vascular injury. The high
   incidence of COVID-19 related respiratory failure has exposed critical
   shortages in the supply of mechanical ventilators, and providers with
   the necessary skills to treat. Traditional mass-produced ventilators
   rely on an internal compressor and mixer to moderate and control the gas
   mixture delivered to a patient. However, the current emergency has
   energized the pursuit of alternative designs, enabling greater
   flexibility in supply chain, manufacturing, storage, and maintenance
   considerations. To achieve this, we hypothesized that using the medical
   gasses and flow interruption strategy would allow for a high
   performance, low cost, functional ventilator. A low-cost ventilator
   designed and built-in accordance with the Emergency Use guidance from
   the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is presented wherein
   pressurized medical grade gases enter the ventilator and time limited
   flow interruption determines the ventilator rate and tidal volume. This
   simple strategy obviates the need for many components needed in
   traditional ventilators, thereby dramatically shortening the time from
   storage to clinical deployment, increasing reliability, while still
   providing life-saving ventilatory support. The overall design philosophy
   and its applicability in this new crisis is described, followed by both
   bench top and animal testing results used to confirm the precision,
   safety and reliability of this low cost and novel approach to mechanical
   ventilation. The ventilator meets and exceeds the critical requirements
   included in the FDA emergency use guidelines. The ventilator has
   received emergency use authorization from the FDA.},

Title = {Using Human-Centered Design to Adapt Supply Chains and Digital Solutions
   for Community Health Volunteers in Nomadic Communities of Northern Kenya},
Journal = {GLOBAL HEALTH-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Background: Unreliable and nonexistent supply chain procedures and
   processes are one of the primary barriers to achieving functional
   community health units in nomadic communities in the arid/semiarid
   counties of Kenya.
   Methods: We used a human-centered design (HCD) approach to engage
   communities and community health volunteers (CHVs) in redesigning a
   proven data-centric supply chain approach that included a digital
   solution, called cStock, for this challenging context. We conducted the
   HCD process in 4 phases: (1) understanding intent, (2) research and
   insights, (3) ideation and prototyping, and (4) supply chain design and
   requirements building. Data collection used qualitative methods and
   involved a range of
   stakeholders including CHVs, supervisors, and local beneficiaries. CHVs
   and their supervisors also participated in cStock usability testing.
   Drawing on insights and personas generated from the research,
   stakeholders ideated and codesigned supply chain tools. Results: The
   research identified critical insights for informing the redesign of
   cStock for nomadic communities. These insights were categorized into
   supply chain, information systems, human resources, behaviors, service
   delivery infrastructure, and connectivity. Four supply chain data
   solutions were designed, prototyped, tested, and iterated: a stock
   recording paper-based form, a user-friendly cStock application, a
   supervisor cStock application, and an unstructured supplementary service
   data reporting system using feature phones.
   Conclusions: Using the HCD process incorporated the perspective of CHVs
   and their communities and provided key insights to inform the design of
   the supply chain and adapt cStock. The process helped make cStock to be
   inclusive and have the potential to have a meaningful impact on
   strengthening the supply chain for seminomadic and nomadic communities
   in northern Kenya. A strong supply chain for these CHVs will increase
   access to essential and reproductive health commodities and contribute
   to improving the overall health and well-being of these communities,
   especially women and children.},

Journal = {NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},

Pages = {455-477},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In 2017, disruptions in the global supply of helium reminded consumers,
   distributors, and policy makers that the global helium supply chain
   lacks flexibility, and that attempts to increase production from the
   U.S. Federal Helium Reserve (the FHR) may not be able to compensate for
   the loss of one of the few major producers in the world. Issues with
   U.S. and global markets for helium include inelastic demand, economic
   availability of helium only as a byproduct, only 4-5 major producers,
   helium's propensity to escape earth's crust, an ongoing absence of
   storage facilities comparable to the FHR, and a lack of consequences for
   the venting of helium. The complex combination of these economic,
   physical, and regulatory issues is unique to helium, and determining
   helium's practical availability goes far beyond estimating the
   technically accessible volume of underground resources. Although most of
   these issues have been analyzed since helium was recognized to be a
   valuable mineral commodity in the early 1900s, very few economic models
   have been developed that adequately consider the unique characteristics
   of helium and helium markets. In particular, there is a notable lack of
   recent empirical work to estimate the responsiveness of helium demand,
   supply, prices, and trade patterns to the ongoing drawdown and sale of
   helium reserves stored in the FHR. In general, existing models of helium
   either do not account for an oligopoly controlling supply, or they do
   not evaluate potential helium extraction and storage programs based on
   an intertemporal maximization of the value of the resource. Such models
   could be of very limited use to decision makers. This review found only
   one working paper with a helium market model that has incorporated both
   of these vital considerations. That and other economic studies along
   similar lines could be very useful in helping inform current helium
   policy discussions and decisions.},

Abstract = {Purpose The emergence of new digital technologies in the era of the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution presents a turning point that could change
   the fate of the traditional ways of designing, build and manage asset
   data. Disruptive technologies such as Blockchain and theInternet of
   things (IoT) are one of the main pillars that are driving this
   revolution. The integration of decentralised networks and automated
   workflows has the potential to become a pivotal factor in construction
   projects, especially in supply chain ecosystems within the off-site
   manufacturing field. Obstacles related to fragmented information,
   interoperability, transparency and ``big data{''} management are the
   main drivers for change that the industry needs to address. Whilst
   organisations and users can automate workflows and processes by
   utilising IoT technology to transfer data without human-to-human or
   human-to-computer interaction, the interaction, storage and management
   of the data generated are not safe or reliable.
   Design/methodology/approach The approach outlined in this paper
   addresses the challenges that IoT and centralised networks present.
   Blockchain, a peer-to-peer distributed database, offers the possibility
   to support and maintain the asset information without interruptions in
   all the stages of the life cycle. The synergy between these
   technologies, along with other techniques, methods and platforms (such
   as building information modeling (BIM)), based on a single environment,
   will support information traceability from the strategic definition to
   end of life. Findings The framework of this study presents an excellent
   opportunity to apply new workflows and processes with the application of
   new technologies and protocols. It benefits from a well-established
   platform such as BIM to enable the coordination and management of
   digital assets as well as giving illustration and collaboration to the
   supply chain members. IoT and Blockchain are the other layers that work
   together with the third layer (BIM). This framework proposed the use of
   these platforms to ensure the information traceability of physical and
   digital assets, data automation and information management, in a dynamic
   supply chain ecosystem, bringing efficiency and transparency to
   stakeholders and users. Practical implications This study provides an
   exploratory framework to be used by the supply chain members in offsite
   manufacturing, and the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC)
   industry in general, to track asset information throughout their entire
   life cycle securely and transparently. Originality/value This paper
   contributes to the knowledge of IoT, Blockchain technology and BIM use
   in offsite manufacturing under the AEC industry. It provides a basis for
   future research by professionals, experts and academics regarding these
   technologies and their workflows.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a dynamic game modeling several interfaces between
   marketing and operations under vertical coordination and horizontal
   supply chain (SC) competition. An SC has a one-manufacturer-one-retailer
   structure and competes against a symmetric SC. In each SC, the
   manufacturer decides both the production volume and the advertising
   efforts, while the retailer controls both the purchasing volume and the
   selling price. Firms within each SC can manage their business by
   adopting either a wholesale price contract (WPC) or a revenue-sharing
   contract (RSC). In general, an SC can achieve coordination when shifting
   from a WPC to an RSC. Nevertheless, this is no longer true when SC
   competition exists. We show that an RSC is beneficial only when the
   rival SC uses a WPC. In fact, when both SCs adopt an RSC, the general
   advantages gained through coordination vanish and both SCs are
   operationally and economically worse off.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {122},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper presents how to objectively set up the process for activation
   of the future action plans from a supply chain Balanced Scorecard (BSC),
   aligning such an activation process to reach the main objectives and
   being able to save resources. Additionally, it also shows how to define
   supply chain business scenarios based on the future expected values of
   the Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Once the future business scenario
   has been chosen, the KPI values associated with this scenario will
   become the new KPI values of the BSC in order to align efforts and save
   resources Further, the strategic objectives associated with the KPIs may
   also be extensively retuned, thus redefining their target values. From
   the application carried out, there were four KPIs whose values needed,
   in absolute terms, to be increased and four other KPIs to be decreased.
   Additionally, the associated strategic objectives were retuned; for
   example, the value of the strategic objective ``To reduce product
   development costs{''} was initially set in the BSC at 10 \% but it was
   deduced to 8\% as a consequence of the application of the proposal. As a
   result, this methodology has aligned all the future efforts of a whole
   supply chain in order to reach one point on a plane, which is a
   combination of interrelated supply chain KPI. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Extant studies identify different strategic approaches for businesses to
   integrate environment management (EM) into corporate supply chain
   management (SCM) to create different competitive market advantages. With
   increasing market uncertainties, stakeholder complexities, constraints
   of resources, companies nowadays are required to develop more
   context-specific solutions for mitigating sustainability risk and
   improving market performance in supply chain sustainability practices.
   To address the challenges faced by businesses, this study aims to
   explore how a company adapts green supply chain strategies for a
   competitive transformation. Specifically, we aim to identify different
   green supply chain capabilities that form hybrid choices of green
   solutions for a company to leverage an adaptive green shift. Through an
   extensive literature review, this study proposes a conceptual framework
   for exploration which is based on a qualitative in-depth case study in
   the electronics industry-one of the most polluting manufacturing sectors
   in China. The findings show that supply chain characteristics play a
   significant role in the selection of different green SCM solutions by
   businesses. We find different hybrid choices of strategic decisions are
   being made by the case company operating with high-volume and high-value
   supply chains respectively. High-volume supply chains adopt both
   operational pollution and waste control strategies and incremental green
   product strategies to balance cost of operational change and develop a
   competitive eco-efficient market expansion. In contrast, high-value
   supply chains adopt radical green product innovation strategies and
   operational waste prevention strategies to balance cost of product
   innovation and build operational efficiency to expand in a competitive
   eco-differentiation market. A mix of dynamic capabilities involved in
   different supply chain green transformations are also identified.},

Title = {Agri-food 4.0: A survey of the supply chains and technologies for the
   future agriculture},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The term ``Agri-Food 4.0{''} is an analogy to the term Industry 4.0;
   coming from the concept ``agriculture 4.0{''}. Since the origins of the
   industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of
   Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to
   Industry 2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the
   industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence,
   Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest
   developments based on digital technologies as well as the
   interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to
   transmit real-time information in terms behaviour and performance.
   Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex networked
   structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such
   technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply chain
   stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture
   domain is not an exception although it possesses some specialities
   depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery
   incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age,
   enhancing their current performance. In addition, electronics, using
   sensors and drones, support the data collection of several agriculture
   key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals and
   crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the
   use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture
   supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of
   Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse
   the behaviours and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the
   question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support a better supply chain
   decision-making process, or how can help to save time to farmer to make
   effective decision based on objective data, remains open. Therefore, in
   this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies
   and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted
   to understand the future paths of the Agri-Food domain. (C) 2020

Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},

Volume = {30},
Pages = {26-35},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In order to enhance customer's loyalty in a supply chain, many efforts
   could be done such as upgrading the service facilities and decreasing
   delivery time. Although these efforts need to extra-added cost, but we
   can reduce the shortage cost in supply chain. In this paper we consider
   a five-tier supply chain and assume that the lead time of manufacturers
   and warehouses can be shortened at an extra crashing cost, which depends
   on the length of lead time. Also we consider different options with
   different prices for product transportation between facilities. We
   formulate mixed integer non-linear model for a five-tiers supply chain
   with controllable lead time and multiple transportation options and
   develop a novel meta-heuristic method that combines the Taguchi's
   feature with Artificial Immune System (AIS) to solve the proposed model.
   The performance of the proposed solution method has been examined
   against a set of numeric instances and the obtained results are compared
   with those provided by AIS and the hybrid of Taguchi-genetic algorithm
   (GATA). Results indicate that the proposed method can provide better
   results than the previous solutions effectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Valuing quantity flexibility under supply chain disintermediation risk},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {180},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We consider a supply chain with one supplier and one retailer in which
   the parties develop a quantity flexibility contract to specify the
   conditions of procurement activities. The contract allows the retailer
   to adjust the initial order quantity after the partial or full
   resolution of demand uncertainty, which helps the retailer reduce
   supply-demand mismatches. We use the multiplicative martingale model of
   forecast evolution to analyze the impact of lead-time reduction on the
   value of quantity flexibility for the retailer. We find that the shorter
   the lead time, the higher the value of quantity flexibility. Quantity
   flexibility may, however, also cause supply chain disintermediation
   problems for the retailer, such as the supplier bypassing the retailer
   and selling its products directly to end customers. We incorporate the
   ``contracts as reference points{''} theory into our quantity flexibility
   contract model to capture the impact of supply chain disintermediation
   on the retailer's profit. This approach allows us to analyze the
   trade-off between decreasing supply-demand mismatches and increasing
   supply chain disintermediation problems. We show that the impact of
   lead-time reduction on decreasing the disintermediation risk highly
   depends on the critical fractile. We also find that the supplier's cost
   structure has a significant effect on the trade-off. When the supplier's
   initial investment cost is relatively low, the disintermediation
   problems become less important. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Carbon reduction in a supply chain via dynamic carbon emission quotas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {240},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {Due to increasing environmental pollution, governments have issued a
   series of policies to control carbon emissions. A carbon quota policy is
   one of them. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of the policy
   by examining its impact on supply chain members. This paper investigates
   emissions reduction in a supply chain under different carbon emission
   quotas in two stages. This paper constructs a supply chain model in
   three modes: (i) no carbon emission quota policy, (ii) the government
   implements the first stage of a carbon quota policy, and (iii) the
   government offers lower carbon quotas in the second stage. The analysis
   reveals that when the initial carbon quota allocated by the government
   meets certain conditions, the emission reduction rate in the first stage
   of the carbon quota policy is greater than that without the carbon quota
   policy; and an interesting finding is that the reduction rate further
   increases when the government reduces carbon quotas in the second stage.
   In addition to the reduction rate, the manufacturer's and the retailer's
   profits increase with consumers' preference for low-carbon products.
   With an increase of the decline parameter of free allocated carbon
   emission rights, the profits of both the manufacturer and the retailer
   decrease, but the profit of the manufacturer in the second stage is
   always lower than that in the first stage, whereas the retailer's profit
   is higher in the second stage than in the first stage. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Title = {A framework for understanding managerial responses to supply chain
   complexity},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS \& PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {1443-1466},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature of supply
   chain complexity and extend this with literature developed within the
   project domain. The authors use the lens of ambidexterity (the ability
   both to exploit and explore) to analyse responses to complexity, since
   this enables the authors to understand the application of known
   solutions in conjunction with innovative ones to resolve difficulties.
   This research also seeks to investigate how managers respond to supply
   chain complexities that can either be operationally deleterious or
   strategically beneficial.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors develop a descriptive framework
   based on the project management (PM) literature to understand response
   options to complexity, and then use interviews with supply chain
   managers in six organisations to examine the utility of this framework
   in practice. The authors ask the research question How do managers in
   supply chains respond to complexities?
   Findings The case study data show first that managers faced with
   structural, socio-political, or emergent supply chain complexities use a
   wide range of responses. Second, over a third of the instances of
   complexity coded were actually accommodated, rather than reduced, by the
   study firms, suggesting that adapting to supply chain complexity in
   certain instances may be strategically appropriate. Third, the lens of
   ambidexterity allows a more explicit assessment of whether existing PM
   solutions can be considered or if novel methods are required to address
   supply chain complexities.
   Practical implications The descriptive framework can aid managers in
   conceptualising and addressing supply chain complexity. Through
   exploiting current knowledge, managers can lessen the impact of
   complexity while exploring other innovative approaches to solve new
   problems and challenges that evolve from complexity growth driven by
   business strategy.
   Originality/value This study addresses a gap in the literature through
   the development of a framework which provides a structure on ways to
   address supply chain complexity. The authors evaluate an existing
   project complexity concept and demonstrate that it is both applicable
   and valuable in non-project, ongoing operations. The authors then extend
   it using the lens of ambidexterity, and develop a framework that can
   support practitioners in analysing and addressing both strategically
   necessary supply complexities, together with unwanted, negative
   complexities within the organisation and across the supply chain.},

Title = {Large-scale regionalised LCA shows that plant-based fat spreads have a
   lower climate, land occupation and water scarcity impact than dairy
   butter},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1043-1058},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose In light of the sustainable diet debate, we conducted a
   large-scale regionalised LCA to answer the following questions: (i) does
   the climate advantage hypothesis of plant-based fat spreads and creams
   over dairy butter and cream hold regardless of the variabilities of
   product recipes, geographies and the influence of land use change (LUC)?
   (ii) Considering the climate-water-land nexus, is there a risk of
   shifting impacts from climate to water scarcity and land occupation, and
   what are the key opportunities for impact mitigation? Methods A
   framework for conducting a large-scale regionalised LCA was developed
   and applied to compare the environmental impacts of 212 plant-based fat
   spreads, 16 plant-based creams and 40 dairy alternatives sold in 21
   countries per 1 kg of product. Data was compiled for different product
   recipes, key ingredient sourcing countries, production factory
   locations, energy mixes, packaging designs, transportation and
   end-of-life scenarios. Spatially (archetype) differentiated agricultural
   life cycle inventory data were generated, as well as LUC emissions for
   agricultural ingredients. A total of 18 environmental indicators were
   assessed. Results and discussion All plant-based spreads had a
   significantly lower climate impact than butter, with and without LUC
   inclusion. The regionalised analysis highlighted large variabilities
   across products, ranging from 0.98 to 6.93 (mean 3.3) kg CO2-eq for 212
   plant-based spreads and 8.08 to 16.93 (mean 12.1) kg CO2-eq for 21 dairy
   butter with 95th confidence interval. The main drivers of GHG emissions
   for plant-based products are oilseed farming and the associated LUC
   emissions, which can vary significantly depending on type of oilseeds,
   quantity and sourcing country; in the worst-case scenario, the climate
   advantage is no longer valid due to LUC. Thus, the inclusion of LUC is
   essential for a robust assessment and hotspot identification. Overall,
   the risk of shifting impact was small, as most of the plant-based
   spreads also had lower impacts for water scarcity footprints and land
   occupation; 8 of the 212 products were not lower, due to oilseed
   ingredients with high embodied impacts. Conclusions This study confirmed
   that plant-based spreads had lower climate, water and land impacts than
   butter, despite variability of product recipes, geographies and
   influence of LUC. This research offers a framework for performing
   regionalised agricultural LCA for a large portfolio of products thereby
   enabling identification of inter-product variabilities and hotspots for
   the development of mitigation strategies. Key mitigation opportunities
   include reducing oilseed ingredients' embodied impacts by optimising
   product recipe design and adapting supply chain sourcing and
   agricultural practice.},

Pages = {1541-1561},

Abstract = {As disruptions and uncertainty have become emergent themes within the
   supply chain literature, attention has shifted towards the choices
   enacted to combat the negative effects of disruptions. Extant research
   highlights the importance of system states - namely robustness and
   resilience - towards mitigating the probability and magnitude of
   disruptions, however, there appears to be a lack of conceptual guidance
   surrounding two popular strategies - redundancy and flexibility - that
   have been proposed to mitigate the impact of disruptions. To address
   this issue, we review and investigate contextual factors from empirical
   research that may offer insight into conceptual strategies that can be
   utilised to improve post-disruption system performance utilising a
   methodology based upon an abductive approach to conceptual theory
   building. In this paper published research on resilience and robustness
   in supply chains is considered, alongside research in other areas such
   as risk, systems theory, and ecology. Inference drawn from empirical
   research is often highly contextualised, but collectively highlights
   unique generalisable factors. Our research proposes four broad
   conceptual strategies - insurance, expediting, strategic adaptive
   capability and reconfiguration - that each uniquely serve to reduce the
   probability and magnitude of supply chain disruptions. Our research
   concludes that the difference in utility between redundancy and
   flexibility as means to enhance resilience and robustness is influenced
   by interactions between the supply chain, the disruption characteristics
   (inclusive of speed of onset and time horizon) and the decision maker.},

Title = {Mathematical models for the trimethylamine (TMA) formation on packed cod
   fish fillets at different temperatures},
Journal = {FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {272-278},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The microbial formation of trimethylamine (TMA) can be used as a quality
   indicator compound to predict the freshness of fish during its shelf
   life. In a supply chain with fluctuating temperatures, mathematical
   models will be valuable tools to simulate this formation as a function
   of temperature and time. These models are essential to link sensor data
   on the formation of TMA to the actual freshness of fish. Existing models
   for the formation of TMA in fish needed improvements and secondary
   models for the effect of temperature on the formation of TMA are lacking
   in the literature. Three different approaches were evaluated on their
   ability to simulate the experimental observed TMA formation at 4
   different temperatures (0, 5, 10 and 15 degrees C). In the first
   approach the existing models were improved and the temperature effect
   was modelled by an empirical model using four parameters. This model is
   able to simulate the TMA formation at static temperatures. Since TMA is
   produced on fresh cod fillets by the micro-organisms Shewanella
   putrefaciens and Photobacterium phosphoreum the microbial
   Baranyi-Roberts model was initially used for modelling the TMA
   formation, but this model was found to be too complex (too many
   correlated parameters that could not be estimated). In the third
   approach it was seen that a simplified Baranyi-Roberts model with only
   three parameters could be used to predict the TMA formation with equal
   accuracy. The influence of the temperature on the parameter mu(max) was
   modelled using the extended square root model of Ratkowsky and the
   differences in TMA formation profiles of different batches could be
   described by the batch specific parameter N-0 representing the initial
   quality. The presented dynamic model is valuable in predicting the
   formation of TMA in a fresh fish supply chain with dynamic temperatures.
   This model has the potential to be used to link sensor data of TMA in
   the headspace to the actual freshness status of the fish. (C) 2014

Title = {Two-period supply chain with flexible trade credit contract},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {95-105},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {This paper studies a two-period supply chain that consists of a retailer
   and a supplier. A newsvendorlike retailer is capital constrained and
   orders products using a supplier's trade credits to satisfy uncertain
   market demand. Most existing studies show that the retailer always
   postpones payment until the due date. To recall the loans earlier, we
   present a case in which the supplier, as a Stackelberg leader, offers an
   incentive of a discounted wholesale price in the second order to entice
   the retailer to choose flexible early payment. The proposed incentive is
   related to the retailer's early payment time in the first period. In the
   presence of bankruptcy risks for both the retailer and supplier, we
   propose a continuous newsvendor model of a two-period supply chain to
   analyze the decisions involved in the flexible trade credit contract.
   The analytic forms confirm that such an incentive can improve the
   decentralized supply chain efficiency and decreases the supplier's trade
   credit risk. The retailer always prefers early payment to payment around
   the due date to increase revenues. Furthermore, the action of paying
   early might help the retailer adjust cash flow between the two periods.
   We also find that a revenue sharing contract significantly affects the
   retailer's payment behavior and supplier's wholesale price. The
   numerical simulations support our results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   producers in Australia and the results of stepwise multiple regression
   analysis revealed that performance flexibility was significantly
   influenced by the supply chain practices: customer relationships and
   information quality (IQ). Given these findings, beef producers should
   focus on customer relationships and IQ in order to achieve enhanced
   flexibility in their SCP. The paper discusses the implications and
   current practices in beef cattle farming industry.},

Title = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT MATURITY: AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING LITERATURE REVIEW
   ON MODELS, DIMENSIONS AND APPROACHES},
Journal = {LOGFORUM},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {103-116},
Abstract = {Background: In recent years, organizational maturity has disseminated
   its concepts to various management domains, for instance, Supply Chain
   Management (SCM). The present paper is an attempt to review the
   developments in the realm of SCM over the past two decades. In the
   domain of SCM maturity, different models, dimensions (areas) and
   approaches are advanced for maturity measurements.
   Methods: Research studies conducted and presented in the literature,
   including papers on conference proceedings, articles in journals and
   technical reports, are reviewed; the review covers a time span from the
   early 1990s to the present time (2019). Also provided in this review are
   the previous models, dimensions (areas/ elements), and approaches for
   measuring SCM maturity techniques. Additionally, research gaps are
   identified, analysed and discussed.
   Results: After reviewing, the research studies in the field and the
   dimensions found in the works are placed into different categories. The
   current study aims to present a review of the literature, ultimately
   providing help to researchers in realizing gaps and opportunities in the
   field of SCM maturity. There are also different approaches to supply
   chain maturity models. For example, one approach may solely focus on
   integration while another might concentrate on SC visibility and
   traceability. In more recent research studies, more attention is paid to
   such specific areas of supply chain as flexibility and sustainability.
   The results of the present paper point to gaps, which indicate that more
   research works are required. In addition, it is assumed that the
   materials presented here may help establish more comprehensive SCM
   maturity models.
   Conclusions: It is seen that supply chain management is rapidly shifting
   toward e-SCM, and some other technologies like blockchain. Also, supply
   chain sustainability comes to the fore as a significant approach. It
   should be reminded that other strategic features of supply chains like
   leanness, agility, resilience, sustainability, integration, green and
   reverse logistics etc., also play their own role in the field. Combining
   these strategic features can be an effective idea for developing more
   comprehensive models for SCM maturity. To sum up, the results of the
   present survey indicate that the published works need more adequacy and
   treatment research, and that more research is called for to bridge the
   gaps in the realm of SCM maturity.},

   confronted with different internal and external risks. The purpose of
   this study is to investigate and find the key factors affecting the
   resilience of the supply chain of medical equipment and to examine the
   dynamic relations among these factors. Design/methodology/approach A
   hybrid methodology is used for meeting the purpose of this study. First,
   the Delphi method is extended by using hesitant fuzzy linguistic term
   sets to identify the key factors of supply chain resilience. At the
   second phase, using the system dynamic methodology, the dynamic
   relations among identified resilience factors are analyzed. Findings
   Using the Delphi method, agility, collaboration among actors, sharing of
   information, trust among actors, explicitness of supply chain, risk
   management culture, adaptability, structure, funding and environment
   conditions are identified as ten major factors affecting medical
   equipment's supply chain resilience. Also, four scenarios are simulated
   along with their impacts on the system. Originality/value The main
   contribution of this study is extending a hesitant fuzzy linguistic term
   sets-based Delphi and applying it along a system dynamic analysis to
   identify the key factors affecting resilience of medical equipment's

Abstract = {This paper develops a digital supply chain game, modeling marketing and

   concerns a comparison between static and dynamic solutions of the supply

   Therefore, this study proposes centralized and decentralized versions of
   the game, comparing their solutions under static and dynamic settings.
   Moreover, it investigates the decentralized supply chain by evaluating
   two smart contracts: Revenue sharing and wholesale price contracts. In
   both cases, the firms use an artificial intelligence system to determine
   the optimal contract parameters. Numerical and qualitative analyses are
   used for comparing configurations (centralized, decentralized), settings
   (static, dynamic), and contract schemes (revenue sharing contract,
   wholesale price contract). The findings identify the conditions under
   which smart revenue sharing mechanisms are worth applying.},

Title = {Simultaneous control of vehicle routing and inventory for dynamic
   inbound supply chain},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {65},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1001-1008},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper investigates inbound logistics for an OEM (Original Equipment
   Manufacturing) manufacturer, who aims at short production time and JIT
   policy. In such a case, it can be argued that the inbound vehicle
   routing schedule should be combined with incoming parts inventory
   control. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous control method of
   combining vehicle scheduling and inventory control for such dynamic
   inbound logistics. For the transportation control, a vehicle routing
   system, in which delivery jobs are made with shipments of one supplier,
   is proposed to generate a vehicle routes plan by considering production
   start time, travel time, waiting time, and loading/unloading time. To
   evaluate the performance of the generated vehicle routing plan, a goal
   model is also developed by considering vehicle operating cost, stock
   level exceeding penalty, and transportation efficiency. A generated
   vehicle routing plan can be rejected when the stock level is over the
   capacity and an appropriate number of vehicles for its manufacturing
   environment can be determined. Using real data from an LCD firm, a
   simulation study is conducted. The simulation results indicate that the
   simultaneous control approach requires fewer vehicles than the existing
   system and shows better efficiency of transportation. This method can
   also be used to determine the appropriate incoming part inventory level
   or the number of vehicles required in dynamic inbound logistics. (C)

Abstract = {Recognizing trust as the basis for firm cooperation, we investigate how
   a trust mechanism affects a supply chain network using a dynamic

   preferred random rule. We use this model to explore the impact of the
   three rules on supply chain performance and bankruptcy propagation under
   the conditions of external disruption, bank rate, and new firms entering
   the market. Our results identify the preferred trust rule as the
   supplier selection method that can in most cases best improve the total
   revenue of the whole supply chain network. In terms of firm bankruptcy,
   on the other hand, it is the preferred random rule that has the least
   impact and the preferred price rule that has the most. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   chain model},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {200},
Pages = {290-302},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {A viable hydrogen infrastructure is one of the main challenges for fuel
   cells in mobile applications. Several studies have investigated the most
   cost-efficient hydrogen supply chain structure, with a focus on hydrogen
   transportation. However, supply chain models based on hydrogen produced
   by electrolysis require additional seasonal hydrogen storage capacity to
   close the gap between fluctuation in renewable generation from surplus
   electricity and fuelling station demand. To address this issue, we
   developed a model that draws on and extends approaches in the literature
   with respect to long-term storage. Thus, we analyse Liquid Organic
   Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) and show their potential impact on future
   hydrogen mobility. We demonstrate that LOHC-based pathways are highly
   promising especially for smaller-scale hydrogen demand and if storage in
   salt caverns remains uncompetitive, but emit more greenhouse gases (GHG)
   than other gaseous or hydrogen ones. Liquid hydrogen as a seasonal
   storage medium offers no advantage compared to LOHC or cavern storage
   since lower electricity prices for flexible operation cannot balance the
   investment costs of liquefaction plants. A well-to-wheel analysis
   indicates that all investigated pathways have less than 30\%
   GHG-emissions compared to conventional fossil fuel pathways within a
   European framework. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {In this paper we consider a non-cooperative N players differential game
   affected by deterministic uncertainties. Sufficient conditions for the
   existence of a robust feedback Nash equilibrium are presented in a set
   of min-max forms of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Such conditions
   are then used to find the robust Nash controls for a linear affine
   quadratic game affected by a square integrable uncertainty, which is
   seen as a malicious fictitious player trying to maximize the cost
   function of each player. The approach allows us to find robust
   strategies in the solution of a group of coupled Riccati differential
   equation. The finite, as well as infinite, time horizon cases are solved
   for this last game. As an illustration of the approach, the problem of
   the coordination of a two-echelon supply chain with seasonal uncertain
   fluctuations in demand is developed.},

Title = {Exploring information sharing in the extended supply chain: an
   interdependence perspective},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {455-470},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to empirically explore demand-related
   information sharing in the extended supply chain.
   Design/methodology/approach - Through a single, embedded case design, a
   range of methods are used to collect data from companies representing
   three different supply chain tiers, including focal company, first-tier
   suppliers and first-tier customers. The collected data are analysed
   through the theoretical lens of interdependence.
   Findings - The findings indicate that the supply chain actors adapt
   information sharing to the pooled, serial or reciprocal type of
   interdependence. Information sharing is thus increased with key dyadic
   partners representing, for example, unique offerings and high market
   shares as percentage of total expenditure/sales. The study also unearths
   several barriers to information sharing beyond dyadic ties, including
   problems related to dis-aggregated, misinterpreted and/or incomplete
   information.
   Research limitations/implications - The study empirically contributes to
   the existing literature by exploring information sharing in the extended
   supply chain and by suggesting different approaches to information
   sharing depending on the type and intensity of interdependence between
   supply chain partners. Further, the paper contributes to the existing
   literature on barriers of information sharing in supply chains by
   identifying barriers specific to multi-tier information sharing.
   ``Meta-information{''} (i.e. information about the shared information)
   is needed to overcome some of the barriers of sharing information in
   cases of weak, pooled interdependencies in the supply chain.
   Practical implications - Similar to previous empirical research, this
   exploratory study indicates that companies, in general, refrain from
   sharing information beyond dyadic ties. Supply chain managers would
   instead mostly focus on stronger, reciprocal interdependencies and
   emphasise dyadic information sharing. To further guide managers, a
   demand profiling framework considering market share and demand
   uncertainty is presented. It may be interesting to engage in multi-tier
   information sharing in particular cases where strong interdependence
   exists between three or more partners.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to existing research on
   information sharing in supply chains by empirically studying information
   sharing in an extended supply chain, applying interdependence theory as
   its analytical framework and unearthing several barriers that are
   specific to multi-tier information sharing.},

Abstract = {A successful supply chain management (SCM) should aim to maximize the

Title = {Omnichannel Strategy and Consumer Behavior in Distribution Channels:
   Trends in the Ophthalmology Sector},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {Changes in consumer behavior are forcing companies to rapidly shift
   their distribution channels toward an omnichannel model. In the case of
   the ophthalmology sector, however, the purchase of contact lenses and
   prescription glasses requires professional examination by a trained eye
   specialist. This peculiarity of the sector affects the shift toward
   omnichannel. This paper is novel in that it addresses a research gap by
   studying the distribution channels for regulated products and services
   such as health products that required a closer professional service.
   This paper addresses the transformation of companies toward an
   omnichannel model using a common scientific forecasting method (i.e.,
   the Delphi method) to identify trends and problems. In this scenario of
   high complexity and uncertainty where there is insufficient relevant
   quantitative information for decision making, the Delphi method is
   applied to ensure a consensual decision-making process. Consensus was
   reached by a panel of 11 experts on the Spanish ophthalmology sector
   after three rounds of questioning. The final set of indicators involve
   19 different criteria grouped into four categories (1) current situation
   of the distribution channel, (2) changes in distribution channels, (3)
   trends and near future of the distribution channel, and (4) consequences
   and adaptations for supply chain agents. The results from each round of
   consultation were then analyzed by means of statistical analysis with
   SPSS and discussed for each category. The results confirm that
   traditional intermediaries face difficulties to avoid being squeezed out
   of the sector because of shortening distribution channels and the entry
   of new online intermediaries with service integration models. We
   identify future scenarios and define actions that different agents can
   take to enhance their competitiveness in the short and long term. The
   arrival of omnichannel distribution is inevitable in the ophthalmology
   sector, entailing a major transformation from a rigid traditional
   distribution model to a more complex and flexible model following the
   entry of new online intermediaries.},

Title = {Hybrid Electromagnetism-Like Algorithm for Dynamic Supply Chain Network
   Design under Traffic Congestion and Uncertainty},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {With the constantly increasing pressure of the competitive environment,
   supply chain (SC) decision makers are forced to consider several aspects
   of business climate. More specifically, they should take into account
   the endogenous features (e.g., available means of transportation, and
   the variety of products) and exogenous criteria (e.g., the environmental
   uncertainty, and transportation system conditions). In this paper, a
   mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for dynamic design of
   a supply chain network is proposed. In this model, multiple products and
   multiple transportation modes, the time value of money, traffic
   congestion, and both supply-side and demand-side uncertainties are
   considered. Due to the complexity of such models, conventional solution
   methods are not applicable; therefore, two hybrid Electromagnetism-Like
   Algorithms (EMA) are designed and discussed for tackling the problem.
   The numerical results show the applicability of the proposed model and
   the capabilities of the solution approaches to the MINLP problem.},

Abstract = {Supply chain management has become more important as an academic topic
   due to trends in globalization leading to massive reallocation of
   production related advantages. Because of the massive amount of data
   that is generated in the global economy, new tools need to be developed
   in order to manage and analyze the data, as well as to monitor
   organizational performance worldwide. This paper proposes a framework of
   business analytics for supply chain analytics (SCA) as IT-enabled,
   analytical dynamic capabilities composed of data management capability,
   analytical supply chain process capability, and supply chain performance
   management capability. This paper also presents a dynamic-capabilities
   view of SCA and extensively describes a set of its three capabilities:
   data management capability, analytical supply chain process capability,
   and supply chain performance management capability. Next, using the SCM
   best practice, sales \& operations planning (S\&OP), the paper
   demonstrates opportunities to apply SCA in an integrated way. In
   discussing the implications of the proposed framework, finally, the

Title = {Risk interaction identification in international supply chain logistics:
   Developing a holistic model},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS \& PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {372-389},
Abstract = {Purpose International supply chains can be severely disrupted by
   failures in international logistics processes. Therefore, an
   understanding of international logistics risks, or causes of failure,
   how these may interact with each other and how they can be mitigated are
   imperatives for the smooth operation of international supply chains. The
   purpose of this paper is to specifically investigate the interactions
   between international logistics risks within the prevailing structures
   of international supply chains and highlights how these risks may be
   inter-connected and amplified. A new dynamic supply chain logistics risk
   analysis model is proposed which is novel as it provides a holistic
   understanding of the risk event interactivity.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper applies interpretive structural
   modelling to data collected from a survey of leading supply chain
   practitioners, in order to analyse their perspectives of risk elements
   and interactions. The risk elements and their contextual relationship
   were derived empirically through the use of focus groups and subsequent
   Delphi study. The two stages of the research rely on experts' views on
   risk events and clusters and the level of interactions among those
   clusters.
   Findings A key finding of this research is that supply chain
   practitioner's perception of risk consists of inter-connected four
   levels: value streams risks; information and relationship risks; risks
   in international supply chain activities; and external environment. In
   particular, since level 2 risk creates feedback loops of risks, risk
   management at level 2 can dampen the amplification effect and the
   strength of the interactions.
   Practical implications Several managerial implications are drawn. First,
   the research guides managers in the identification and evaluation of
   risk events which can impact the performance of their international
   logistics supply chain operations. Second, evidence is presented that
   supports the proposition that the relationships with trading partners
   and LSPs, and the degree of logistics information exchange, are critical
   to prevent, or at least mitigate, logistics risks which can
   substantially affect the responsiveness of the international supply
   chain.
   Originality/value The main contribution to knowledge that this study
   offers to the literature on supply chain risk management is the
   development of a supply chain logistics risk analysis model which
   includes both risk elements and interactions. The research demonstrates
   the importance of taking into account risk interactions in the process
   of identification and evaluation of risk events.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we develop a four-stage procedure for evaluating and
   improving a supplier's volume flexibility. In the first stage, we use
   historical demand data to develop a model for forecasting their future
   quantities. In the next stage, we develop an algorithm for smoothing the
   forecasted future demands. We show that applying this algorithm not only
   reduces production fluctuations and damages, but also improves the
   flexibility of the supplier and hence the overall supply chain. We
   investigate the economical conditions of applying this algorithm. In the
   third stage, by considering the forecasted future demands, we develop a
   mathematical single-period flexibility measure. In the fourth stage, the
   developed measure is extended to a multi-period model for applying in
   the multi-period supply collaborations and especially in the VMI
   systems. Furthermore, we consider weight coefficients for taking into
   account the different importance of flexibility from the buyer's
   perspective over the time horizon. By applying in a real case study
   about an oil refinery, we verify the developed model and investigate the
   effects of its parameters through the sensitivity analysis.},

Title = {Supply chain resilience: an adaptive cycle approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {443-463},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework
   for extending an understanding of resilience in complex adaptive system
   (CAS) such as supply chains using the adaptive cycle framework. The
   adaptive cycle framework may help explain change and the long term
   dynamics and resilience in supply chain networks. Adaptive cycles assume
   that dynamic systems such as supply chain networks go through stages of
   growth, development, collapse and reorientation. Adaptive cycles suggest
   that the resilience of a complex adaptive system such as supply chains
   are not fixed but expand and contract over time and resilience requires
   such systems to navigate each of the cycles' four stages successfully.
   Design/methodology/approach This research uses the adaptive cycle
   framework to explain supply chain resilience (SCRES). It explores the
   phases of the adaptive cycle, its pathologies and key properties and
   links these to competences and behaviors that are important for system
   and SCRES. The study develops a conceptual framework linking adaptive
   cycles to SCRES. The goal is to extend dynamic theories of SCRES by
   borrowing from the adaptive cycle framework. We review the literature on
   the adaptive cycle framework, its properties and link these to SCRES.
   Findings The key insight is that the adaptive cycle concept can broaden
   our understanding of SCRES beyond focal scales, including cross-scale
   resilience. As a framework, the adaptive cycle can explain the
   mechanisms that support or prevent resilience in supply chains. Adaptive
   cycles may also give us new insights into the sort of competences
   required to avoid stagnation, promote system renewal as resilience
   expands and contracts over time. Research limitations/implications The
   adaptive cycle may move our discussion of resilience beyond engineering
   and ecological resilience to include evolutionary resilience. While the
   first two presently dominates our theorizing on SCRES, evolutionary
   resilience may be more insightful than both are. Adaptive cycles capture
   the idea of change, adaptation and transformation and allow us to
   explore cross-scale resilience. Practical implications Knowing how to
   prepare for and overcoming key pathologies associated with each stage of
   the adaptive cycle can broaden our repertoire of strategies for managing
   SCRES across time. Human agency is important for preventing systems from
   crossing critical thresholds into imminent collapse. More importantly,
   disruptions may present an opportunity for innovation and renewal for
   building more resilience supply chains. Originality/value This research
   is one of the few studies that have applied the adaptive cycle concept
   to SCRES and extends our understanding of the dynamic structure of SCRES},

Abstract = {The paper investigates the extent to which capacity investment
   considerations interact with the double marginalization effect in a
   simple supply chain governed by a wholesale price contract. To do so, a
   non-cooperative differential game model is formulated to study the
   pricing and capacity investment decisions in a supply chain, which
   consists of a supplier and a manufacturer. In such a game, there are
   different decision rules open-loop, closed-loop, feedback that are
   available to the supply chain participants, depending on the
   observability of the current state of the supply chain. While
   closed-loop and feedback equilibrium strategies involve the
   observability of other chain member's production capacity, open-loop
   equilibrium strategies do not have such requirement. We examine how the
   supplier and the manufacturer determine, with the different decision
   rules, their production capacities and pricing policies to maximize
   their profits over an infinite planning horizon, and determine how the
   observability of other supply chain's members' production capacity
   affects the magnitude of the double marginalization effect. Our study
   suggests that the observability of other chain member's current
   production capacity entails a lower production efficiency that results
   in a greater double marginalization effect. This allows us to conclude
   that observability of other chain member's current production capacity
   is associated with a greater double marginalization effect.},

Journal = {OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {185-198},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Supply chains often experience significant economic losses from
   disruptions such as facility breakdowns, transportation mishaps, natural
   calamities, and intentional attacks. To help respond and recover from a
   disruption, we investigate adjustments in order activity across four
   echelons including assembly. Simulation experiments reveal that the
   impact of a disruption depends on its location, with costlier and longer
   lasting impacts occurring from disruptions at echelons close to ultimate
   consumption. Cost functions based on system inventory and service can be
   quite ill-behaved in these complex problem settings. Expediting, an
   adaptive ordering approach often used to mitigate disruptions, can
   trigger unintended bullwhip effects, and hurt rather than help overall
   performance. As an alternative to expediting interventions, dynamic
   order-up-to policies show promise as an adaptive mitigation tool. We
   also find benefits in the dynamic policies from incorporating a
   metaheuristic parameter search over multiple echelons, yielding
   significantly better solution quality than embedded unimodal search. (C)

Abstract = {In Supply chain (SC) environments, schedules inevitably experience
   various unexpected disruptions. In these cases, rescheduling is
   essential to minimise the negative impact on the performance of the
   system. In this study, a hybrid rescheduling technique is developed for
   solving coordinated manufacturing tasks scheduling problems with due
   date changes and machine breakdowns. According to the dynamic features
   of this problem, a strategy combined with event and periodic driven
   methods is proposed to improve the stability and robustness of
   manufacturing performance in a coordinated SC. Moreover, an application
   case is introduced to test and evaluate the effect of different
   initialisations in two types of disruption scenarios. The experimental
   results show that the proposed rescheduling technique has good
   effectiveness and efficiency in the coordinated manufacturing

Abstract = {Through the development and usage of an agent-based model, this article
   investigates firms' adaptive strategies against disruptions in a supply
   chain network. Viewing supply chain networks as complex adaptive
   systems, we first construct and analyze a real-world supply chain
   network among 2,971 firms spanning 90 industry sectors. We then develop
   an agent-based simulation to show how the model of firms' adaptive
   behaviors can leverage competition relationships within a supply chain
   network. The simulation also models how disruptions propagate in the
   supply chain network through cascading failures. With the simulation, we
   seek to understand if a firm's adaptive behaviors can reduce the impact
   of disruptions in supply chain networks. Therefore, we propose,
   evaluate, and analyze two types of adaptive strategies a firm can
   leverage to reduce the negative effects of supply chain network
   disruptions. First, we deploy in our model a reactive strategy, which
   restructures the network in response to a disruption event among
   first-tier suppliers. Next, we develop and propose proactive strategies,
   which are used when a distant disruption is observed but has not yet hit
   the focal firm. We discuss the implications related to how and when
   firms can improve their resilience against supply disruptions by
   leveraging adaptive strategies.},

Abstract = {There is a need to identify and categorise different types of
   nonlinearities that commonly appear in supply chain dynamics models, as
   well as establishing suitable methods for linearising and analysing each
   type of nonlinearity. In this paper simplification methods to reduce
   model complexity and to assist in gaining system dynamics insights are
   suggested. Hence, an outcome is the development of more accurate
   simplified linear representations of complex nonlinear supply chain
   models.
   We use the highly cited Forrester production-distribution model as a
   benchmark supply chain system to study nonlinear control structures and
   apply appropriate analytical control theory methods. We then compare
   performances of the linearised model with numerical solutions of the
   original nonlinear model and with other previous research on the same
   model.
   Findings suggest that more accurate linear approximations can be found.
   These simplified and linearised models enhance the understanding of the
   system dynamics and transient responses, especially for inventory and
   shipment responses. A systematic method is provided for the rigorous
   analysis and design of nonlinear supply chain dynamics models,
   especially when overly simplistic linear relationship assumptions are
   not possible or appropriate. This is a precursor to robust control
   system optimisation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Enhancing the proactive strategic capabilities to withstand the most
   unfavourable circumstances is always appreciated as a long-term policy
   rather than incident-based responses. The present research is positioned
   on this fundamental notion of supply chain risk management with a
   particular focus on strategic capabilities like reliability and
   flexibility that often conflict with cost. Accordingly, the authors
   propose a multi-objective mathematical model for designing a
   four-echelon supply chain that optimises cost, reliability, and volume
   flexibility. Interestingly, this research is the maiden effort to
   optimise the supply chain with these trifold objectives and herein lies
   the novelty as well as the challenges. Consequently, a genetic algorithm
   based approach is utilised as the solution methodology. To demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed method, the small problem instances
   and the four-echelon problems have also been validated through exact
   methods and simulated annealing algorithm, respectively. A case study on
   a footwear supply chain involving three echelons is also presented to
   showcase the industrial applicability and adaptability of the proposed
   model. A fuzzy TOPSIS method has been adopted in the case study to
   incorporate the expert opinion for assigning priorities to the
   objectives. Supply chain professionals can leverage this methodology to
   establish a risk resistant supply chain.},

Pages = {6984-6996},
Abstract = {Considering the need for more effective decision support in the context
   of distributed manufacturing, this paper develops an advanced analytics
   framework for configuring supply chain (SC) networks. The proposed
   framework utilises a distributed multi-agent system architecture to
   deploy fuzzy rough sets-based algorithms for knowledge elicitation and
   representation. A set of historical sales data, including network
   node-related information, is used together with the relevant details of
   product families to predict SC configurations capable of fulfilling
   desired customer orders. Multiple agents such as data retrieval agent,
   knowledge acquisition agent, knowledge representation agent,
   configuration predictor agent, evaluator agent and dispatching agent are
   used to help execute a broad spectrum of SC configuration decisions. The
   proposed framework considers multiple product variants and sourcing
   options at each network node, as well as multiple performance
   objectives. It also captures decisions that span the entire SC
   simultaneously and, by implication, represents multiple network links.
   Using an industry test case, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of
   the proposed framework in terms of fulfilling customer orders with lower
   production and emissions costs, compared to the results generated using

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {218},
Pages = {72-82},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper investigates whether a supply chain can achieve coordination
   by implementing two mechanisms: a cooperative advertising program and a
   price discount mechanism. We start by analyzing a consignment contract
   with a revenue-sharing agreement in which a manufacturer decides both
   the price and the quality investment while the retailer sets the store
   advertising efforts. The manufacturer is the brand owner and increases
   the goodwill through quality and pricing. We solve three dynamic games,
   in which the manufacturer is the Stackelberg leader, and compare the
   related solutions. We discover that the manufacturer, as chain leader,
   will always propose the adoption of a coordination mechanism. When the
   manufacturer opts for a cooperative program, the retailer is always
   economically better off; thus, a cooperative program is always
   profit-Pareto-improving. When the manufacturer opts for a price discount
   mechanism, the retailer is always economically worse-off because the
   discount applies only to her margins. Nevertheless, the price discount
   mechanism is profit-Pareto-improving in the case of high production
   cost: The price discount allows for considerably reducing the retail
   price, which translates to a substantial increase in demand. In all
   other cases, the retailer sets zero price discount, thus preferring a
   non-coordinated framework.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {696-714},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this research is to develop a conceptual
   framework in which dynamic capabilities (DCs) for the creation of
   logistics flexibility are outlined, and elaborate it further based on
   empirical data from a case study at a Swedish fast fashion retailer.
   Design/methodology/approach A conceptual framework that aims to
   delineate the relationship between generic classes of DCs and logistics
   flexibility is proposed. Thereafter, based on a theory elaboration
   approach, empirical data from a case study at a Swedish fast fashion
   retailer is used to identify more specific DCs and further outline the
   characteristics of the DCs classes. Findings The proposed framework
   draws on the three DC classes of sensing, seizing and reconfiguring, and
   how they underscore logistics range and logistics response flexibility.
   The framework also distinguishes between DC classes and logistics
   flexibility that occur at operational, structural and strategic levels.
   DCs for the creation of logistics flexibility at a Swedish fast fashion
   retailer have also been identified and described as a means to further
   elaborate the characteristics of the DC classes. Research
   limitations/implications Current empirical data is limited to one
   specific company context. Practical implications The research presents a
   systematic and comprehensive map of different DCs that underscore
   logistics flexibility, a useful tool supporting logistics development
   efforts regarding flexibility. Originality/value The establishment of a
   more detailed DC lens, in which different classes of DCs are included,
   means that an improved understanding for how flexibility is created can
   be achieved. It helps the research to move beyond the ``here and now{''}
   existence of logistics flexibility to instead focus on how logistics
   flexibility can be created.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the dynamic optimization of a low-carbon supply chain
   consisting of a manufacturer and a capital-constrained retailer.
   Considering market randomness and accumulation of production experience,
   a Stackelberg differential game model is constructed. In the game, the
   manufacturer is the leader and its pricing and emission reduction
   strategies over time are deduced in farsighted and myopic behaviors,
   respectively. In both behaviors, the emission reduction increases over
   time and a relatively low/high carbon price leads to
   skimming/penetrating pricing strategy of the manufacturer. Numerical
   study shows that the manufacturer must adopt a farsighted behavior for
   profit seeking except that consumers' low-carbon awareness is quite low,
   and the retailer also prefers the manufacturer to adopt this behavior.
   Increasing carbon price and consumers' low-carbon awareness benefits the
   manufacturer rather than the retailer. The governments can take measures
   to raise the carbon price to reduce the environmental impact.},

Abstract = {This study examines the dynamic performance of vertically decentralized
   two-echelon channel coordination for deteriorating goods under
   consignment and vendor-managed inventory (VMI) contracts with revenue
   sharing from retailer-centric business-to-business transactions in both

   the profit-maximization problem and devises a method for making
   cross-enterprise dynamic joint decisions by combining calculus with
   dynamic programming for a retailer-led Stackelberg supply chain under
   cooperative and non-cooperative game settings over a multi-period
   planning horizon. The applicability of the proposed model is assessed
   using a case study involving a highly perishable product, sliced raw
   fish, in a supply chain comprising a regional seafood supplier and a
   local store belonging to a large national retail chain. The analytical
   results show that, in a cooperative setting, the EM with a consigned
   revenue-sharing VMI contract tends to achieve lower retail prices,
   larger stock quantity, improved channel efficiency, and increases in
   both retailer and supplier profits through an additional one-part
   tariff. Additionally, consumers benefit from lower retail prices and
   society benefits from increased overall channel profits in the
   cooperative channel and EM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Industry 4.0 digital technologies are becoming indispensable for firms
   striving to enhance their supply chain capabilities and financial
   performance, but how these relationships play out in practice remains
   unclear. To address this issue, this study assesses the relationship
   between supply chain integration, supply chain agility, and financial
   performance from a dynamic capability perspective. Further analyses are
   conducted to establish whether Industry 4.0 digital technologies
   moderate the association between (a) supply chain integration and supply
   chain agility and (b) supply chain agility and financial performance.
   Findings based on the data pertaining to a sample of 274 Swedish
   manufacturing firms indicate that supply chain agility fully mediates
   the link between supply chain integration and financial performance.
   However, while Industry 4.0 digital technologies strengthen the effect
   of supply chain agility on financial performance, they do not moderate
   the relationship between supply chain integration and supply chain
   agility. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate regarding how
   digital technologies play a role in achieving competitive advantage in
   interplay with dynamic capabilities related to the supply chain. These
   findings are relevant for decision-makers, as they address the need for

Abstract = {Nowadays, it is necessary to paying attention to the opportunities and
   threats in the field of industry and trade, and evaluate the ability of
   industries and companies in dealing with uncertainties and existing
   risks, and it is very important to manage supply chain risk. The main
   purpose of this study is to be careful against risky suppliers and
   reducing the injury rate in the event of a disruption. Therefore, in
   this regard, a multi-stage mixed integer programming model with a
   proactive approach has been used; that in the first stage, the model
   reports the amount of supply from suppliers without considering the risk
   criterion, and at the same time, it seeks to optimal state of
   minimization the supply chain costs (including purchase cost, shipping,
   maintenance, supplier selection and return goods). In the second stage,
   after the suppliers which supplying the parts, have been identified, the
   model seeks to minimize the identified risks of suppliers under
   different scenarios. In the third stage, the model tries to achieve an
   optimal state of supplying the parts from less risky suppliers. In the
   continuation of this study, an integrated multi-objective programming
   model has been designed, which will be solved by the epsilon constraint
   method, and the best output will be reported from the Pareto's optimal
   set of answers; Finally the results of the model will be compared in two
   multi-stage and integrated multiobjective modes and the correctness of
   the performance is confirmed.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to solve a multi-period supplier selection and
   inventory lot-sizing problem with multiple products in a serial supply
   chain. Compared to previous models proposed in the literature, our
   research incorporates a richer cost structure involving joint
   replenishment costs for raw material replenishment and production, and a
   more realistic description of the transportation costs represented as a
   vector of full-truck load costs for different size trucks. This problem
   can be displayed graphically as a time-expanded transshipment network
   defined by nodes and arcs that can be reached by feasible material
   flows. First, we propose an integrated mixed integer linear programming
   model that minimizes the cost over the entire supply chain for a given
   planning horizon. The model determines the optimal dynamic supplier
   selection, inventory lot-sizing, and production schedule simultaneously.
   Second, a sequential approach is proposed to solve the same problem.
   That is, a production schedule is determined first, and then a supplier
   selection and replenishment strategy is obtained according to that
   predetermined schedule. Sensitivity analysis comparing the two
   approaches is performed. Results show that, even though the integrated
   approach achieves the minimum cost, the sequential approach may be
   suitable for solving large-scale instances of the problem as it requires
   less information sharing and generates a near-optimal solution with
   shorter implementation time and computational effort.},

Title = {Effect Analysis of Service Supply Chain with Dynamic Game under the
   Condition of Sensitive Demand},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2015},
Abstract = {Under the real circumstances of service supply chain, there is one
   demand appearing as the sensitive feature, to face the increasing
   uncertainty. It could be elaborated upon the decision variables such as
   price, quantity, and efforts. The member behaviors are operated and
   coordinated in the process of multiperiod dynamic game. Based on the
   multiperiod dynamic game theory, the service demand and price, quantity
   of goods, and efforts of members in the secondary service supply chain
   are considered. The paper discusses the reputation effect and ratchet
   effect in the multiperiod dynamic game service supply chain.
   Additionally, the paper describes this problem, builds a programming
   model based on the multiperiod dynamic game, and deduces the optimal
   solution. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the impact of reputation
   effect and ratchet effect on the agent's revenue. Through the
   simulation, it is found that the agency efforts are a combination result
   of reputation effect and ratchet effect in the process of multiperiod
   dynamic game. Through the long-term dynamic game, the short-term moral
   risk in service supply chain can be restrained so that the result under
   the asymmetric information is the same as that under the complete

Abstract = {The manufacturing industry in India started moving towards multi channel
   supply chain for delivering products to the customer by his preferred
   channel of purchasing. But firms are far behind to achieve a goal of
   omnichannel where there exists better interface between various channels
   which increases their customer range and customer comfort. Also, today
   consumer awareness had increased with respect to environmental
   protection while at the other end the government rules and regulations
   also force firms to go with adopting sustainability concepts like green
   and recycling processes in supply chains. This work deals with this
   major issue faced by the firms in India that how to integrate multiples
   channels in designing their supply chain network considering economic
   and environmental sustainability simultaneously. This paper presents a
   mathematical model for an integrated multi channel closed loop supply
   chain network problem, the modeling decisions that include the selection
   of the entity that will fulfill the demands of the omni channel customer
   during different time periods and the supplier selection process
   integrated with the production amounts, inventory levels, stock-outs and
   shipment quantities. The aim of the model is to minimize the total cost
   incurred to the customer, total cost incurred in running the supply
   chain and minimize the total pollution emissions from all the
   transportations of the products between the different stages of the
   supply chain. It is a mixed integer programming problem considered for a
   leading kitchenware company in southern part of India and solved using
   IBM CPLEX optimizer. The result shows that how the dynamics of omni

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {173-211},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to investigate the distinction and
   relationships between the significant strategic capabilities for
   managing risks in supply chains. This intersectional review exposes a
   substantial conceptual contradiction between the perspectives reported
   by various researchers. Further, the current paper classifies the
   literature into four categories according to the broad objectives
   investigated by the research papers.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Initially, a bibliometric analysis aligned with the concepts of a
   systematic literature review is conducted followed by a descriptive
   review focusing on models and methods. The software called BibExcel is
   utilized to extract and analyze the bibliographic information in a
   textual form from the research articles associated with strategic
   capabilities of the logistics sector. The results are exported to the
   software known as Gephi to visualize keyword co-occurrence analysis as
   networks. A well-structured descriptive review is also conducted to
   identify avenues for future research.
   Findings
   Despite conventional supply chain capabilities like efficiency and
   effectiveness, eight significant strategic capabilities of supply chains
   for managing risks are identified from the literature. These
   capabilities with positive connotations include flexibility,
   reliability, resilience, robustness, agility, adaptability, alignment
   and responsiveness. Considering the vast literature on
   flexibility/reliability along with its numerous dimensions and scope,
   the authors found that resilience, robustness, agility, adaptability,
   alignment and effectiveness are achievable through
   flexibility/reliability. Accordingly, it is appropriate to state
   reliability and flexibility as supply chain capabilities to achieve the
   other six supply chain competencies. Furthermore, the entire literature
   in this domain can be classified into four genres according to the
   addressed objectives, namely, concept development/validation, capability
   assessment, network design and performance evaluation.
   Research limitations/implications - The information revealed from the
   keyword co-occurrence analysis along with the research implications
   provided in the penultimate section will assist budding researchers in
   framing novel and promising research objectives. Supply chain
   administrators and policymakers can utilize the literature
   classification and the notable references provided in this review for
   locating potential methods for assessing supply chain strategic
   capabilities, designing the supply chain and evaluating the performance
   of the supply chain.
   Originality/value
   An integrated bibliometric and descriptive literature review procedure
   is utilized in this paper. Furthermore, this critical review is the
   first work on comprehensively mapping the research relationships among
   various strategic capabilities required for mitigating supply chain
   risks.},

Title = {Examining the synergistic effect of supply chain agility, adaptability
   and alignment: a complementarity perspective},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {514-531},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Drawing on complementarity theory, this paper aims to examine the type
   and effect of interdependencies/interaction (i.e. complementarity or
   substitutability) between the supply chain capabilities of agility,
   adaptability and alignment.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A survey research design is adopted to collect primary and secondary
   data from 182 international firms. The complementarity (or
   substitutability) of three As (agile, adaptable and aligned) were
   analyzed in three-way and pairwise interactions; both, correlation and
   performance differences methods of testing the type of interactions
   among the system's elements were used. Supply chain-centric and
   firm-centric performance metrics were used to examine the interaction
   types.
   Findings
   The study did not find empirical evidence of three-way complementarity
   between the three As. However, this paper did find evidence of
   complementarity in bivariate interactions for alignment and
   adaptability. Moreover, in the performance difference method, the study
   found a substitute relationship between all pairs of As.
   Practical implications
   The findings related to the substitutability between the three As offer
   managers guidance on how to allocate their limited resources to avoid
   unnecessary over-or under-investing in either one of the three As.
   Originality/value
   This study helps refine prior findings related to the three As by
   offering evidence that firms can still achieve their performance-related
   goals with reduced investment commitments by taking advantage of the
   substitutability relationship existent between these capabilities. That
   is, instead of concomitantly developing all three As as past studies
   have suggested, managers can use the findings to determine how to
   prioritize their resource allocation better. Furthermore, understanding
   the actual interaction among the supply chain variables generally
   provide insights for designing the supply chain, change management in
   the supply chain, developing supply chain strategy and adopting best
   practices in the supply chain.},

Title = {Robust and stable flexible blood supply chain network design under
   motivational initiatives},
Journal = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To improve the coordination of blood supply and demand, the efficient
   design of the blood supply chain network (BSCN) is a proper strategy. In
   this regard, this paper is the first-ever study to strive for a
   simultaneous investigation on three interdependent challenges of the
   BSCN: (1) donors motivation, (2) optimizing location and capacity
   decisions, and (3) controlling the reliability and robustness of the
   network under combinatorial risk. As in reality, blood donors play a
   critical role in the BSC; this study undertakes motivational initiatives
   to encourage blood donors for maintaining sufficient blood supply.
   Advertisement, education and medical credits are the directions
   incorporated to construct the motivational function. To observe the
   efficiency as the most critical factor while evaluating the pool of
   location alternatives for establishing facilities, an augmented version
   of data envelopment analysis (DEA) is utilized. In addition, a mixed
   integer programming model is proposed by which the simultaneous location
   and capacity decisions are supported. The model is also extended to
   handle the combinatorial risk of uncertainty as well as disruption.
   Thus, a novel mixed possibilistic-stochastic flexible robust programming
   (MPSFRP) is developed. Eventually, the proposed model is implemented in
   a real case study to assess its practicality and then provide applicable
   insights for administrators.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine how multinational companies from
   five industries can adapt to what we call Supply Chain 4.0; the supply
   chain created as a result of the new digital era brought forth by the
   fourth industrial revolution. The focus is limited to three key emerging
   trends this development is seeing; Big Data, cloud computing and 3D
   printing. This study is carried out through a literature review and
   empirical findings from a series of interviews, and an explorative
   survey. The literature review identified a substantial difference in
   compatibility between industry level and the digital transformation
   Supply Chain 4.0 implies. Empirical findings showed that among the
   investigated trends, 3D printing was considered to have a major impact
   on Supply Chain 4.0. Its use though has been limited due to uncertainty
   among the supply chain stakeholders about its true added value in a
   cost/benefit perspective. Moreover, multinationals showed a strong
   preference for Big Data implementations, but only had limited focus on
   cloud computing applications. This paper presents a graphical framework
   meant to give practitioners a better description and understanding of

Title = {Concrete formwork reuse in a supply chain with dynamic changes using
   ABMS and discrete events},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {332},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Concrete formwork is a system supporting and shaping concrete components
   and its potential reuse has been increasingly considered in recent
   years. On-site concrete formwork reuse contributes to cost savings and
   material waste reduction. However, concrete formwork reuse among
   different construction sites is still limited. In addi-tion, on-site
   formwork planning is inherently complicated, and dynamic processes of
   formwork reuse increase the complexity since on-site emergencies result
   in various changes. This study aims to provide an appropriate approach
   to analyze the dynamic processes of formwork reuse among construction
   sites, for minimizing both the total cost of each site and the overall
   formwork consumptions. A mathematical model is first developed to
   analyze formwork utilization on a single site, and an agent-based model
   is then proposed along with discrete events to implement and simulate
   formwork reuse with dynamic changes among construction sites configuring
   a supply chain. The mathematical model minimizing the total cost of
   concrete formwork enables the under-standing of decisions and behaviors
   of a single construction site and provides a basis for simulation
   modeling. In the agent-based model, four major decision agents
   consisting of construction sites, commercial formwork sup-pliers, waste
   disposal centers, and transportation trucks are developed. Considering
   asymmetric information, a negotiation protocol is integrated into
   agents' behaviors to facilitate interactions. With the agent-based
   modeling and simulation, the optimal strategies for construction sites
   to reuse formwork can be generated. The results of a case study indicate
   that formwork reuse in the supply chain can outperform that on a single
   site and results in a cost saving of 25.38\%, a quantity reduction of
   33.56\%, and a surplus reuse value reduction of 73.18\%.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a model of the strategic behavior of firms operating
   in a spatial supply chain network. The manufacturing and retailing firms
   engage in an oligopolistic, noncooperative game by sharing customer
   demand such that a firm's decisions impact the product prices, which in
   turn result in changes in all other firms' decisions. Each firm's payoff
   is to maximize its own profit and we show that, in response to such
   changes in prices and to exogenous environmental taxes, the
   manufacturing firms may strategically alter a variety of choices such as
   `make-buy' decisions with respect to intermediate inputs, spatial
   distribution of production, product shipment patterns and inventory
   management, environmental tax payment vs recycling decisions, and timing
   of all such choices to sustainably manage the profit and the
   environmental regulations. An important implication is that effects of a
   tax depends on the oligopolistic game structure. With respect to
   methods, we show that this dynamic game can be represented as a set of
   differential variational inequalities (DVIs) that motivate a
   computationally efficient nonlinear complementarity (NCP) approach that
   enables the full exploitation of above-mentioned salient features. We
   also provide a numerical example that confirms the utility of our
   proposed framework and shows substantial strategic reaction can be
   expected to a tax on pollution stocks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {IT flexibility is an increasingly important factor in today's dynamic
   business environment. However, earlier research lacks 1) an integrated
   framework that corresponds to diverse processes for supply chain
   management and 2) an explanation of how IT flexibility affects firms'
   performance in the supply chain context. To fill these gaps, our study
   theorised a research model by integrating disparate streams of IT
   flexibility research with three types of IT flexibility, namely,
   operational, transactional, and strategic, and tested both the direct
   and indirect effects of the three IT flexibility types on firm
   performance. Our theoretical model uses an extended resource based view
   to highlight the role of IT flexibility in managing interdependent firm
   relationships in supply chains.
   Using a partial least squares approach to structured equation modelling
   analysis on 162 questionnaires from supply chain practitioners, we found
   two significant relationships: (1) transactional IT flexibility affects
   operational IT flexibility, and (2) operational IT flexibility affects
   strategic IT flexibility. Transactional IT flexibility also affects
   strategic IT flexibility, thus playing a pivotal role in the
   effectiveness of the other two flexibility types. In addition, it was
   identified that transactional and operational flexibilities affect firm
   performance indirectly, via process integration capability, while
   strategic flexibility directly affects firm performance. By classifying
   diverse IT flexibility attributes into three types, a comprehensive and
   explicit concept of IT flexibility in inter-organisational relationships
   is attained, which allows practitioners to target key resource
   investments to realise the full potential of IT in the supply chain.},

Abstract = {A relationship strategy, which engages firms with each other, mainly
   intends to achieve a firm's goals. One goal of such firms is to prolong
   the firm's survival in the market. At the supply networks (SN) level,
   the interactions among firms by means of engaging strategies, i.e.,
   cooperation, defection, competition and co-opetition, are complexly
   interconnected and coevolved. Due to their complexity and dynamic
   nature, investigations of the outcomes of the coevolution of
   interconnected relationship strategies are non-trivial tasks. To
   overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes cellular automata
   simulation frameworks and adopts a complex adaptive supply networks
   perspective to develop a model of the coevolution of interconnected
   relationship strategies in a supply network. We aimed to determine how
   and under what conditions the survivability of firms inside supply
   networks is affected by the coevolution of interconnected relationship
   strategies among them. We constructed experiments using business
   environment scenarios of a SN as its factors and observed how different
   interaction policies of firms could produce networks effects that impact
   the lifespan of firms. We found that a co-operation coupled with a
   co-opetition policy in a business environment that favors co-operation
   can promote the lifespan of nodes at both the individual and SN level.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-54},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes two incentive schemes available for a closed-loop
   supply chain (CLSC) in which a manufacturer and a retailer contribute to
   the return rate dynamics through their investments in green activity
   programs. Both firms have economic motivations to perform the return
   rate because customers who return end-of-use goods also repurchase new
   ones. In addition, the manufacturer exploits the returns' residual value
   in operations to increase profits. Because the manufacturer has both
   operational and marketing motivations to close the loop, he can provide
   an incentive to the retailer to boost her investments in green activity
   programs. The incentive can be either state dependent or control
   dependent. The former assumes that the incentive depends on the fraction
   of customers who are willing to return end-of-use products; the latter
   is proportional to the retailer's green activity programs efforts. Our
   results show that a state-dependent incentive is profit-Pareto-improving
   only when the retailer's environmental effectiveness is large. In
   contrast, a control-dependent incentive mechanism is
   profit-Pareto-improving for low incentive values, high retailer's
   environmental effectiveness, and customers' repurchasing intention. In
   all other cases, players have divergent preferences and neither
   mechanism coordinates the CLSC.},

Abstract = {Composite materials comprising fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) possess
   advantageous properties that surpass that of traditional materials. The
   use of composite materials may give the opportunity to improve the
   technical specifications of a manufactured module and also impact the
   configuration of the supply chain. However, this represents a
   challenging decision-making process as various technologies are
   available for the manufacturing of composite materials. This paper
   proposes a design process based on the identification of the bill of
   materials of a component where the substitution of certain
   sub-assemblies using composite materials may result in the reduction of
   parts, operations and suppliers. The design process is supported by a
   customized software tool that generates a graphic representation of the
   bill of materials of the selected module, allowing users to choose a
   specific sub-assembly, select composite materials process types and
   identify potential suppliers from a database. An industry case involving
   the production of a module used in urban buses/long distance coach
   manufacturing is employed to illustrate the proposed design process. The
   software tool developed satisfactorily integrates the billof-materials
   and current product and process specifications with an existing costing
   engine and a populated database of potential composite materials
   suppliers. The approach presented in the paper can be used to address
   the lack of evaluation tools for using composite materials/carbon fiber.},

Title = {Supply chain disruptions: flexibility measures when encountering

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {567-589},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Purpose There can be many negative effects from a disruption in a
   central node of companies' supply chains, such as a port conflict that
   reduces capacity. Strategies for disruption management include
   flexibility and redundancy. This paper aims to analyse a supply chain
   disruption from flexibility and capacity perspectives.
   Design/methodology/approach A case study was conducted of the supply
   chain disruption caused by the port conflict in 2016-2017 in Gothenburg,
   in which the port operated at a reduced capacity. Companies importing
   and exporting goods, freight forwarders, hauliers, train operators,
   ports, shipping companies and their agents were interviewed. Findings
   Various capacity problems (ports, links, container chassis, empty
   containers) were encountered due to the port conflict. Flexibility
   measures such as node, mode and fleet flexibility can be used in
   response to changes in capacity. Difficulties with applying flexibility
   are discussed. Research limitations/implications Although based on a
   Swedish case, findings are relevant for disruptions or other types of
   disturbances in ports elsewhere and also in other important nodes in
   companies' supply chains. Practical implications Actors influenced by
   disturbances in a port can increase their understanding of potential
   capacity problems and flexibility measures. Readiness and timely action
   are important due to competition regarding capacity. Originality/value
   The implications on the transport network surrounding a port, including
   many actors, are explained, illustrating how capacity problems
   propagate, but there is some flexibility to manage the problems.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS \& CONTROL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {83},
Pages = {232-269},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {World markets are highly interlinked and local economies extensively
   rely on global supply and value chains. Consequently, local production
   disruptions, for instance caused by extreme weather events, are likely
   to induce indirect losses along supply chains with potentially global
   repercussions. These complex loss dynamics represent a challenge for
   comprehensive disaster risk assessments. Here, we introduce the
   numerical agent-based model acclimate designed to analyze the cascading
   of economic losses in the global supply network. Using national sectors
   as agents, we apply the model to study the global propagation of losses
   induced by stylized disasters. We find that indirect losses can become
   comparable in size to direct ones, but can be efficiently mitigated by
   warehousing and idle capacities. Consequently, a comprehensive risk
   assessment cannot focus solely on first-tier suppliers, but has to take
   the whole supply chain into account. To render the supply network
   climate-proof, national adaptation policies have to be complemented by
   international adaptation efforts. In that regard, our model can be
   employed to assess reasonable leverage points and to identify dynamic
   bottlenecks inaccessible to static analyses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Governments formulate different subsidy policies to incentivize
   manufacturers to produce green products, and these policies may have
   different subsidy effects. The purpose of this study is to compare and
   analyze the dynamic effects of different subsidy policies to the
   manufacturer in a green supply chain composed of a manufacturer and a
   retailer. Three differential game models, considering the consumers
   preference, are established under three subsidy policies, and the
   corresponding optimal equilibrium strategies of the supply chain members
   are analyzed. An example is used to compare the effects of the three
   policies under the equal government subsidy expenditure. The study finds
   that the rankings of indexes to evaluate steady-state subsidy effects
   under the different subsidy policies are time invariant, and the
   government can preliminarily evaluate these policies according to
   different subsidy goals. The rankings of indexes to evaluate phased
   subsidy effects under these policies are time varying. If both subsidy
   effects and subsidy efficiencies in steady state are taken into account,
   the optimal selection paths of subsidy policies in the whole period can
   be obtained. The subsidy effects of the same policy are amplified under
   the condition of equal steady-state subsidy expenditure, but the
   rankings of effect indexes under the different subsidy policies are not
   affected.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a two-echelon, two-product Supply Chain
   (SC) inspired by a real-world production/distribution firm, in which the
   product change-over time, necessary to switch from a product to another,
   induces a variable capacity in the factory. Such a varying production
   capacity is further exacerbated by the machine breakdowns that may occur
   in the manufacturing system. Since the two products share the same
   production system, a production planning rule has to be executed to
   decide the change-over, i.e. to select the product to be manufactured
   over time. An extended experimental campaign has been performed to
   investigate how the fill rate and the standard deviation of inventories
   vary as a series of operational and tactical parameters changes. Several
   ANOVA analyses revealed a strong interaction between the production
   planning model and the adopted smoothing replenishment strategy, which
   remarkably affects the performance of the SC. Interestingly, a higher
   value of the proportional controller negatively affects the service
   levels since the adopted production planning policy, under these
   circumstances, tends to encourage longer production runs for a certain
   product and, consequently, persistent stock outs for the other one.},

Abstract = {People from all walks of life sharing all types of thoughts exchange one
   collective challenge, which is starvation', and it needs food' for
   existence. Fertilizers shall carry on playing an important part in
   meeting this everlasting challenge.' Needless to say that green supply
   chain management has countless significance in the fertilizer sector'.
   There are incredible monetary and ecological opportunities for
   development in the supply chains of fertilizer plants. Manufacturing of
   fertilizers caused some pollution, which manifests all through its
   supply chain in the form of losses. The additional need of fertilizers
   in agricultural sector must primarily ensure food safety and
   environmental protection. Through this research paper, an effort has
   been made to express a model of twelve governing drivers which play an
   important role in the execution of green supply chain management for the
   fertilizer plant in Punjab, India. The methodology used in the analysis
   of drivers was Interpretive Structural Modeling,' and Matriced Impacts
   Croises Multiplication Applique and Classment analysis' was applied for
   improved understanding of all these drivers. The analysis proved that
   Government Regulatory System was a key driver for the implementation of
   green supply chain management practices. It would further help the
   management to focus on the main drivers in the execution of such
   environment friendly practices.},

Title = {Pareto-efficient coordination of the contract-based MTO supply chain
   under flexible cap-and-trade emission constraint},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {250},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Low-carbon production is key to both economic and environmental
   sustainability. It is, however, inadequate to meet the low-carbon
   targets by the manufacturing industry alone. Current research on
   emission reduction targets mainly at individual optimality, with little
   consideration of the synergistic benefits achievable through
   coordination among supply chain players. This paper fills this gap by
   incorporating Pareto improvement to ensure that all members are likely
   to gain in emission reduction through coordination. It gives the
   emission-dependent manufacturers theoretical basis and managerial
   insights to go through the stringent emission-limited market, especially
   under a new proposed low-carbon policy of flexible cap-and-trade, which
   will soon be deployed for emissions trading in China. This flexible
   cap-and-trade policy aligns emission reduction with capacity
   adjustments, but its impact has rarely been investigated. Considering
   the complexity of the supply chain structure, this paper simplifies the
   problem to two stages: manufacturer and retailer. While the demand
   uncertainty is considered with Newsvendor models, Stackelberg game is
   exploited to solve this problem with three contracts, namely revenue
   sharing, cost sharing, and two-part tariff. Analytical and numerical
   studies show that the profitability and greenness of the supply chain
   are increased by coordination with revenue sharing and two-part tariff
   contracts. The Pareto improvement encourages cooperation between the
   supply chain members. Managerial insights are given to help
   emission-dependent manufacturers compete in the increasingly stringent
   low-carbon environment. The novelty of this paper lies in the
   investigation of synergistic benefits achievable through coordination
   under the new flexible cap-and-trade emission policy, and the
   Pareto-improving conditions with several contracts are analyzed by
   Newsvendor models. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Identifying and analysis of key flexible sustainable supply chain
   management strategies toward overcoming the post-COVID-19 impacts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS},
Abstract = {Purpose The emerging markets are facing a lot of risks and disruptions
   across their supply chains (SCs) due to the deadly coronavirus disease
   2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To mitigate the significant post-COVID-19
   consequences, organizations should modify their existing strategies and
   focus more on the key flexible sustainable SC (SSC) strategies. Still
   now, a limited number of studies have highlighted about the flexible
   strategies what firms should adopt to reduce the rampant effects in the
   context of emerging markets. Design/methodology/approach This study
   presents an integrated approach including Delphi method, Bayesian, and
   the Best-Worst-Method (BWM) to identify, assess and evaluate the
   importance of the key flexible SSC strategies for the footwear industry
   in the emerging market context. Findings The results found the
   manufacturing flexibility through automation integration as the most
   important flexible SSC strategy to improve the flexibility and
   sustainability of modern SCs. Also, developing omni-channel distribution
   and retailing strategies and increasing the level of preparedness by
   using artificial intelligent are crucial strategies for overcoming the
   post-COVID-19 impacts. Originality/value The novelty of this research is
   that the research connects a link among flexible strategies, SCs
   sustainability, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the
   research proposes a novel and intelligent framework based on Delphi and
   Bayesian-BWM to identify and analyze the key flexible SSC strategies to
   build up sustainable and robust SCs which can withstand in the

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Due to the consistent growth of energy consumption and its impacts on
   production costs and the environment, governments have recently begun to
   devise and implement various energy-saving (ES) strategies. This paper
   studies the optimal pricing decisions in a dual-channel supply chain
   (SC) -consists of a manufacturer and a retailer- under different
   government intervention policies, namely ES, revenue seeking, social
   welfare, and sustainable development. We develop an extended
   dual-channel SC model under flexible return policies, including
   full-refund via the direct (i.e., manufacturer) channel, the indirect
   (i.e., retailer) channel, and both direct and indirect channels. A
   dynamic multi-level Stackelberg game approach is used to examine the SC
   interactions and characterize the return strategy, optimal pricing, and
   ES level decisions under different scenarios. The results show that
   employing full-refund via the indirect channel policy under price
   incentive schemes not only maximizes the profit of dual-channel SC but
   also satisfies the government's objective functions. In contrast to
   other intervention policies, the revenue seeking policy does not
   necessarily improve the social welfare and energy saving level unless
   the government budget is increased.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to develop a construction supply chain-based

   considered. Another objective is to control the delayed quantity during
   the supply process. Further, the viability and operational integrity is
   ensured by the establishment of a real resources limitation. Then, a new
   hybrid simulated annealing particle swarm optimisation algorithm is
   applied to solve the model. Finally, a practical application case in
   China was studied to examine the efficiency of the proposed model. By

Title = {Integrating Customer Order Decoupling Point with Operation Planning in
   Deteriorating Supply Chain: General Dynamic Model and Applications},
Journal = {ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Considering the real dilemma of deteriorating items, we explore how to
   find a balance between the conflicting achievements of enhancing
   flexibility and reducing costs. We propose a general dynamic model to
   penetrate customer orders by decoupling point with objective to minimize
   the cost. The closed forms of optimal solutions are obtained for
   companies to deal with the integrated problem of customer order
   decoupling point (CODP) decision and production-inventory plan
   simultaneously. Applications and numerical experiments are performed to
   illustrate practical insights for managers. The results show that the
   truth of zero-inventory policy is to avoid unnecessary inventory instead
   of absolutely no inventory. The CODP will shift forward with the
   increasing of customer demand rate and shift backward with the
   increasing of deterioration rate under the production smoothing policy.
   However, although it encounters the same changes of demand, the CODP
   moves with a smaller extent in high deterioration rate than in low. In
   addition, we find that during the growth phase of product life cycle,
   the increase of time-sensitive degree of demand is coupled with forward
   shifting of CODP; while during the decline phase, it is coupled with
   CODP backward shifting.},

Abstract = {In order to stay responsive to evolving customer demands and to meet the

   are recognizing the need to quickly reconfigure their manufacturing

   manufacturing tasks, outsourcing decisions, supply chain configurations,

   optimize the configuration of manufacturing supply chain networks to
   support reconfiguration decision-making. An optimization model is
   formulated to minimize the total cost of the manufacturing enterprise
   with the consideration of operating cost and reconfiguration cost. To
   effectively quantify the reconfiguration cost, a graph-based cost model
   is developed to characterize the relationship between the graphical
   similarity of two supply chain networks and the reconfiguration cost.
   Outsourcing decisions and supply chain risks are also considered in the
   proposed model. A case study on a supply chain for laptop computer

Abstract = {Responsiveness to customers and markets is an indispensable requirement
   for all industries, particularly the fashion industry. The present study
   attempts to address this issue by employing a resource-based perspective
   as a lens for exploring the major antecedents and consequences of supply
   chain agility at both the strategic and operational levels. Drawing on a
   review of the extant literature, we argue that two organizational
   flexibility factors - strategic flexibility and manufacturing
   flexibility - are the critical antecedents to supply chain agility. In
   addition, supply chain agility, strategic flexibility, and manufacturing
   flexibility are all significant factors in firm performance. A
   conceptual framework for the arguments was developed and tested through
   an empirical study of selected industrial practitioners. Data from a
   sample of 141 garment manufacturers were analyzed using structural
   equation modeling. The results reveal that both strategic flexibility
   and manufacturing flexibility positively influence supply chain agility.
   However, strategic flexibility has a direct and significant influence on
   firm performance while manufacturing flexibility does not. Furthermore,
   supply chain agility plays an important role in mediating the effects of
   both strategic and manufacturing flexibilities on firm performance. The
   findings of the present study add to the understanding of supply chain
   management, with a focus on supply chain agility in the fashion
   manufacturing industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, an Internal Model Control (IMC) scheme is incorporated in
   production inventory control systems in a complete supply chain. This
   control scheme presents a good target inventory tracking under the
   perfect knowledge of the system. Furthermore, the inventory tracking and
   load disturbance rejection control problems can be tackled separately.
   However, the closed-loop performance of the IMC scheme may be degraded
   due to a mismatch between the modelled and actual delay or to the fact
   that delays may be time-varying. Thus, the IMC control scheme is
   enhanced in this work with a novel method for the online identification

   the IMC scheme can be exploited. A detailed discussion of the proposed

Title = {Understanding influence of supply chain competencies when developing
   Triple-A},
Journal = {BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Abstract = {Purpose To be successful in the rapidly changing global business
   environment, supply chains (SCs) must be agile, adaptable and aligned
   (Lee, 2004), a practice known as Triple-A. Therefore, the purpose of
   this paper is to investigate the dimensions of Triple-A SCs and their
   concurrent impact on all three Triple-A components.
   Design/methodology/approach The relationship among these factors is
   analyzed through Smart PLS-structured equation modeling (PLS-SEM) for
   which data have been collected from 243 SC professionals working in
   manufacturing organizations. Findings The findings of this study reveal
   that the relationship between visibility and adaptability are directly
   significant but that the negative relationship between velocity and
   alignment is insignificant; however, indirectly these relationships have
   a positive impact using the mediating effect of agility over visibility
   and adaptability, velocity and alignment. However, the relationship of
   flexibility over SC Triple-A is positively significant, visibility over
   agility and alignment is positively significant and velocity over
   agility and adaptability is also positively significant, and each impact
   agility over adaptability and adaptability over alignment which is
   significant. Originality/value There is a shortage of empirical studies
   to date that empirically provide evidence of possible relationships
   among Triple-A and its key dimensions when attempting to obtain
   Triple-A. This is the first authenticated Triple-A SC conceptual
   framework that provides direction to better understand the dimension and
   significance of Triple-A.},

Abstract = {Emerging research within the field of personalised medicines has aimed
   to enhance patient treatment through the use of pharmaceutical products
   that are customised to the individual needs and preferences of the
   patient. The currently dominant production platforms of pharmaceutical
   products, however, regard a mass production paradigm and are thus
   unfeasible for the production and provision of personalised medicines.
   The production platforms are not designed or are intended for a
   customisation context. Operating such a context with the current supply
   chain entails challenges such as increasing costs, time to patient and
   efforts in quality assurance activities. To address these challenges,
   this paper presents four reconfigured pharmaceutical supply chain
   designs. A qualitative operational performance assessment elicits the
   strengths and weaknesses of the respective supply chain design operating
   in a customisation context. The results suggest that a later point of
   variegation, that is, the point in the supply chain where the final
   customisation is achieved, can relieve the operational effort of the
   stakeholders in the supply chain while providing the benefits of
   personalised medicines, that is, an enhanced treatment outcome of the
   patient. A trade-off remains, however, between the supply chain's
   decreased operational effort and degree of necessary reconfigurations,
   such as introducing new functions to stakeholder operation, reallocating
   activities to other stakeholders or educating stakeholders.},

Title = {Reconfiguration of food grain supply network amidst COVID-19 outbreak:
   an emerging economy perspective},
Journal = {ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Abstract = {The procurement of food grains from farmers is one of the biggest
   challenges under the COVID-19 outbreak due to country-wise lockdowns.
   The present study aims to reconfigure the existing food grain supply
   chain network. The study advances the extant literature by proposing a
   novel mathematical model that considers the government guidelines issued
   to procure food grains from farmers under the COVID-19 situation. The
   model includes personal distancing, a key parameter relevant in the
   COVID-19 crisis, and has remained unaddressed in the existing
   literature. The proposed model is tested in India. The effect of
   different parameters like personal distancing cost, carbon emission
   cost, fixed cost, and transportation cost is also investigated under a
   given set of procurement centers. Finally, the procurement schedule for
   each procurement center is generated, which is especially useful for
   managing its activities and is also helpful to farmers to streamline the
   process. Results indicate that the proposed model is highly effective
   under pandemic emergencies like the current COVID-19 crisis.
   Policymakers and the government will find this model helpful in drafting
   relevant policies regarding food grain procurement under emergencies
   such as the COVID-19 outbreak. The distribution segment of the supply
   chain network is not part of the present research work. In future
   studies, this part could be then added to the whole of the procurement
   process, and both procurement and distribution can be assessed together
   again.},

Abstract = {Supply chain (SC) resilience and flexibility are important research
   topics receiving growing attention. However, the academic literature
   needs empirical studies on SC resilience capable of investigating the
   inter-organizational components of flexibility along different tiers.
   Therefore, this paper analyzes the main lack of flexibilities in three
   Brazilian automotive SCs that limit their resilience and therefore their
   capacity to better support and meet the demand changes in the
   marketplace. A multi-tier case study approach is adopted. Research
   findings identify lack of flexibilities in different tiers that inhibit
   the SC resilience as well as manufacturing and SC flexibilities that
   build SC resilience. The findings also highlight that the same SC may
   have the flexibility to be resilient for one of its products but not for
   another product, what sheds new lights on the academic literature.
   Finally, flexible SCs should be designed to increase SC resilience to
   cope with mishaps as significant demand changes.},

Title = {Sustainable, resilient and responsive mixed supply chain network design
   under hybrid uncertainty with considering COVID-19 pandemic disruption},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Pages = {278-300},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic is a disruption that has
   adversely affected many supply chains (SCs) around the world and further
   proved the necessity of combination and interaction of resilience and
   sustainability. In This paper, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear
   programming model is developed for responsive, resilient and sustainable
   mixed open and closed-loop supply chain network design (SCND) problem.
   The uncertainty of the problem is handled with a hybrid
   robust-stochastic optimization approach. A Lagrangian relaxation (LR)
   method and a constructive heuristic (CH) algorithm are developed for
   overcoming problem complexity and solving large-scale instances. In
   order to assess the performance of the mathematical model and solution
   methods, some test instances are generated. The computations showed that
   the model and the solution methods are efficient and can obtain
   high-quality solutions in suitable CPU times. Other analyses and
   computations are done based on a real case study in the tire industry.
   The results demonstrate that resilient strategies are so effective and
   can improve economic, environmental and social dimensions substantially.
   Research findings suggest that the proposed model can be used as an
   efficient tool for designing sustainable and resilient SCs and the
   related decision-makings. Also, our findings prove that resilience is
   necessary for continued SC sustainability. It is concluded that using
   proposed resilience strategies simultaneously brings the best outcome
   for SC objectives. Based on the sensitivity analyses, the responsiveness
   level significantly affects SC objectives, and managers should consider
   the trade-off between responsiveness and their objectives.(c) 2021

Abstract = {Research suggests that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in
   India are hesitant to adopt the leading management practices. This
   exacerbates their competitive disadvantage against larger firms in a
   highly competitive and rapidly evolving marketplace. Indian SMEs'
   reluctance to embrace advanced management practices may be explained by
   their satisficing business behaviors. In other words, Indian SMEs are
   highly likely to continue with business as usual - a customary of
   deficient modus of operandi, and refuse to search for optimal solutions
   and practices. We argue that overcoming satisficing biases may require
   Indian SMEs to strive for strategic flexibility that allow for prompt
   adjustments in value creation activities. A higher strategic flexibility
   allows SMEs in the manufacturing sector to rapidly adjust product range,
   variety, innovativeness, and speed of development to capitalize on new
   opportunities and minimize the negative impact of changing market
   condi-tions. This may allow SMEs to overcome competitive disadvantages
   and compete effectively against larger firms in the market. We argue
   that SMEs seeking to obtain strategic flexibility must focus on
   information quality and supply chain integration. We assess the proposed
   model using a sample of 100 top SME managers operating in India.},

Abstract = {The miniaturization and modularization of production capacity brings
   with it not only greater agility and efficiency, but also increased
   flexibility in the form of mobility. This flexibility allows production
   capacity to be moved when and where it is most needed, generating new
   business opportunities, e.g., allowing modular units to be rented,

   control systems that ensure a correct and secure flow of information
   between different stakeholders of the supply chain. Based on this, the
   present article characterizes the concept of software-defined mobile
   supply chains, presenting its main requirements, opportunities, and
   limitations. In addition, we present two case studies in which the
   proposed concept is evaluated in order to demonstrate its applicability.
   Here, due to the new optimization problems that arise when considering
   mobile facilities, special interest is given to the planning and control
   of the required operations, as well as the difficulties associated with

   Design/methodology/approach - The research takes semi-structured,
   indepth interviews with ten operations and supply chain practitioners in
   the Australian manufacturing sector. A systematic qualitative data
   analysis approach grounded on cross-interview synthesis was used.
   Findings - Findings contributed into understanding of the manufacturing
   companies' implementation of relationship integration with respect to
   decision trade-offs involved in contract design. Moreover, the findings
   revealed the significant perceived importance and impact of relationship
   integration on supply chain agility and flexibility development. This
   was, however, found to be a function of things such as upstream or

   in terms of seven propositions.
   Practical implications - Analysis of the interviews substantiates the
   criticality of informed allocation of resources to
   relationship-intensive activities and investments across the supply
   chain to develop agility and flexibility. International businesses can
   gain insights into Australian manufacturing businesses' perception of
   relationship integration, which can be invaluable for strategic planning

   general multiple breakpoint function, to persuade producers to reduce
   backorders as much as possible; (vi) some indicators of a green supply
   chain, such as greenhouse gas emissions and waste management are also
   incorporated into the model. The proposed model is first a nonlinear
   mixed integer programming which is converted into a linear one by
   applying some theoretical and numerical techniques. Due to the convexity
   of the model, the local solution obtained from linear programming
   solvers is also the global solution. Finally, a numerical example is
   presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model. (c) 2013

Title = {An analysis of OWL-based semantic mediation approaches to enhance
   manufacturing service capability models},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},
Number = {9},
Pages = {803-823},
Abstract = {The exchange of accurate, computer-interpretable information is critical
   in today's dynamic supply chains in which manufacturers come and go as
   needed. This exchange begins when manufacturers, who hope to join the
   supply chain, provide the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) with
   information regarding their production capabilities. These capabilities
   are represented electronically in what are called manufacturing service
   capability (MSC) models. These models are frequently proprietary, which
   makes them difficult to access, and imprecise, which makes them
   difficult to use. Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a powerful language for
   capturing the semantics of such models. OWL can enhance both precision
   and accessibility, but it requires semantic mediation to resolve
   semantic conflicts and more importantly to enhance model semantics.
   Semantic-mediation approaches can generally be classified into two
   approaches mapping-based and reference-ontology-based. This paper
   characterises and compares the two approaches. Characterisation is based
   on examples of proprietary MSC models and by deployment criteria
   including mediation quality, scalability, evolution, and knowledge
   organisation. Comparison is based on the behaviours and trade-offs of
   the two approaches in the context of these deployment criteria. The
   paper also provides a decision-making template associated with these
   criteria. Finally, the paper uses this template to show under what
   conditions each mediation technique is preferred.},

Title = {Understanding the Generation of Value along Supply Chains: Balancing
   Control Information and Relational Governance Mechanisms in Downstream
   and Upstream Relationships},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Firms are involved in supply chains to achieve operative efficiency,
   develop strategic advantages, and generate financial profits. However,
   there is limited evidence regarding how governance mechanisms influence
   the generation of value from collaboration. Furthermore, how a
   particular buyer or supplier position provides benefits to partners is
   unclear. In this paper, we examine the roles of management control
   information as both a governance mechanism and a source of dynamic
   capabilities, and its interaction with relational variables to create
   and capture value following a demand-side perspective. Two separate
   studies are developed using multigroup structural equation modelling,
   which analyse buyer and supplier positions played by the firm as a
   complex supply chain node. The results demonstrate that the
   characteristics of information sharing have different impacts on value,
   depending on the role played in the relationship. Although timely
   information sharing appears to be the key source of operative and
   financial value in downstream relationships, disaggregated information
   sharing generates additional strategic advantages in upstream
   relationships. The presence of different control-trust frameworks
   mediates the process of value generation, leading to different
   managerial and theoretical implications.},

Abstract = {Information and communication technologies (ICT) are widely used in

   the six hypotheses established in the model. Such hypotheses were
   validated with a 95 \% confidence level, and values were standardized to
   avoid problems regarding the measurement scale. Findings demonstrate
   that ICT have a positive direct impact on the other three analysed
   latent variables, which together account for 63 \% of the variability of
   SC economic performance. Similarly, we found that ICT can explain up to
   40 \% of the variability of SC agility. (C) 2017 PEI, University of

Abstract = {Supplier evaluation is of great significance in green supply chain

Abstract = {5G technology enables end-to-end connectivity in real time at a highly
   granular level along with the associated end-to-end visibility through
   the Internet-of-Everything. While some potential benefits of 5G for
   digital supply chain and operations management have been declared,
   literature is still silent about theoretical underpinning and structured
   conceptualisation of application areas, underlying implementation
   challenges, and the role of 5G in future transformations of value
   creation. This paper aims to offer some directions of how to close this
   research gap. We organise the discussion around five major capabilities
   of the digital supply chain and smart operations which can be enhanced
   by 5G, i.e. intelligence, visibility, transparency, dynamic networking,
   and connectivity. We delineate possible future research topics related
   to 5G in different areas of Industry 4.0-driven, digital supply chain
   and operations management which can be useful for researchers and
   practitioners alike when seeking to understand the impact of 5G on both
   short-term and long-term time scales. Our analysis encompasses both
   operational processes (e.g. transformations of manufacturing and
   warehouse operations by end-to-end connectivity of devices) and
   strategic perspectives (e.g. transformations of business models and
   supply network structures through end-to-end real-time visibility and
   connectivity of industry, public infrastructure, and consumers).

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND HEALTHCARE MARKETING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {325-347},
Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to focus on the impact of supply chain (SC)
   integration, demand forecasting and supplier performance on patient
   responsiveness at public hospitals through the mediating role of SC
   flexibility.
   Design/methodology/approach To measure the above stated correlation, a
   Likert scale with five points and 23 items was used and structural
   equation modeling was applied. The scale was applied to public
   hospitals. Statistical software programs (SPSS 18 and LISREL 8.8) were
   used to analyze the data. The analysis of reported statistics is based
   on a sample of 129 logistics and SC specialists at public hospitals in
   the cities representing different regions of Turkey.
   Findings The research hypotheses are supported as a result of the
   analysis. The research reveals that SC flexibility has a mediation
   effect between SC integration, demand forecasting, supplier performance
   and patient responsiveness.
   Practical implications The increasing number of population, geopolitical
   position, migration waves, man-made and natural disasters lead Turkish
   health-care industry to have effective SC plans to satisfy the patients'
   needs successfully and reduce the effects of these fatal events. In this
   sense, SC flexibility is an important factor for health-care industry in
   responding changing patient demands. At this juncture, the main point is
   to bring required resources together in the right place and at the right
   time. Otherwise, health-care institutions cannot serve the affected
   people because of the non-availability of supply. To achieve it, public
   health-care institutions should give more importance to the SC
   principles.
   Originality/value Success in SC flexibility in health care can directly
   affect patient welfare. Thus, focusing on the patient responsiveness is
   an important aim of the health-care industry. However, it was determined
   that less attention has been given to understanding patient satisfaction
   as a result of SC operations. The results indicate that patient
   responsiveness improvement should be included into strategic plans, and
   SC efforts should be used as a means of satisfying patient needs
   quickly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
   investigating the mentioned relationships at public hospitals. Findings
   of this paper will have a significant contribution for researchers and
   health-care professionals in understanding the impact of SC to patient
   responsiveness.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce cloud supply chain which is a business model
   based on cloud-enabled networking of some third-party physical and
   digital assets to design and manage a supply chain network. Cloud supply
   chain integrates concepts and technology of Industry 4.0 and digital
   platforms emerging in the ``supply chain-as-a-service{''} paradigm. This
   paper conceptualizes the cloud supply chain as a new and distinct
   research area. Through analysis of practical cases, we deduce some
   generalized characteristics of the cloud supply chain. In the
   generalised model, we formalize supply chain multi-structural dynamics
   and dynamic service composition. Our results show that the main
   generalized characteristics of the cloud supply chain are related to (i)
   multistructural dynamics; (ii) platforms, digital supply chains,
   ecosystems, and visibility, (iii) dynamic service composition with
   dynamically changing buyer/supplier roles, (iv) resilience and
   viability, and (v) intertwined supply networks and circular economy. We
   close by discussing future research directions including novel context

Title = {Truthful Cheap Talk: Why Operational Flexibility May Lead to Truthful
   Communication},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {65},

Pages = {1624-1641},

Abstract = {This paper shows that operational flexibility interacting with
   informational uncertainty may lead to truthful information exchange in
   equilibrium even when the communication is nonbinding and unverifiable,
   i.e., ``cheap talk.{''} We consider a model consisting of a manufacturer
   releasing a new product with uncertain release date and demand, and a
   retailer who must determine the allocation of limited capacity between a
   preexisting third-party product and the manufacturer's new product that
   may or may not be released on time. The manufacturer has a private
   forecast about the likelihood of the product release and/or about the
   demand, which he shares (either truthfully or not) with the retailer. We
   show that under the ``traditional{''} supply chain structure (one-time
   opportunity to order) no truthful equilibrium can emerge. However, if
   (1) the supply chain structure allows for postponement, i.e., the
   ability to delay orders at a certain cost by the retailer, and (2) the
   manufacturer has informational uncertainty about the retailer's
   capacity, then truthful information exchange may emerge in equilibrium,
   where the manufacturer transmits his true forecast and the retailer
   treats the transmission as truthful. The genesis of this effect is
   preference reversal, where the manufacturer is not sure which way to
   distort the forecast to best motivate the retailer to wait for the new
   product. Thus, we show that a truth-revealing mechanism can emerge from
   a relatively rich setup featuring two-sided information asymmetry
   interacting with postponement.},

Title = {Pressures affecting green supply chain performance},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT DECISION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {51},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1753-1768},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to empirically investigate the relationship
   between the directions of pressures affecting green supply chain
   management (GSCM) and supply chain (SC) performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - This re,search is based on a survey
   because there is no archival database providing detailed information on
   GSC practices and performance. A survey questionnaire was developed to
   collect research data, based on the GSC literature and a pilot study in
   the field. The authors developed hypotheses based on two theories:
   institutional theory and the resource-based view (RBV). Confirmatory
   factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used
   to test the hypotheses with SPSS (16.0) and AMOS (5.0).
   Findings - The results confirmed the importance of implementing
   environmental SC practices to sustain organizations' competitive
   advantage and performance. Increased SC flexibility helped reduce
   resources, through decreased cost factors and improved output.
   Enterprises with environmental SC policies tended to increase SC
   flexibility and, hence, enhanced profits.
   Originality/value - This paper applies organizational theories to GSCM
   by extending the institutional-versus-internal-pressure construct to the
   way enterprises implement GSC strategies for sustainable SC.},

Title = {Reconciling integration and reconfiguration management approaches in the
   supply chain},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {242},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Supply chain integration (SCI) and reconfiguration (SCR) are two primary
   approaches in recent supply chain management. However, their conflicting
   mechanisms and axioms have engendered two branches of research. This
   study, based on the concept of ambidexterity, argues that pursuing SCI
   and SCR simultaneously as the ambidextrous management of supply chain
   (AMSC) is key to manufacturers to gain superior performance. Based on
   the dynamic capabilities view (DCV), this paper identities data analysis
   capability and organizational mindfulness as important drivers of the
   AMSC. Based on 333 samples of Taiwanese manufacturing firms, our
   findings demonstrate that the AMSC has a positive effect on the
   manufacturer performance. Data analysis capability and organizational
   mindfulness can support a manufacturing firm to sense environment and to
   facilitate the AMSC. Although research on SCI and SCR has advanced over
   the past years, less studies reconcile such two contradicting
   approaches. By considering SCI and SCR depth in terms of their
   mechanisms and axioms, this study clarifies the relationship between SCI
   and SCR and shows their effects on the manufacturer performance.
   Furthermore, this study extends the DCV by showing that data analysis
   capability and organizational mindfulness are key to foster dynamic
   capabilities.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a novel multi-objective model for dynamic and integrated
   network design of sustainable closed-loop supply chain network is
   proposed, which aims to optimize economic, environmental, and social
   concerns, simultaneously. In order to have a dynamic design, multiple
   strategic periods are considered during the planning horizon.
   Furthermore, different short-term decisions are integrated with
   long-term decisions related to the network design problem. Two of these
   short-term decisions determine selling price of products in forward
   logistics and buying price of used products from customer zones in
   reverse logistics. Due to the complexity of the proposed multi-objective
   model, a Multi-Objective Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (MOICA) is
   proposed to solve the model, and the results are compared with a
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Finally, to evaluate
   the performance of proposed algorithm, several numerical examples are
   used of which the results indicate the efficiency of the proposed
   algorithm. (C) 2018 Sharif University of Technology. All rights

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the closed-loop supply chain network
   design problem considering the environmental and responsiveness
   features. For this purpose, a multi-objective mathematical model is
   suggested that minimizes the carbon emissions and the total costs and
   maximizes the responsiveness of the system. Due to the dynamic space of
   the business environment, uncertainty is an integral part of the supply
   chain problem. Therefore, this research applies the robust possibilistic
   programming method to cope with uncertainty. Afterwards, since the
   research problem has a high level of the complexity, a hybrid solution
   approach based on a heuristic method and the meta-goal programming
   method is developed to solve the research problem in a reasonable time.
   Then, due to the importance of the ventilator device during the recent
   pandemic (COVID-19), this study considers this product as a case study.
   The main contribution of the current study is to design a
   green-responsive closed-loop supply chain network under uncertainty
   using a multi-objective robust possibilistic programming model, for the
   first time in the literature, especially in the medical devices
   industry. On the other side, the other contribution of this study is to
   develop an efficient hybrid solution method. The achieved results
   demonstrate the efficiency of the offered model and the developed hybrid
   method. Eventually, by carrying out sensitivity analysis, the impact of
   some of the critical parameters on the model is investigated. Based on
   the obtained results, an increase in the demand sizes leads to
   increasing the environmental damages and the total costs while reducing
   the responsiveness level. On the other side, an increase in the rate of
   return leads to an increase in all of the objective functions. Also, the
   achieved results show that when the capacity parameter is increased, the
   total costs are decreased, but the responsiveness and environmental
   impacts are increased.},

Title = {Exploring data-driven innovation: What's missing in the relationship
   between big data analytics capabilities and supply chain innovation?},
Journal = {ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Abstract = {Data-driven innovations (DDI) have significantly impacted firms'
   operations thanks to the massive exploitation of huge data. However, to
   leverage big data and achieve supply chain innovation, a variety of
   complementary resources are necessary. In this study, we hypothesise
   that supply chain innovation (SCI) is dependent on firms' big data
   analytics capabilities (BAC). Furthermore, we propose that this relation
   is mediated by two crucial capabilities of agility and adaptability that
   enable firms to efficiently meet the challenges of supply chain
   ambidexterity. Finally, we also test the moderating role of technology
   uncertainty in our research model. We collected data from 386
   manufacturing firms in Pakistan and tested our model using structural
   equation modelling. The results confirmed our initial hypotheses that
   agility and adaptability both mediated our baseline relationship of BAC
   and big data innovation in supply chains. We further found support for
   the moderating role of technology uncertainty. Furthermore, technology
   uncertainty moderates the relationship between BAC and SCI. This study
   extends the current literature on digital analytics capabilities and
   innovation along the supply chain. Practically, our research suggests
   that investment in big data can result in affirmative consequences, if
   firms cultivate capabilities to encounter supply chain ambidexterity
   through agility and adaptability. Accordingly, we suggest that managers
   belonging to manufacturing firms need to build up these internal
   capabilities and to monitor and assess technology uncertainty in the
   environment.},

Abstract = {Due to high energy-intensive processes and a dependence on carbon-based

   transformable production systems are currently in the focus of research
   addressing the required flexibility. These systems which consist of
   modular production and logistics units offer the possibility to adapt
   flexibly in volatile conditions within dynamic supply chains. Hence,
   this work compiles elements for environmental sustainability, which
   minimize the carbon footprint in the process industry: transformable
   production systems, the utilization of bio-based resources, carbon
   dioxide and renewable energy as well as the application of these
   elements in decentral production networks. Finally, possible use cases

Title = {Modelling supply chain viability during COVID-19 disruption: A case of
   an Indian automobile manufacturing supply chain},
Journal = {OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH},
Abstract = {In recent years, supply chains seem to be moving more towards
   reconfiguring their networks to become more profitable. In the times of
   COVID-19, where the whole supply chains have been disrupted, suppliers
   are unable to supply, and manufacturers are unable to manufacture
   because of lockdowns in the various regions around the world. This
   pandemic can be compared to past earthquakes and tsunamis, as the
   coronavirus is also a natural disaster. Due to these past disruptions,
   organizations have taken many precautions and developed risk mitigation
   strategies to manage them. Because the COVID-19 outbreak shows the
   importance of new business perspectives like repurposing a viability
   strategy, that comes with sustainability and reconfigurability. Where
   reconfiguration focuses on adaptation, which directly means changes in
   resources and capabilities and repurposing focuses on a quick response
   solution to address the shortage. In this paper, a study has been done
   in two phases to model viability in an automobile supply chain during
   the COVID-19 times. In the first phase, a hybrid Multi-criteria Decision
   Making (MCDM) approach is used to get the best criteria and alternatives
   with sustainability and reconfigurability under consideration. The
   multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) model has been
   developed in the second phase. Suppliers' weight that is obtained will
   be used to get the optimal order and allocation. This model will help
   develop supply chain strategies to cope with situations that hinder the
   firm's competitiveness. A case study of an Indian automobile
   manufacturer has been taken to show the applicability and effectiveness
   of the proposed methodology using GAMS/CPLEX solver.},

Abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the behaviour of Listeria monocytogenes
   under fluctuating temperature comparing the efficacy of deterministic
   and stochastic methods for its prediction. In the first part of the
   study, a strain of L. monocytogenes was maintained at two different

   sampled for the quantitative determination. The first temperature regime
   lasted 204 hours with a fluctuation length of 12 hours whereas the
   second lasted 167 hours with a fluctuation length of 24 hours. A dynamic
   predictive model was implemented for the reproduction of the observed
   data. Model resolution has been carried out by using values of the
   recorded temperature as well as the value of the mean temperature, the
   kinetic mean temperature, the 75th and 95th percentile of the
   temperature. A stochastic resolution was also performed considering the
   mean temperature and Standard Deviation as stochastic variable. In the
   second part of the study, a temperature mean curve was constructed by
   monitoring temperature of 8 refrigerated conveyances, 10 display cabinet
   and 15 domestic refrigerators. This curve was used to obtain predictive
   scenarios for L. monocytogenes based on the above and also considering
   temperature regime suggested by the EURL Lm TECHNICAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENT
   on challenge tests and durability studies for assessing shelf-life of
   ready-to-eat foods related to Listeria monocytogenes (Version 4 of 1
   July 2021). All predicted behaviours were compared to the observed ones
   through the Root Mean Squared Error. Firstly, dynamic predictive model
   as well as the stochastic one, provided the best level of
   reproducibility of the observed data. The kinetic mean temperature
   reproduced the observed data better than the mean temperature for the 12
   hoursregime while for the 24 hours-regime was the opposite. The 75th and
   95th percentile overestimated the observed growths. Secondary,
   predictions obtained with the mean temperature, kinetic temperature and
   stochastic approach well fitted the observed data. The 75th and 95th
   percentile of Temperature and the ``Eurl LM{''} temperature regimes
   overestimated the observed prediction. Dynamic approach as well as the
   stochastic one allowed to obtain the lowest values of Root Mean Squared
   Error. The mean temperature and kinetic mean temperature appeared the
   most representative values in a deterministic ``single-point{''}
   approach.},

Title = {Actor-network theory and the evolution of complex adaptive supply

Abstract = {Purpose
   Current understandings of innovation in construction portray it as
   linear, deterministic phenomena centered around novel objects and
   technologies deployed in sequentially-organized supply chains. This
   study aims to develop an enriched understanding of construction
   innovation as non-linear, socio-material and dynamic phenomena in
   complex networks by formulating a novel conceptual apparatus of complex
   adaptive supply networks (CASNs) expanded through actor-network theory
   (ANT) concepts.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This combined CASN/ANT apparatus is mobilized in the context of a
   qualitative case study involving a housing construction supply network
   in Australia making use of offsite manufacturing (OSM) techniques.
   Findings
   The study shows that innovative technologies such as novel OSM products
   can play an important though not necessarily deterministic role in the
   evolution of CASNs. The study also explicates the process by which the
   enrollment of non-human agents and the resulting CASN evolution are
   linked: innovative technologies shape human and non-human interactions
   in ways that redefine task delegation, role definition and schemas that
   are fundamental to the shape of CASNs.
   Originality/value
   Findings provide a compelling empirical basis for arguing that CASNs
   must be conceptualized as heterogeneous systems and that innovation in
   construction must be understood as non-linear, socio-material and
   dynamic, rather than linear and driven by technological determinism. The
   study also interrogates limiting notions of supply chains and supports
   the notion of alternative inter-organizational forms to understand
   construction project work.},

   delineate humanitarian supply chain (HSC) management from commercial
   supply chain management and further discuss the HSC from the point of

   possible linkages using extant literature and interpretive structural

Abstract = {In the context of a dynamic and hypercompetitive business environment,
   effective supply chain design helps organisations to align resources for
   improved flow of products and services and satisfy customers' diverse
   needs. Scholars have proposed several mutually exclusive supply chain
   designs such as efficient versus responsive, and lean versus agile.
   Quantitative testing has revealed that supply chain designs of many
   firms do not match with what was conceptually expected. To address this
   mismatch, in this study, a new approach to supply chain leagility is
   introduced and the impact of uncertainty as the key design driver of
   supply chains on leagility is investigated. The partial least squares
   (PLS) was employed to analyse data collected from 299 Australian firms
   by administering a structured questionnaire. Results indicate that
   higher performance is achievable on minimising the deviation from a
   balanced supply chain in which aspects of both leanness and agility are
   equally embedded. Further, the level of uncertainty directly and
   positively affects the Deviation from Leagility (DFL) index.},

Abstract = {Supply chains operating in informal sector of emerging economies are
   mostly characterised by inefficiencies, highly price sensitive
   customers, fragmented markets, frequent operational disturbances, and
   members with irrational profit seeking behaviour (naive members). We
   focus on cost disturbances and measure their effects in terms of demand
   variation (QV) in muti-echelon informal supply chain. We show how naive
   members contribute to amplification and transmission of QV across the
   supply chain. Strategic members (characterised by rational profit
   seeking behaviour) on the contrary, dampens the transmission of QV.
   Efficient reconfiguration solutions are proposed which minimize the QV
   for a specific cost disturbance scenario. Rational profit seeking
   behaviour is one of the criteria for selecting members in this
   reconfiguration. Rapid reconfiguration in these supply chains is
   possible due to the existence of informal contracts. A robust deviation
   reconfiguration solution is also proposed which performs satisfactorily
   over entire disturbance scenario set. Goodness of this solution is
   evaluated according to two metrics; namely cost penalty and robust
   efficiency. Lastly, an illustrative case study on apparel supply chain
   is presented and it is inferred from the discussion that large
   aggregators are both cost and robust efficient, hence their presence in
   supply chain improves performance of robust solution along the two
   metrics (cost penalty, robust efficiency). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Modeling supply chain viability and adaptation against underload
   cascading failure during the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {NONLINEAR DYNAMICS},
Abstract = {Supply chain viability concerns the entire supply system rather than one
   company or one single chain to survive COVID-19 disruptions. Mobility
   restriction and overall demand decline lead to systematically cascading
   disruptions that are more severe and longer lasting than those caused by
   natural disasters and political conflicts. In the present study, the
   authors find that large companies and manufacturers with traditional
   advantages suffer greater losses than small ones, which is
   conceptualized as the ``Hub Paradox{''} by empirically investigating one
   Warp Knitting Industrial Zone of China. An underload cascading failure
   model is employed to simulate supply chain viability under disruptions.
   Numerical simulations demonstrate that when the load decreases beyond a
   threshold, the viability will drop down critically. Besides, supply
   chain viability depends on two aspects: the adaptive capability of the
   manufacturers themselves and the adaptive capability of the connections
   of the supply network. The comparison study demonstrates that enhancing
   cooperative relations between hub and non-hub manufacturers will
   facilitate the entire supply network viability. The present study sheds
   light on viable supply chain management. Compared with conventionally
   linear or resilient supply chains, intertwined supply networks can
   leverage viability with higher adaptation of redistributing production
   capacities among manufacturers to re-establish overall scale advantages.
   Finally, the present study also suggests solving the ``Hub Paradox{''}
   from the perspective of complex adaptive system.},

Abstract = {Digitalization of the supply chain (SC) has received plenty of attention

   practice of achieving sustainability which is of utmost significance for
   achieving sustainable development goals established by the United
   Nations. This study empirically examines the relation among flexibility,
   AI-IoT adoption, and SC firm performance under the circular economy (CE)
   environment based on resource orchestration theory (ROT), an integrated
   version of the extended-resource-based view, and dynamic capability
   theory (DCT). Data were collected from Indian manufacturing firms
   through a questionnaire-based survey and examined using ``structural
   equation modeling (SEM).{''} The study results show that information
   flexibility and organizational flexibility have the highest impact on
   AI-IoT adoption. Organizational flexibility shows full mediation with
   AI-IoT, which would influence the SC firm performance directly. The
   analysis also indicates that CE will affect the relation between
   organizational flexibility and AI-IoT adoption. These findings pave the

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {This article empirically examines the effect of big data analytics (BDA)
   on healthcare supply chain (HSC) innovation, supply chain
   responsiveness, and supply chain resilience under the moderating effect
   of innovation leadership in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   scanning interpretation-action-performance model and organization
   information processing theory are used to explain BDA, HSC innovation,
   responsiveness, and resilience relationships. First, the hypotheses were
   tested using data collected from 190 experienced respondents working in
   the healthcare industry. Our structural equation modeling analysis using
   the partial least squares (PLS) method revealed that BDA capabilities
   play a pivotal role in building a responsive HSC and improving
   innovation, which has contributed to resilience during the current
   pandemic situation. High innovation leadership strengthens the effect of
   BDA capabilities on HSC innovation. High innovation leadership also
   increases the effect of BDA capabilities on responsiveness. Second, we
   validated and supplemented the empirical research findings using inputs
   collected in 30 semistructured qualitative questionnaires. Our article
   makes a unique contribution from the perspective of innovation
   leaderships. In particular, we argue that the role of innovative
