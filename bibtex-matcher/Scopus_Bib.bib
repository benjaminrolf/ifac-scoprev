abstract={This paper advances our knowledge of information systems (IS) by drawing ideas and insights from IT/IS evaluation. The emergence and increasing pressure to invest in new IS architecture and infrastructures has become a high priority issue within organisations, and largely influenced by the need to deliver better value products and service through robust and responsive supply chains. With this in mind, business managers are seeking to use appropriate methods and techniques to appraise and justify the financial contribution of IS at strategic, operational and tactical levels. Thus, comprehensive but understandable methodologies are needed to solve the complicated project justification problems arising from the complexity of new technologies. Notwithstanding, a wide body of literature has emerged that sheds light on various methods for evaluating the cost and benefits of IT/IS investment, ranging from simple to very complex techniques. This paper sets out to provide a review of this literature in order to lend insights into our understanding of the plethora of reported research in the literature that has propagated investment justification and benefits management models and frameworks. We show that the IT/IS evaluation literature contributes significantly to scholarship on the IS. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This study investigates the effects of entrepreneurial leadership on supply chain innovation and supply chain adaptability. Based on theoretical foundations of the upper echelon theory and the dynamic capability theory, it also assesses the mediating role played by supply chain innovation in the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and supply chain adaptability. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed on survey data collected from 139 firms in Sudan, Japan, and China. The results reveal that entrepreneurial leadership had positive effects on supply chain innovation and supply chain adaptability despite varying business environments. The results also provided interesting findings regarding the moderating role of supply chain innovation as a mediator of the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and supply chain adaptability. The findings of the study stress the importance of entrepreneurial leadership for firms’ adaptability across nations. Although the number of countries included in this study was limited, these countries exhibit different cultural and structural settings. These findings suggest the possibility of the generalizability of the results. The findings also imply that firms should place greater emphasis on improving their supply chain processes and upgrading relevant technologies in order to facilitate the development of adaptable supply chains. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Purpose: This study investigates the relationships among innovation by logistics services provider (LSP), user's supply chain (SC) adaptability, and the level of the user-provider relationship integration. Using low integrated, standard contractual relationships as a reference group, this study assesses how moderately integrated partnerships and highly integrated strategic relationships moderate the impact of LSP's innovation on the user's SC adaptability. Methodology: Moderated partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed on survey data collected from 48 Sudanese companies. Findings: The findings revealed that innovation by LSPs had the greatest positive impact on SC adaptability in firms maintaining a moderate level of logistics integration. Interestingly, firms highly integrated with their LSPs witnessed a reduced effect of logistics innovation on their SC adaptability. In other words, while user-provider partnerships reinforced the impact of LSPs' innovation on user's SC adaptability, strategic relationships weakened this impact. Originality: Extant literature advocates fully integrating with LSPs to build a responsive, efficient SC. Nevertheless, the complexities of managing a highly integrated relationship with LSPs may pose challenges that exceed the expected benefits of such relationships. This study provides empirical evidence that moderate, rather than full, integration with LSPs may yield greater benefits for the users of logistics services. © 2021 Proceedings of the Hamburg International Conference of Logistics.

abstract={In this article, we address two network design problems for a responsive supply chain that consists of make-to-order (make-to-assemble) facilities facing stochastic demand and service time. The response time to customer orders, critical to the success of the supply chain, is the sum of the flow time in the facility and the delivery time to the customers. The response time performance in our models is measured by the probability that the response time is shorter than a constant. This nonlinear performance measure makes the models less or not tractable. The objective of both problems is to minimize the expected network cost that consists of the cost of delivery to customers as a function of the time of delivery (or the mode of transportation), the fixed cost of locating facilities and the capacity cost as a linear function of the processing capacity. The main decision variables are the number and locations of facilities, the resources allocated to them and the delivery mode selected between facilities and demand. In the first problem, a constraint is imposed to ensure an acceptable response time level. In the second problem, a penalty is charged on the number of days that each unit is delivered later than the targeted response time and is incorporated into the objective function. In the first problem, the probabilistic constraint on the flow time can be linearized and the problem can be formulated as an integer linear programming model. In the second problem, we propose an approximation approach to linearize the objective function and an iterative search and cut algorithm to combine linear approximation with neighborhood search. A multi-start meta-heuristic is also suggested. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of these solution procedures. Recommendations are made on the basis of the computational results. This appears to be the first study in the area of locating capacitated facilities with stochastic demand to incorporate the delivery mode choice decision and to evaluate the expected congestion cost as a function of the actual flow time in the facilities, instead of the average one. The models developed enable the decision maker to investigate the effect of a combination of facility location, capacity allocation, and delivery mode decisions on the expected network cost and the response time. In addition, the findings of the computational experiments shed light on tuning parameters of approximation algorithms. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={In this paper we address the network design of a responsive supply chain consisting of make- To-order (make- To- Assemble) facilities facing stochastic demand from customers residing at nodes of a network. Each facility has a finite (processing) capacity and thus the stochasticity of demand may lead to congestion delays at the facilities. The objective is to determine the number, locations and capacities of the facilities so as to minimize the total network cost. We consider three problems. In the first, we minimize the total network cost which includes delivery and capacity costs while maintaining an acceptable response time to customers. In the second, a penalty is charged on the number of units that are delivered later than the targeted response time. In the third the penalty charged depends also on the number of days that the delivery is late. In both problems 2 and 3 the penalty cost is a function of network's response time.},

abstract={Floating substructures for wind turbines are commonly credited for enabling the offshore wind industry, so far focused on fixed substructures, to expand into deeper waters. As per Arent et al. (Improved offshore wind resource assessment in global climate stabilization scenarios, [4]), 77% of global offshore wind potential is located in water depths deeper than 60 m. However, floating substructures do not yet meet the market expectations with regard to LCOE. By integrating new materials as well as modularity into the design, the costs of the tension leg platform (TLP) development presented in this pater have been significantly reduced. Pre-stressed Ultra-High-Performance-Concrete (UHPC) pipes will be used for this sub-structure. The buoyancy bodies will be fabricated using concrete shell elements known from tunnel engineering. The use of casted iron for the nodes and the Transition Piece (TP) leads to further advantages regarding design and costs. All components are designed for transportability (e.g. via railway) in order to ensure a high level of flexibility within the supply chain. The structural design has been calculated to support turbines of up to 6 MW rated power and more. In October 2017, a scaled model (1:50) of the new substructure design for use with a 6 MW turbine was successfully exposed to wind and wave loads at the Ocean Engineering Tank of the École Centrale de Nantes (ECN). In June 2018, a second measurement campaign was started, and in September 2018 a third campaign will be run to verify the transport & installation process. Th presentation and paper will focus on the TLP design as well as on the model fabrication and scaling. Furthermore, measurement results from the ECN test will be presented. Therefore, the presentation will introduce the measurement setup as well as the measurement types to verify the simulation model. Finally, the verification of the simulation model with the measurements will be highlighted. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to examine the common roots of both logistics and sustainability phenomena in supply chains to derive a new potential construct, green logistics competency. Design/methodology/approach: Theoretical synthesis and conceptualization of new construct. Findings: Based on Madhavaram and Hunt’s (2008) resource hierarchy concept, the key to successfully competing with a sustainable supply chain may lie in whether the resources enabling both sustainability and effective supply chains are interdependent, as opposed to merely co-existent. Research limitations/implications: Most current theory regarding sustainable supply chains regards environmentally-friendly factors as resources that are additively bundled with supply chain resources. To determine if competitive performance differentials exist between truly green supply chains, and supply chains that merely adopt green practices, measurement must account for both the interdependence of green and supply chain resources, and their common cultural antecedents. Practical implications: The study indicates that it is not sufficient for firms to have expertise in both sustainability and in supply chain practices; managers in each of those areas must develop the cultural antecedents of both supply chain and sustainability excellence if firms are to achieve meaningful competitive capabilities through sustainable supply chains. Originality/value: This conceptual study addresses a paucity of theory describing how and why organizations build a genuinely green supply chain, as opposed to simply adapting supply chains to green practices. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework for extending an understanding of resilience in complex adaptive system (CAS) such as supply chains using the adaptive cycle framework. The adaptive cycle framework may help explain change and the long term dynamics and resilience in supply chain networks. Adaptive cycles assume that dynamic systems such as supply chain networks go through stages of growth, development, collapse and reorientation. Adaptive cycles suggest that the resilience of a complex adaptive system such as supply chains are not fixed but expand and contract over time and resilience requires such systems to navigate each of the cycles’ four stages successfully. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses the adaptive cycle framework to explain supply chain resilience (SCRES). It explores the phases of the adaptive cycle, its pathologies and key properties and links these to competences and behaviors that are important for system and SCRES. The study develops a conceptual framework linking adaptive cycles to SCRES. The goal is to extend dynamic theories of SCRES by borrowing from the adaptive cycle framework. We review the literature on the adaptive cycle framework, its properties and link these to SCRES. Findings: The key insight is that the adaptive cycle concept can broaden our understanding of SCRES beyond focal scales, including cross-scale resilience. As a framework, the adaptive cycle can explain the mechanisms that support or prevent resilience in supply chains. Adaptive cycles may also give us new insights into the sort of competences required to avoid stagnation, promote system renewal as resilience expands and contracts over time. Research limitations/implications: The adaptive cycle may move our discussion of resilience beyond engineering and ecological resilience to include evolutionary resilience. While the first two presently dominates our theorizing on SCRES, evolutionary resilience may be more insightful than both are. Adaptive cycles capture the idea of change, adaptation and transformation and allow us to explore cross-scale resilience. Practical implications: Knowing how to prepare for and overcoming key pathologies associated with each stage of the adaptive cycle can broaden our repertoire of strategies for managing SCRES across time. Human agency is important for preventing systems from crossing critical thresholds into imminent collapse. More importantly, disruptions may present an opportunity for innovation and renewal for building more resilience supply chains. Originality/value: This research is one of the few studies that have applied the adaptive cycle concept to SCRES and extends our understanding of the dynamic structure of SCRES. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Today, despite the fact that most of the supply chains have a suitable structure and high operative effectiveness, quick changes in the business environment, the high number of innovations, customer's expectations and requirements, increased communication between suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors all contribute to high levels of uncertainty, disruptions, chaotic behaviors, challenges and threats in supply changes. These unexpected risks and natural inevitable changes force supply chain management to adopt new and innovative approaches in order to deal better with risk-related disruptions.The resilient supply chain is one of these approaches. The goal of this study is to use the grounded theory method to investigate the concept of resilience and identify each of the resilience factors in supply chain studies. Adaptability, reversibility/recovery, versatility, reactivity, response to disruption, and the ability to continue working in difficult situations were identified as six main concepts for improving supply chain resilience as a result of analyses. This article will help researchers in their understanding of the concept of supply chain resilience and the factors that influence it. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Cloud computing is widely believed to be the future of computing. It has grown from being a promising idea to one of the fastest research and development paradigms of the computing industry. However, security and privacy concerns represent a significant hindrance to the widespread adoption of cloud computing services. Likewise, the attributes of the cloud such as multi-tenancy, dynamic supply chain, limited visibility of security controls and system complexity, have exacerbated the challenge of assessing cloud risks. In this paper, we conduct a real-world case study to validate the use of a supply chaininclusive risk assessment model in assessing the risks of a multicloud SaaS application. Using the components of the Cloud Supply Chain Cyber Risk Assessment (CSCCRA) model, we show how the model enables cloud service providers (CSPs) to identify critical suppliers, map their supply chain, identify weak security spots within the chain, and analyse the risk of the SaaS application, while also presenting the value of the risk in monetary terms. A key novelty of the CSCCRA model is that it caters for the complexities involved in the delivery of SaaS applications and adapts to the dynamic nature of the cloud, enabling CSPs to conduct risk assessments at a higher frequency, in response to a change in the supply chain. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Efficient procurement and utilization of woody biomass for bioenergy production requires a good understanding of biomass supply chains. In this paper, a dynamic optimization model has been developed and applied to estimate monthly supply and procurement costs of woody biomass required for the Atikokan Generating Station (AGS) in northwestern Ontario, based on its monthly electricity production schedule. The decision variables in the model are monthly harvest levels of two types of woody biomass, forest harvest residues and unutilized biomass, from 19,315 forest depletion cells (each 1 km2) for a one year planning horizon. Sixteen scenarios are tested to examine the sensitivity of the cost minimization model to changing economic and technological parameters. Reduction in moisture content and improvement of conversion efficiency showed relatively higher reductions in monthly and total costs of woody biomass feedstock for the AGS. The results of this study help in understanding and designing decision support systems for optimal biomass supply chains under dynamic operational frameworks. © 2012 by the authors.},

abstract={The miniaturization and modularization of production capacity brings with it not only greater agility and efficiency, but also increased flexibility in the form of mobility. This flexibility allows production capacity to be moved when and where it is most needed, generating new business opportunities, e.g., allowing modular units to be rented, leased, or shared. This flexibility, however, requires information and control systems that ensure a correct and secure flow of information between different stakeholders of the supply chain. Based on this, the present article characterizes the concept of software-defined mobile supply chains, presenting its main requirements, opportunities, and limitations. In addition, we present two case studies in which the proposed concept is evaluated in order to demonstrate its applicability. Here, due to the new optimization problems that arise when considering mobile facilities, special interest is given to the planning and control of the required operations, as well as the difficulties associated with the exchange of physical and intellectual assets between different stakeholders. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Purpose: the purpose of this paper is to provide academics and practitioners theoretical, and conceptual framework of the Iceberg Problem Solving Tool "IPST" as a generic problem solving tool for an effective supply chain management process. This leverages Organizational learning, organizational culture and corporate knowledge in implementing changes. The "IPST" is the moderator between the supply chain business process reengineering of the process changes and systems thinking approach for improvement. Design/Methodology/approach: A theoretical framework is developed from the systems thinking literature; linking integrated system thinking to firm supply chain sustainability. Theoretical versus practical integrated thinking approaches are applied to contrast the rigid management of sustainability with a model that focuses on relationships and broader indicators of societal supply chain business dynamic issues. Illustrations of the conceptualized framework are presented for discussion and for further empirical research. Findings: The (IPST) the Iceberg Problem Solving Tools is a practical tool for the current repetitive events in complex business environments of the supply chain. The tool helps the business management, in seeing the entire effects of the pining emerging events within the firm's supply chain business process; where small changes in the leverage points of the chain business processes or system process lead to tremendous results in the performance of the firm's supply chain. Practical implication: Potential firms supply chain crises can arise if the daily business events are not well analysed this will impact the root causes; by taking the right actions for the right causes of the business events to avoid management quick win failures. The implemented action taken will occur by placing the triggers of the supply chain events in its original form; within the main workflow process; this will have the effect of implementing the best results of the "IPST" in any supply chain business scenarios. Routines and practices will be based on cross-function process analysis through the whole system flow chart diagram of the supply chain to avoid the pain points of the business events. Originality/value: Within theoretical roots in systems thinking, this paper contributes to the relatively unexplored area of the iceberg model of the system thinking tools as a practical business problem-solving tool; for the complexity of the supply chain business events. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

Case overview/synopsis: The case deals with a typical challenge of periodical delivery systems, in this case specifically of The Topical, an Indian periodical. The service manager of the company, Sara Jindal, recognized a problem with customer retention. She explored the causes and found that The Topical, a 20-year-old company, was losing its popularity due to the untimely delivery of the magazines. To solve the problem Jindal, tried to gain an understanding of the operational processes and realized that there was no issue in the warehouse regarding inventory control, management or order pickup. However, she found that the magazines were parceled through book post and that there was no tracking policy in the company for the deliveries. Therefore, it was not possible to know whether the magazines got delivered on time. The matter was taken seriously and as a solution, the possibility of integrating drones into the delivery system came up.

abstract={In this paper, a multi-echelon closed-loop supply chain network is modeled considering pricing decisions and queuing system under uncertainty. The mathematical model's objective is to maximize the net present value (NPV) under uncertain parameters of potential demand and transportation costs. Therefore, the sensitivity of the actual demand on the pricing decisions of the final and returned products in the supply chain network. The main decisions of the mathematical model are to maximize the NPV related to the location of potential facilities, determine the amount of product inventory in the production center, reduce the length of the queue of production lines and determine the optimal amount of product transfer flow between facilities. Also, the most important decisions related to the related network are determining the optimal price of final products and returns in the supply chain network. Flexible Robust-Fuzzy optimization (FRFO) method is used to control the uncertainty parameters and the four algorithms G-HHO, PSO, ALO and GWO are used to solve the problem. The calculation results show that with the increase of uncertainty in the network, the value of NPV decreases and also with the increase of the number of production lines, due to the reduction of the queue length of the parts, the cost of waiting time decreases and the value of NPV increases. On the price of final and return products, the price in the forward and backward chain has increased and as a result, the NPV value has increased. By analyzing more tests, it was also observed that the G-HHO algorithm obtained the highest average NPV value in solving large numerical examples. While the PSO algorithm has reached the near-optimal solution in the shortest time. Also, there has been no significant difference between the averages of the comparison indices between the solution algorithms. Examination of the solution results between the solution methods shows that the maximum relative difference between the results is less than 5%, and the proposed G-HHO algorithm has the highest efficiency in solving large sample problems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The model has been tested with numerical examples, and sensitivity analyses. The findings showed that adopting delays-in-payments improves both environmental and economic performance of a supply chain. The analyses also showed that optimizing one of the parameters from the production rate, the length of delay-in-payments or the lot size provides the optimal solution for carbon emissions and the system cost of a supply chain. This flexibility makes the model easy to use by practitioners. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has been developed for decades as a solution for multi-level social and environmental improvement. Circular economy (CE) also has many perspectives and generally has been introduced for investigating sustainability at multiple levels. Organizations are informed and encouraged by management theories to build their supply chain strategies at the SSCM-CE nexus, including stakeholder theory, institutional theory, nature resource-based view, amongst others. As the scholarly and practical interests in SSCM and CE increase, there is a need to expand the current conceptual understanding and theoretical boundaries. Theory development for broader issues at the SSCM-CE nexus is limited, leaving managers, policy makers, civil society activists, and other stakeholders with insufficient grounding for important decisions and direction. In this paper, we explore some promising emerging theories which may provide additional conceptual lenses for SSCM and CE, inlcuding organizational learning, social innovation, and social learning. We develop a dynamic sustainable supply chain-circular economy management framework as a conceptual map over which theoretical boundaries from the existing and emergent theories are overlaid.

abstract={Rough oppositions in today's global supply chain have forced business enterprises to focus attention on their supply chains. These issues have guided this research to introduce a qualitative measure to evaluate the reliability of any Supply chain network and develop a novel reliability-based robust design optimization approach to guarantee reliability requirements and minimize uncertainty impacts. A supply chain network design must maintain its efficiency over time while coping with the uncertainty in production and transportation. Analytical models for the determination of the risk involved in a supply chain network design are difficult to derive when uncertainty impacts are integrated. In this paper, a model of evaluating SCN is detailed first. Then, the methodology for the Reliability-based robust design optimization approach is provided. A case study is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Reliability measure and the developed Reliability-based robust design optimization model. Results from the case study have shown that by implementing the developed optimization approach, a SCN is able to achieve a 90% of required reliability while minimizing uncertainty impact. © IEOM Society International. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={Multiechelon supply chains are complex logistics systems that require flexibility and coordination at a tactical level to cope with environmental uncertainties in an efficient and effective manner. To cope with these challenges, mathematical programming models are developed to evaluate supply chain flexibility. However, under uncertainty, supply chain models become complex and the scope of flexibility analysis is generally reduced. This paper presents a unified approach that can evaluate the flexibility of a four-echelon supply chain via a robust stochastic programming model. The model simultaneously considers the plans of multiple business divisions such as marketing, logistics, manufacturing, and procurement, whose goals are often conflicting. A numerical example with deterministic parameters is presented to introduce the analysis, and then, the model stochastic parameters are considered to evaluate flexibility. The results of the analysis on supply, manufacturing, and distribution flexibility are presented. Tradeoff analysis of demand variability and service levels is also carried out. The proposed approach facilitates the adoption of different management styles, thus improving supply chain resilience. The model can be extended to contexts pertaining to supply chain disruptions; for example, the model can be used to explore operation strategies when subtle events disrupt supply, manufacturing, or distribution. © 2018 Almeida et al.

abstract={There is an increasing need for supply chains that can rapidly respond to fluctuating demands and can provide customised products. This supply chain design requires the development of flexibility as a critical capability. To this end, firms are considering Additive Manufacturing (AM) as one strategic option that could enable such a capability. This paper develops a conceptual model that maps AM characteristics relevant to flexibility against key market disruption scenarios. Following the development of this model, a case study is undertaken to indicate the impact of adopting AM on supply chain flexibility from four major flexibility-related aspects: volume, mix, delivery, and new product introduction. An inter-process comparison is implemented in this case study using data collected from a manufacturing company that produces pipe fittings using Injection Moulding (IM). The supply chain employing IM in this case study shows greater volume and delivery flexibility levels (i.e., 65.68% and 92.8% for IM compared to 58.70% and 75.35% for AM, respectively) while the AM supply chain shows greater mix and new product introduction flexibility, indicated by the lower changeover time and cost of new product introduction to the system (i.e., 0.33 h and €0 for AM compared to 4.91 h and €30,000 for IM, respectively). This work will allow decision-makers to take timely decisions by providing useful information on the effect of AM adoption on supply chain flexibility in different sudden disruption scenarios such as demand uncertainty, demand variability, lead-time compression and product variety. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={In the past few decades, competition has increased between organizations as a result of globalization and fast development in IT. Companies these days are continuously looking to expand their market geographically to attract new customers. With that in mind, the main concern of companies is to achieve their customers' requirements, which makes the supply chain (SC) longer and more complex. This leads to increased difficulty in managing the SC along with controlling risks and disruptions in SC. Such as loss of a critical supplier, a fire accident in the production facility, or an act of terrorism. To deal with these risks, SC must be designed to provide an efficient and effective response, keep its process working and be capable of recovering to their original state after disruptive events, this is considered as the core of supply chain resilience (SCRes). Furthermore, companies that design their SC with capabilities to react quickly to any disruptions in its process have the opportunity to become more stabilized and acquire an improved position in the market. Researchers have been exploring ways to acquire supply chain resilience, such as encouraging and improving collaboration between SC partners or by increasing the organization's visibility through monitoring SC events and patterns. Studies have shown that IT has a role in improving SCRes, such as information-sharing systems to promote collaboration and visibility tactics. However, recent research trends are exploring new and emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT). Despite the growing interest in IoT, minimal research has been carried out for its application in SCRes. Research in this direction is necessary to explore opportunities provided by IoT to redesign SC which in turn reinforces flexibility of supply chains and aspects of analysis of the product quality and how it could enable companies to improve their SCRes. This study is directly focused to identify and highlight this gap. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Supply chain literature shows that speed of delivery, or equivalently provided delivery lead time, is a crucial performance factor and influences the expected customer demand. However, short delivery lead times imply stochastic demand peaks, for which production economics literature indicates that flexible capacity can be applied to mitigate their negative effects. In this paper a two stage supply chain with flexible capacity at the supplier and lead time dependent demand at the customer is investigated. Specifically, the random customer demand depends on the delivery lead time provided by the supplier and demand which cannot be fulfilled is lost. An analytical model is developed which includes predefined steady capacity and a demand dependent decision for flexible capacity. The trade-off between lost sales due to the provided delivery lead time, lost sales due to a lack of capacity, inventory cost and the cost for flexible capacity is discussed. Numerical results indicate that high capacity flexibility is needed if lost sales cost, demand variance, or customer lead time sensitivity is high. Furthermore, the positive effect of information sharing within the supply chain is evaluated. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel advanced buyback (ABB) contract to coordinate a supply chain that consists of one supplier and one retailer. The contract stipulates when a buyback contract is executed and the amount of buyback. We model the interaction of supply chain participants as a Stackelberg game and incorporate the participants’ reservation profits into the game to examine the effectiveness of the ABB contract with complete information. We demonstrate that the ABB contract can conveniently coordinate the supply chain, flexibly allocate profit, and facilitate avoidance of the aggressive overordering behavior of the retailer. This model is extended to the situation of information asymmetry, where the retailer holds private information about the cost of sales in discrete or continuous states. The optimal strategies of the supply chain and the participants are derived. Information asymmetry can damage the supplier but be beneficial to the retailer. The condition under which the supply chain achieves coordination is clarified. A numerical simulation is performed to verify and extend the results of the theoretical analysis. We show that the ABB contract always outperforms the ordinary wholesale price and buyback contracts with complete information. Supply chain coordination is more likely to be achieved if the demand variability is lower when weighing whether to share private information. Our findings can explain why retailers always have an incentive to inflate their cost of sales. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Worldwide business organizations realize that agility of sustainable supply-chain is a requisite need for survival in a dynamic, competitive, and unpredictable market. The contribution of this research is to explore and evaluate sustainable agility in supply chains for a dairy manufacturing organization located in Saudi Arabia. Other contributions of this research are to update the literature about the different factors contributing to achieve agile supply chain, propose conceptual framework and assessment approach incorporating the relationships between sustainable supply-chain capabilities, enablers, and attributes, and shortlisting the agility barriers and how they would facilitate manufacturing organizations’ performance. The paper presents supply chain agility evaluation approach, which covers identification of agile supply-chain capabilities and drivers. It also presents a conceptual model and a framework to define agility level and barriers within the supply-chain. In the paper, fuzzy logic approach is preferred, owing to its capability to incorporate and deal with problems involving impreciseness and vagueness phenomena. Threshold-value in this study for the case organization is set to 0.24829. The outcome of the adopted approach indicates that 21 attributes performed below the threshold value; these attributes are further categorized as agility barriers. These are the barriers within their supply chain that impact the agility-level. For the case organization, the foremost priority is to enhance maintainability and serviceability to make it flexible and inexpensive to establish an agile responsive supply chain. At the same time, it should have priority to focus on development and integration of their core competencies to deal with cross-functional and cross-enterprise issues in supply chain. For the case organization, the agility level was found “very agile,” although it is below the “extremely agile.” Thus, a study was developed to understand the behaviour of the supply chain agility and assess/evaluate it to support decision makers in order to develop a strategic solution for different organizational barriers. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The aim of the research developed is to recognize the importance and impact of supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDC) in the horizontal collaboration as a relevant factor to mitigate the risks in the supply chain, but also to contribute to sustainability in SME’s that are located in emerging economies, even more face to the post-pandemic scenario. The methodology used to analyze the theoretical constructs related to the study was PRISMA declaration. It was applied using several databases (Scopus and Web of Science) and specific search equations investigating several lenses related to supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDC) as an adjuvant to create and promote horizontal collaborative networks (HCN). It mitigates the risks through collaborative processes between actors in the supply chain, developing resilience. The lenses considered are dynamic capabilities view, supply chain resilience and collaborative networks. The study results reveal that collaborative networks could support the risk management in supply chains that develop this practice. In the same way, supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDC) can be considered as a relevant factor in stimulating integration between different and exogenous actors of the supply chain in a horizontal collaboration, and also considering the collaboration as one of the most important supply chain dynamic capability (SCDC) to be developed for SME’s as a good way to dynamize their supply chains, avoid the risk and as a good practice to improve the corporate sustainability in emerging markets. © 2022, Czestochowa University of Technology.

abstract={Supply chains need to redesign their existing strategies and must develop new strategies to effectively face the challenges posed by certain disruptions, both man-made and natural. This requires the supply chains to be highly flexible, visible, reliable and cost-effective leading to the achievement of Agile Supply Chain (ASC). In today’s competitive market, achieving agility in supply chain needs dynamic leadership, strategic vision, mutual cooperation from all members and effective utilization of information technology through customer focus. In spite of their initiatives to achieve ASC for improving their organizational performance, barring a few large companies, the medium and small size manufacturing companies have not yet been able to adopt and design supply chains which lead to ASC. This may be due to various challenges in the process of achieving agility. Also, the published literature in this area is very scanty. Therefore, to fill this gap, the purpose of this study is to determine the mediating role of Information Sharing Strategy (ISS) on Agile Supply Chain (ASC) practices for achieving Supply Chain Performance (SCP) in medium size manufacturing companies in UAE. An empirical survey of supply chain managers in UAE is conducted for this purpose. It is found that information sharing plays a major mediating role in ASC to achieve superior supply chain performance. © 2020 by the authors; license Growing Science, Canada.},

abstract={Purpose: This study investigates the level of variance in the real time demand for bagged cement, induced in response to the climatic sequence of the humid tropics, to support best practice calls for a weather-responsive supply chain strategy. Design/methodology/approach: Data on the consumption of cement and site works for 100 ongoing building construction sites were gathered for a period of 12 months. The variance partitioning capabilities of the Ordinary Least Squares and Hierarchical Linear Modelling forms of regression analysis are comparatively used to evaluate the sensitivity of cement demand to the meteorological profile of wet-humid climate Findings: The study outcome provides statistical evidence demonstrating that the meteorological profile of wet-humid climate induces a significantly high percentage of the variance in the real-time demand for bagged cement on construction sites. However, nested within this variance, are the fixed effects of the cement footprint of the building architecture inherent in the locality. Particularly, positive changes to reduce the wet trade composition of buildings or compensating changes in technological bias, are necessary to combat weather interference in the humid tropics. Research limitations/implications: The findings are exploratory, and not for the purposes of holistically forecasting cement demand, and can therefore only form part of a more comprehensive decision support system, bespoke to the study area. Practical implications: The study outcome provides a back-end view to climatic adaptation in wet humid settings, making a compelling case for localized climate-risk adaptive supply chain strategies and policies geared towards sustainability in cement usage. Originality/value: The study delineates the confounding impact of weather, distinct from local building architecture and technological bias, thus creating a methodological platform for replication and comparative productivity studies in diverse geographical areas. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={ManufacturingMarket is a market in whichmanufacturing process capacity is the object of trade. In amarket, units of capacity, represented as manufacturing services, can be acquired as needed and when needed, thus making supply chains more responsive to fluctuations in supply and demand. Although Manufacturing Market can be built physically as a spot market, its benefits can be better realized in a web-based framework. We refer to the web-based version of Manufacturing Market as DigitalManufacturingMarket (DMM). The major challenges in deployment of a virtual market for manufacturing services include standard representation of manufacturing needs and capabilities, incorporation of intelligent supplier search and evaluation mechanism, and automation of supply chain configuration process. This paper introduces DMMthrough its major components including amulti-agent framework, a formal ontology for representation ofmanufacturing services as well as a matchmaking methodology used for connecting buyers and sellers of manufacturing services based on their semantic similarities. The ultimate goal of the proposed framework is to enable autonomous deployment of manufacturing supply chains based on the specific technological requirements defined by particular work orders. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

abstract={In 2017, disruptions in the global supply of helium reminded consumers, distributors, and policy makers that the global helium supply chain lacks flexibility, and that attempts to increase production from the U.S. Federal Helium Reserve (the FHR) may not be able to compensate for the loss of one of the few major producers in the world. Issues with U.S. and global markets for helium include inelastic demand, economic availability of helium only as a byproduct, only 4–5 major producers, helium’s propensity to escape earth’s crust, an ongoing absence of storage facilities comparable to the FHR, and a lack of consequences for the venting of helium. The complex combination of these economic, physical, and regulatory issues is unique to helium, and determining helium’s practical availability goes far beyond estimating the technically accessible volume of underground resources. Although most of these issues have been analyzed since helium was recognized to be a valuable mineral commodity in the early 1900s, very few economic models have been developed that adequately consider the unique characteristics of helium and helium markets. In particular, there is a notable lack of recent empirical work to estimate the responsiveness of helium demand, supply, prices, and trade patterns to the ongoing drawdown and sale of helium reserves stored in the FHR. In general, existing models of helium either do not account for an oligopoly controlling supply, or they do not evaluate potential helium extraction and storage programs based on an intertemporal maximization of the value of the resource. Such models could be of very limited use to decision makers. This review found only one working paper with a helium market model that has incorporated both of these vital considerations. That and other economic studies along similar lines could be very useful in helping inform current helium policy discussions and decisions. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Unreliable and nonexistent supply chain procedures and processes are one of the primary barriers to achieving functional community health units in nomadic communities in the arid/semiarid counties of Kenya. Methods: We used a human-centered design (HCD) approach to engage communities and community health volunteers (CHVs) in redesigning a proven data-centric supply chain approach that included a digital solution, called cStock, for this challenging context. We conducted the HCD process in 4 phases: (1) understanding intent, (2) research and insights, (3) ideation and prototyping, and (4) supply chain design and requirements building. Data collection used qualitative methods and involved a range of stakeholders including CHVs, supervisors, and local beneficiaries. CHVs and their supervisors also participated in cStock usability testing. Drawing on insights and personas generated from the research, stakeholders ideated and codesigned supply chain tools. Results: The research identified critical insights for informing the redesign of cStock for nomadic communities. These insights were categorized into supply chain, information systems, human resources, behaviors, service delivery infrastructure, and connectivity. Four supply chain data solutions were designed, prototyped, tested, and iterated: A stock recording paper-based form, a user-friendly cStock application, a supervisor cStock application, and an unstructured supplementary service data reporting system using feature phones. Conclusions: Using the HCD process incorporated the perspective of CHVs and their communities and provided key insights to inform the design of the supply chain and adapt cStock. The process helped make cStock to be inclusive and have the potential to have a meaningful impact on strengthening the supply chain for seminomadic and nomadic communities in northern Kenya. A strong supply chain for these CHVs will increase access to essential and reproductive health commodities and contribute to improving the overall health and well-being of these communities, especially women and children. © 2021 Johns Hopkins University Press.

Strategies are classified into reactive (buffering) and proactive (redesigning). We develop a framework that links supply chain uncertainty, the two types of strategies for achieving supply chain flexibility and the relevant objectives to be achieved. Four case studies are compared in terms of uncertainty typology and strategies being adopted to improve supply chain flexibility. We present three propositions as a result of the study. First, to achieve better flexibility, companies have been focusing more on buffering than on proactive or redesign strategies. Second, companies tend to focus on internal operations rather than collaborating with external parties, and third, the power structure in a supply chain governs the type and configuration of supply chain flexibility. © 2014 The Author(s).

abstract={The spread of the coronavirus has had a major impact on the global economy, highlighting the shortcomings and weaknesses of global supply chains. Major issues such as supply disruptions, shortages of raw materials and spare parts, restricted transport, and ineffective exchange of information between actors within the supply chain have resulted. The empirical evidence of these events is widely discussed in the literature, which has brought out the urgent need to rethink the configuration of customer-supplier relations at an overall level. One technology that is much discussed in the literature and potentially useful in supporting supply chain processes is the blockchain technology. Blockchain has been gaining attraction across different sectors, even if there are still few applications in supply chain management, most at an experimental level. The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential applications of blockchain to support supply chain processes, to fill the gaps highlighted during the Covid pandemic. Through the analysis of the literature, the authors aim to give a preliminary overview on the relationships between Covid-19 impacts and benefits achievable by the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain, for an effective supply chain reconfiguration in a post-covid era.

abstract={The present study aimed to assess the effect of implementing Rapid Prototyping (RP) in the product development phase on the sustainability of a conventional supply chain. The sustainability indicators of RP utilization were identified through a critical literature review and consulting two experienced RP practitioners to determine the key variables regarding the potential impact of RP on the supply chain components, with an emphasis on sustainability pillars. A generic system dynamics modeling was provided to simulate the RP-adapted supply chain and measure its sustainability performance. The simulation results indicated that RP utilization in the design phase could decrease the number of the assembly parts and material consumption in conventional manufacturing, while indirectly affecting the reduction of waste generation, logistics, CO2 emissions, processes, and the total costs which are related to environmental and economic aspects of the sustainable supply chain. Findings indicated that significant increase in operational skills and knowledge as the main indicators of the social dimension could remarkably reduce the failure rates and increase the quality of the products. This indicator plays a pivotal role in operational success and could be enhanced through training programs. Social sustainability indirectly affects environmental and economic sustainability. This was the first model-based research to examine the potential effects of RP on the sustainability of a conventional manufacturing. The proposed generic model encompassed the variables that could be applicable in every scenario to help decision-makers change values or add more variables within specific industry settings and choose the applicable ones, which in turn, accelerating the RP adoption in supply chains and providing insights for operational decisions regarding product design stage. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Enterprise risk management (ERM) has arguably become the dominant strategic management focus of organizations primarily due to a combination of factors-stakeholders' aversion to uncertainty, volatility of the current marketplace, and compliance mandates such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a theory of the impact of ERM on two aspects of organizational performance, strategic flexibility and supply chain performance. The study is designed to examine conflicting views on the effect of increased levels of governance on organizations' flexibility and supply chain performance, and determine whether ERM capability influences the observed differential effects. Building on theories related to the electronic integration perspective of firm agility and the role of knowledge integration on the activation of the link between strategic flexibility and performance, we develop a theory of ERM as an enabler of IT integration, flexibility, and performance. A cross-sectional field study of six companies illustrates the interrelationships and provides preliminary support for the theory. Subsequent testing using data from 155 Chief Audit Executives provides strong support for the theory. The results show that a broad-based, strategic approach to ERM enhances flexibility and strengthens the relationship between flexibility and performance. The results also provide evidence that enhanced IT integration is the mechanism through which ERM strengthens both flexibility and in turn performance. © 2015.},

abstract={Flexibility has a variety of dimensions attached with it. In the context of supply chain (SC), flexibility needs to be defined. In this paper, an attempt is made to describe various connotations attached with the flexibility, possible sources of variability and a proposed model on coordination by contracts. The contracts offer opportunities in implementing and measuring flexibility in SCs. Supply chain flexibility (SCF) measurement is presented while coordinating the SC. An analytical model based on newsboy problem is developed to understand implications of flexibility in a three-level SC. The proposed framework may act as a decision-making tool for selecting contracts for a particular type of demand based on a number of scenarios (varying price, cost and time period) generated. This framework may help SC members to decide which contract is beneficial under various situations of uncertainty. This paper has proposed a framework which by adopting SC contracts can be an indicator of SCF which can bear variability. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

A case study approach using qualitative methods was used to analyse the perishable F&V supply chains in a typical Indian metropolitan city. This study found that supply chain agents set their margins arbitrarily resulting in double marginalisation at each interface of the supply chains. Thus, double marginalisation and inefficiency in the domestic F&V supply chains results in massive wastage. F&V supply chains are impacted unequally and include food perishability, food quality and food safety based on the responsiveness of the supply chains. Insights found in this study will be useful, not only for F&V supply chain stakeholders, but also for policymakers to develop more efficient and responsive supply chain model in India and elsewhere with similar economic settings. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Today companies have to satisfy manifold and changing customer demands. However, the question why and under what circumstances certain product variants cause performance problems within value chain operations remains unsolved. Existing process descriptions, data-models and IT-systems are remarkably supporting planning and optimization efforts, but show significant deficits regarding the integration of heterogeneous internal and cross-company systems. Relevant issues such as the evaluation of demand variety impacts on the subsequent value-adding steps in the value chain are not sufficiently solved. Ontological modelling could notably advance the information exchange in complex value chains and thus enhance value chain flexibility through a semantic harmonization that enables faster and faultless information flows between companies. Further advantages are the distinct reusability, modifiability, extendibility and shareability of ontology-based value chain models and software. Despite a distinct need to advance cross-company integration, ontologies are used in supply chain management only occasionally. The need for methodical enhancement is high. Thus, the objective of this paper is to investigate obtainable benefits of ontological modelling for supply chain management (SCM) – here substantiated by means of a methodological support to improve product variety management in value networks. We provide a literature review, a conceptual framework and an implementation-guide for use in scenarios that represent the problems mentioned. The project-design was developed in an explorative feasibility study based on the sample case of an Austrian manufacturer. An achieved managerial insight that extends current SC-ontology contributions is a conceivable approach on how to gain a proof of concept for cross-company ontology application in value chains. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={This study aims to investigate the closed-loop supply chain network design problem considering the environmental and responsiveness features. For this purpose, a multi-objective mathematical model is suggested that minimizes the carbon emissions and the total costs and maximizes the responsiveness of the system. Due to the dynamic space of the business environment, uncertainty is an integral part of the supply chain problem. Therefore, this research applies the robust possibilistic programming method to cope with uncertainty. Afterwards, since the research problem has a high level of the complexity, a hybrid solution approach based on a heuristic method and the meta-goal programming method is developed to solve the research problem in a reasonable time. Then, due to the importance of the ventilator device during the recent pandemic (COVID-19), this study considers this product as a case study. The main contribution of the current study is to design a green-responsive closed-loop supply chain network under uncertainty using a multi-objective robust possibilistic programming model, for the first time in the literature, especially in the medical devices industry. On the other side, the other contribution of this study is to develop an efficient hybrid solution method. The achieved results demonstrate the efficiency of the offered model and the developed hybrid method. Eventually, by carrying out sensitivity analysis, the impact of some of the critical parameters on the model is investigated. Based on the obtained results, an increase in the demand sizes leads to increasing the environmental damages and the total costs while reducing the responsiveness level. On the other side, an increase in the rate of return leads to an increase in all of the objective functions. Also, the achieved results show that when the capacity parameter is increased, the total costs are decreased, but the responsiveness and environmental impacts are increased. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Increased global competition and complex patterns of customer demand have made supply chain management (SCM) extremely challenging for any company. Traditional SCM systems with centralized data storage architecture lead to data access and privacy challenges across the diverse spectrum of stakeholders in supply chain management. Blockchain alleviates the problem of data access and privacy but the task of developing an SCM solution over a blockchain from scratch is challenging, complex, and time-consuming. In this paper, we present our Nocode Development Platform (NCDP) that allows users to build customized SCM applications using a user-friendly interface. Once a customized supply chain is built, our platform autogenerates and deploys the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, thus easing the deployment of an SCM solution on the blockchain. A product can be tracked at any point in the supply chain using different tracking mechanisms. Our platform leverages the blockchain concept to provide supply chain data transparency in a secure manner to diverse stakeholders in a decentralized ecosystem. Our platform significantly reduces the time and investment to migrate existing SCM systems on the blockchain. © 2021 Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK-CACSUK.},

abstract={The concept of a supply chain exists for over twenty years but partners and configuration selection process still is rather unstructured. In order to increase value in any supply chain, a more comprehensive and integrative approach is required to select the right partners and establish the right configuration along the chain. Under economic growth, wrong decisions does not jeopardize profitability dramatically. However, recent economy downtrends has made the choice of suitable partners in the dynamic supply chain a key strategic concern. The nature of these decisions usually is complex and unstructured. This paper aims to present an intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral operator based approach to partners and configuration selection. In order to bring structure in the evaluation process, the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model developed by Supply Research Council is employed. The paper discusses the development of the value chain concept from partners selection perspective, outlines general similarities and differences of the value chain and the SCOR, and uses a simple V-form supply chain example to establish the proposed approach. Finally, results of the application and sensitivity of the results to the change in the selection criteria weights are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a recent and rapidly developing technology, which has brought about significant disruptions in the manufacturing arena. To capture the full spectrum of changes resulting from AM's introduction into the industry, it is not sufficient to look at it just as a disruptive set of technologies but, rather, take a system's approach. It must be noted that the investigation of AM's impacts cannot be limited to an individual actor, but should encompass the whole supply chain to fully consider the relevant changes in strategic as well as tactical decision-making and operations. This paper presents an analytic approach based on Joint Economic Lot Sizing model, and aims at capturing the most significant impacts resulting from the implementation of the AM concept on a two-level supply chain. This assessment of AM from inventory and logistics standpoints is targeted at providing insights into how manufacturers could adapt their supply chains’ planning to accommodate new paradigms introduced by AM. A numerical example followed by sensitivity analysis of a real industrial case study is presented to provide evidence for the main findings and further generalise them. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We describe SC-Ambidexterity as a simultaneous application of supply chain adaptability (SC-Adaptability) and supply chain alignment (SC-Alignment) capabilities. We also consider the role of supply chain agility (SC-Agility) in the relationship between SC-Ambidexterity and SC-Resilience. We further suggest that the relationship between SC-Ambidexterity and SC-Resilience may be stronger in case of higher market uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the dynamic capabilities view (DCV) of the firm, we develop a set of hypotheses that are tested through a survey of manufacturing firms in Pakistan. The hypothesized model is tested through structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: The results of this study show a positive effect of SC-Ambidexterity on SC-Resilience. SC-Agility positively mediates the relationship between SC-Ambidexterity and SC-Resilience. However, our results show that this relationship does not vary at different levels of environmental uncertainty.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the antecedents of dynamic supply chain capabilities (DSCCs). The authors test entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and supply chain learning orientation (SCLO) as two antecedents of DSCCs. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses structural equation modelling to test a hypothetical model. Data are gathered from a survey of 275 operations managers in Pakistan’s turbulent manufacturing industry. Findings: The findings suggest that the weaker direct effects of EO, in comparison to the indirect effects, indicate that an SCLO mediates the relationship between EO and DSCCs. Research limitations/implications: It is widely accepted that firms do not compete with each other, instead, it is end-to-end supply chains that fight for market dominance. Many scholars use the dynamic capabilities view to understand supply chain level competition. However, the dynamic capabilities view is firm-centric in its examination of how companies transform internal resources to compete in the external environment. The theoretical contribution of this paper is a roadmap of how to build dynamic, supply-chain level and capabilities by determining the key antecedents. This paper explains that DSCCs emerge when buyers and suppliers share strategic orientations. Firms with an EO and the ability to learn with supply chain partners are well-positioned to develop DSCCs. This provides a new angle to theory testing by indicating that dynamic capabilities are enabled by an EO and an ability to learn with supply chain partners. Practical implications: Managers are given the building blocks of DSCCs, starting with fostering an entrepreneurially-oriented mindset in the company and then learning with supply chain partners. Entrepreneurially-oriented managers are encouraged to take risks and co-develop innovative ideas with suppliers during the supply chain learning process. Originality/value: This study is one of the earliest efforts to determine the strategic orientations that antecede the emergence of DSCCs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We conceptualize dynamic capabilities of a firm as consisting of multiple levels. Capabilities at the highest level affect the formation of first order dynamic supply chain capabilities. Furthermore, first order capabilities modify the operational capabilities. We propose constructs for second and first order dynamic supply chain capabilities. Performance implications of dynamic supply chain capabilities have also been empirically tested based on data from 275 managers from Pakistani manufacturing industry. The results show a support for the assertions by dynamic capability theorists. © 2017 Johar Education Society, Pakistan.},

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in upstream pharmaceutical supply chains (PSC). One is that the global supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is overly dependent on few locations and large-scale batch manufacturing. Regulators hope to enable more dependable location decisions and improved processing quality with the adoption of advanced technologies such as process intensification through continuous manufacturing (CM). Conceptual work suggests that the benefits of shifting from batch to CM accrue end-to-end across the PSC. Yet detailed quantitative information about CM is limited at an early stage of evaluation, and too specialised to inform managerial decisions about PSC reconfiguration. Supply chain and engineering criteria are rarely combined in the early-stage evaluation of alternative CM technologies. Extant CM research typically overlooks implications for supply chain managers. To address the current gap, this article evaluates, at an early stage of adoption, alternative CM reactor technologies for the synthesis of APIs in selected therapeutic areas. With evidence from secondary data, relevant technologies and criteria are identified, and their relative importance is evaluated in a semi-quantitative fashion following analytical hierarchy process (AHP) principles, ensuring that findings are intelligible to both engineers and managers. The proposed empirical work enriches previous conceptual frameworks predicated on volume-variety considerations. Specifically, findings suggest that, all things considered, microreactor technologies outperform alternatives. However, PSC managerial considerations introduce nuances in specific therapeutic areas, for example, antivirals where a tension between complex chemistry and the need for flexibility in unit operations may favour batch manufacturing. For analgesics the need to exploit the existing manufacturing base whilst addressing inventory reduction favours technologies that incorporate elements of batch and CM. The proposed analysis is in line with real-world decisions that global medicines manufacturers are increasingly facing, as governments seek to develop local health countermeasures to the COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of detailed information. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Exploiting embedded supply-chain real options creates powerful opportunities for competitive manufacturing in high-cost environments. Rather than seeking competitiveness through standardization as is common to lean production, real-options reasoning explores opportunities to use supply-chain variability as a strategic weapon. We present an illustrative case study of a Swiss manufacturer of cable extrusion equipment supported by a formal real-options model that aids in valuing the embedded options that make up supply-chain flexibility: postponement, contraction, expansion, switching, and abandonment. Real-options reasoning provides a plausible retrospective rationale for the case firm's use of supply-chain flexibility that provided protection against competition from low cost, but less responsive competitors. Their intuitive real-options reasoning facilitated incorporating fuller information concerning volatility, flexibility, and control into choosing what products to make, in what quantity, and with work allocated to which supplier. The case study also highlights how competing through exploiting embedded real options requires a different managerial skill set than does competing through cost reduction. Skills such as customer communication, supplier management, and ability to ensure a smooth flow of production join the ability to reduce and control lead times as key sources of competitive advantage. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Complexities in today’s Supply Chain Networks (SCN) have exposed them to various risks, vulnerabilities, and disruptions. Recently, the Chinese $62 billion investment in the wake of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which includes a network of highways and railways projects, will be a milestone for regional connectivity. Through CPEC, China aims to connect its north-western province Xinjiang to global supply chain networks via Gwadar port Pakistan. Since 9/11, Pakistan has become a terrorism stuck state, resulting in the loss of political and economic stability, reducing the infrastructure development and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Under these circumstances, risk assessment of supply chain networks in a responsive way toward these problems is crucial for authorities. This paper aims to identify and investigate the relationship between supply chain risks using the Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) technique. Additionally, interdependencies among risks have been calculated, and classification is done via cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis based on corresponding dependency and driving power. Results show that political and economic stability has the highest driving power and lowest dependence power, indicating that all the risks are directly or indirectly associated with it. Simultaneously, epidemics and ecosystem changes have the highest dependence power and most insufficient driving power, which shows its significant dependency on other risks. Finally, based on our model, authorities can design a resilient supply chain network responsive to several risks, and efficient operations are assured. © 2021, Fudan University.},

abstract={In the last decade, environmental fluctuations of business activities have dictated to organisations to design their supply chains in an efficient way. Also, as regards the diverse needs of customers that is increasing day by day, the manufacturing and service industries cannot deal with these changes unless through contracting out some of their manufactured goods to improve their responsiveness, which is called outsourcing. This paper presents a multi-stage and multi-product mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to the responsive and flexible supply chain network design (SCND). The proposed model is able to consider outsourcing, transportation modes, flexibility, cross-docking issue and time monetary value, as a criterion to reduce delivery time, to improve responsiveness of supply chain. Computational results show the outsourcing process has significant effect on the number and location of facilities for opening. Sensitivity analysis illustrates the sensitivity of the proposed model to fixed opening costs, demand of customers and outsourcing costs. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The benefits of information sharing along supply chains are well known for improving productivity and reducing costs. However, with the shift toward more dynamic and flexible supply chains, privacy concerns severely challenge the required information retrieval. A lack of trust between the different involved stakeholders inhibits advanced, multi-hop information flows, as valuable information for tracking and tracing products and parts is either unavailable or only retained locally. Our extensive literature review of previous approaches shows that these needs for cross-company information retrieval are widely acknowledged, but related work currently only addresses them insufficiently. To overcome these concerns, we present PrivAccIChain, a secure, privacy-preserving architecture for improving the multi-hop information retrieval with stakeholder accountability along supply chains. To address use case-specific needs, we particularly introduce an adaptable configuration of transparency and data privacy within our design. Hence, we enable the benefits of information sharing as well as multi-hop tracking and tracing even in supply chains that include mutually distrusting stakeholders. We evaluate the performance of PrivAccIChain and demonstrate its real-world feasibility based on the information of a purchasable automobile, the e.GO Life. We further conduct an in-depth security analysis and propose tunable mitigations against common attacks. As such, we attest PrivAccIChain's practicability for information management even in complex supply chains with flexible and dynamic business relationships. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: A circular economy is a popular approach considered by many firms to address sustainable development goals strategically. Literature indicates that collaborative relationships among supply chain partners facilitate circular economy practices. However, there is a dearth of studies in lower-middle-income countries indicating the unique challenges industries face whilst practising circular economy principles and how the challenges can be overcome. To address the calls of previous researchers, this study aims to explore the following relationships: engagement and alliance capability whilst data analytics capability plays a mediating role; the relationship between alliance and data analytics capability with sustainable supply chain flexibility whilst industry dynamism is considered as a moderating variable and the relationship between sustainable supply chain flexibility and circular economy-target performance. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey was performed and data was collected from 760 employees of Indian firms. Covariance-based structural equation modelling was applied to perform the path analysis to determine a firm’s capabilities in shaping sustainable supply chain flexibility and enhancing circular economy target performance. Findings: Drawing upon dynamic capability theory, it was first established that engagement capability has a positive and significant influence on alliance capability, whilst data analytics capability played a partial mediating role. Second, it was established that alliance capability and data analytics capability significantly affect sustainable supply chain flexibility, whilst industry dynamism played a moderating role. Finally, it was clear that sustainable supply chain flexibility had a significant and positive effect on circular economy target performance, ultimately enhancing sustainability. Originality/value: This study advances the circular economy literature by recommending that firms must consider some critical operational level capabilities to develop their dynamic capability, i.e. sustainable supply chain flexibility, to better meet the competitive market conditions in turbulent business environments. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This article empirically examines the effect of big data analytics (BDA) on healthcare supply chain (HSC) innovation, supply chain responsiveness, and supply chain resilience under the moderating effect of innovation leadership in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The scanning interpretation&#x2013;action&#x2013;performance model and organization information processing theory are used to explain BDA, HSC innovation, responsiveness, and resilience relationships. First, the hypotheses were tested using data collected from 190 experienced respondents working in the healthcare industry. Our structural equation modeling analysis using the partial least squares (PLS) method revealed that BDA capabilities play a pivotal role in building a responsive HSC and improving innovation, which has contributed to resilience during the current pandemic situation. High innovation leadership strengthens the effect of BDA capabilities on HSC innovation. High innovation leadership also increases the effect of BDA capabilities on responsiveness. Second, we validated and supplemented the empirical research findings using inputs collected in 30 semistructured qualitative questionnaires. Our article makes a unique contribution from the perspective of innovation leaderships. In particular, we argue that the role of innovative leadership in the COVID-19 pandemic situation is critical as it indirectly affects HSC resilience when BDA is in place. IEEE},

abstract={Purpose: Worldwide, facing increasing resources pressure, more and more manufacturing firms aim to circular economy (CE), which is a system characterized by the application of remanufacturing principles and adoption of sustainable manufacturing practices. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the function of remanufacturing capability in influencing supply chain resilience in supply chain networks under the moderating effects of both flexible orientation and control orientation. Design/methodology/approach: Data were gathered through a survey performed online in South Africa, and 150 participants completed the survey. Participants were mainly industry professionals holding senior administrative positions. Findings: Results indicate that market factors, management factors and technical factors positively influence dynamic remanufacturing capability (DRC). More specifically, on one hand, market factors strongly influence DRC, whereas, on the other hand, both management and technical factors influence at lower level DRC. DRC has a positive influence on supply chain resilience. Flexible orientation is found to positively moderate the effect of DRC on supply chain resilience, whereas control orientation does not exert any moderating effect on DRC and supply chain resilience. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies that explore research gaps between current vs desired remanufacturing capability requirements to achieve sustainability goals in CE. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Due to the globalization in the semiconductor supply chain, counterfeit dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips/modules have been spreading worldwide at an alarming rate. Deploying counterfeit DRAM modules into an electronic system can have severe consequences on security and reliability domains because of their sub-standard quality, poor performance, and shorter life span. Besides, studies suggest that a counterfeit DRAM can be more vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. However, detecting counterfeit DRAMs is very challenging because of their nature and ability to pass the initial testing. In this paper, we propose a technique to identify the DRAM origin (i.e., the origin of the manufacturer and the specification of individual DRAM) to detect and prevent counterfeit DRAM modules. A silicon evaluation shows that the proposed method reliably identifies off-the-shelf DRAM modules from three major manufacturers. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The circular economy (CE) is an evolving economic and sustainable development model. In this new environment, companies face a more dynamic, uncertain, and complex market environment. These challenges arise from material closed-loop flows necessary for a functioning CE. It is important to build flexibility capabilities into sustainable supply chains to address CE operational challenges. Building this operational capability needs to occur without incurring performance degradation, increasing costs, or compromising product quality. Supply chain designers have recognised the importance of sustainable supply chain flexibility (SSCF) efforts for meeting CE-targeted performance. CE-targeted performance includes reuse of materials and energy, closed flow of materials, and pollution reduction. Exploration of relationships between SSCF efforts and CE-targeted performance is limited. An objective-DEMATEL method is used to evaluate the relationship between a new SSCF measures framework and CE-targeted performance. A field study helps to identify and refine significant SSCF measures (efforts) to effectively improve CE-targeted performance. Managerial implications and future research directions for sustainable supply chain flexibility within the CE environment are presented. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Supply chain flexibility is an important operations strategy dimension for organizations to achieve and maintain competitive advantage. With rising greener customer expectations and increasingly stringent environmental regulations, green supply chains are now viewed as another competitive weapon. Green supply chains are characterized by higher complexity and turbulence. Green supply chain flexibility can aid organizations function in this complex and uncertain environment, yet investigation into this area is very limited. This paper aims contribute to this field by investigating green supply chain flexibility achievement through information systems. This paper introduces a green supply chain flexibility matrix framework. Given the large data needs, as described in the matrix, a novel probability evaluation methodology that can help predict rankings of projects and programs is introduced. The methodology extends a TOPSIS based three-parameter interval grey number (TpGN) approach by incorporating neighborhood rough set theory (RST) to evaluate IS programs’ green flexibility support capability. The results of this methodology are more objective and effective for two reasons. (1) The results are predictive rankings based on probability degree instead of the fixed deterministic ranks. (2) Neighborhood rough set theory used in this study can limit loss of information when compared to rough set theory, yet still simplify extensive data sets. This paper also identifies study limitations and future research directions for green supply chain flexibility. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Reverse logistics (or the reverse supply chain) features greater relative uncertainty when compared to forward logistics and supply chain flows. An effective way to manage uncertainty and variance in operational and organizational systems is by introducing greater flexibility. The literature on flexibility in reverse logistics is surprisingly sparse, with an explicit focus on flexibility in reverse logistics nonexistent in the literature. To address this gap in the literature, and building upon literature in supply chain flexibility, we introduce a reverse logistics flexibility framework. The framework is separated into operational and strategic flexibilities. Operational flexibility includes a variety of dimensions such as product and volume flexibility across various reverse logistics operational functions. We have also included strategic flexibility categorized into network and organizational design flexibility dimensions. Additional sub-dimensions are also included in the framework. The framework is useful for practical managerial decision making purposes such as process improvement or programmatic evaluation. The framework is also useful as a theoretical construct for reverse logistics empirical research. To exemplify the practical utility of the framework we introduce a performance evaluation of third party reverse logistics providers model using a novel neighborhood rough set approach. Using illustrative data, sensitivity results help evaluate the neighborhood rough set technique's robustness with various reverse logistics performance factors. This paper sets the foundation for significant future research in reverse logistics flexibility. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Global markets are now becoming volatile in most industries and the importance of their abilities to adapt to rapid and unexpected changes have surfaced. Modern organizations have to respond quickly to their customers' dynamic demands without compromising on quality, productivity and cost. Achieving agility lies in designing agile friendly processes and thus firms need to concentrate on their supply chains and its enablers in the attempt of redressing themselves as responsive supply chains. To evaluate and improve the levels of supply chain agility, a model called Total Agile Design System (TADS) is proposed. TADS as a methodology identifies supply chain enablers and prioritize them in order to achieve supply chain agility. In this scoring model, agility index before and after implementation of TADS are measured and discussed. The results validate the proposed model and lend evidence to the current thinking of impinging on agile concepts in traditional supply chains for competitive advantage and survival. © 2003-2012 Latin American Applied Research Journal.},

abstract={With turbulence in competition and focusing on a customer driven marketing environment, an efficient shop floor with higher productivity levels and automation alone are totally marginal to retain the desired profits. In addition, the supply chain must be flexible to respond to the quick changes happening around. This is the key to enable the firms to sustain in the market with the traditional products where it had made enormous profits. It is true that when the innovation in the product reaches saturation or becomes obsolete, the firms should concentrate on their supply chain enablers and try to make existing chains more efficient. Several methodologies to measure supply chain efficiency exist and one of those effective methods is Total Agile Design Systems (TADS) which tries to embark manufacturing concepts in supply chain. This paper attempts to apply the functions of TADS in supply chain, the prior works however enumerate the effect of TADS in production. The ultimate effects of adapting TADS in any firm are to obviously create responsive supply chains in order not to succumb to competition and frequent changes. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.},

abstract={A responsive and flexible supply chain in the global product value chain set-up links the manufacturer with various inter-company entities, such as suppliers, distributors, contract manufacturers and customers to deal with volatile demand. It is imperative and prudent to look at the overall product chain rather than focusing on any single supply chain entity. From a supply chain perspective, it is crucial that these individual entities are lean and agile (leagile) themselves, as well as the overall product value chain. As a result of the global nature of the product value chain, the concept of the decoupling point has undergone a paradigm shift. Through the literature review the authors establish three different types of decoupling point existing in product value chains, namely: (1) product structure decoupling point (PSDP), bill of materials decoupling; (2) supply structure decoupling point (SSDP), supply network decoupling; and (3) demand transfer decoupling point (DTDP), associated with information sharing. It is argued that such decoupling points are already an established and accepted phenomena, but have not been comprehensively discussed until now. It is proposed that, in the global supply chain, PSDP and SSDP are elemental decoupling points and DTDP is a logical decoupling, which is a function of PSDP and SSDP. It is proposed that DTDP swings between PSDP and SSDP and the swing direction is a critical piece of supply chain information that helps identify distortion. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) method is proposed to discover the relationship of DTDP with SSDP and PSDP using interpretation matrices and stress coefficients. Considering the supply chain as a fuzzy system, a combined effect of MDS over fuzzy applications has been used to determine the extent of swing of DTDP in the particular application of the supply chain. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In response to environmental protection policies issued by the United Nations Environment Program, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have been developed. This paper studies the short- and long-term repeated game behaviours of two parallel supply chains involving duopoly vehicle manufacturers producing BEVs and fuel vehicles (FVs). Taking consumers’ low-carbon preference and government subsidy scheme into account, optimal decisions and comparative analyses under the three game strategies of non-cooperative game and cooperative game and cost-sharing contract under supply chain coordination have been conducted. In the short-term game supply chain, three game models (non-cooperative, cooperative and cost-sharing contract) are formulated and three optimal decisions are compared. In the long-term repeated game supply chain, the dynamic behaviours of two parallel supply chains under non-cooperative game are analysed. We uncovered that the prices of BEVs are more dependent on the reduction of carbon emissions and government subsidy than FVs. In addition to supply chain coordination, consumers’ low-carbon preference also improves the total profits of the three game models. Furthermore, the adjustment speed of the eco-friendly level of BEVs has the most significant impact on the vehicle market. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Knowledge Management (KM) is a discipline that promotes an integrated approach for identifying, capturing, retrieving and sharing all of an enterprise's information assets. It is important because it stimulates innovation and growth and leads to effective decision making. Culture is a significant factor in this process and the role of people is critical. Successful Knowledge Management in any enterprise depends on the employees willing to share and invest their individual knowledge in the organization. Other factors are the business strategic priorities, top management support and technology, which may act as an enabler. We present a method for building a Knowledge Management framework utilizing Quality Function Deployment (QFD). The essence of the original QFD method was to extract the customer needs or desires expressed in his own words and to translate them into measurable product characteristics and further processing. The method has been enhanced and instead of being solely a technique for product design it became a technique for a variety of topics such as improvement of manufacturing systems, deployment of flexibility in supply chains and others. Our conceptual model has a top-down structure with QFD sequential matrices. It represents a research framework of an eventual empiric research for identifying important KM actions leading to improvement of the competitive and human advantages of an enterprise. We assume that the Knowledge Management improvement needs in an organization stem from its strategic improvement needs. To propagate the improvement needs from the strategic level to the action level, we develop two QFD matrices. The first matrix translates the strategic improvement needs into the knowledge improvement needs of an enterprise while the second one translates the knowledge improvement needs into prioritized KM improvement actions. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

However, QFD is not limited to product planning. It is a structured multi-purpose framework, which may be used to translate improvement needs of various systems into prioritized improvement activities. Consequently, the third section presents an enhanced version of this technique. The next three sections review three published applications where this framework had been utilized in different situations. One application prioritized actions for improving the implementation of an enterprise manufacturing strategy. Another application built strategy maps as improvement paths of enterprises. The third application deployed flexibility in supply chains. All these applications started at the strategic level, with the strategic improvement needs of enterprises, but their respective QFD deployment matrices were different and led to different final outputs. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={The essence of Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a product planning quality technique, is to extract the customer needs or desires, expressed in his/her own words, and then to translate them, using sequential QFD matrices, into technical product quality characteristics, planning, design, process and production. However, QFD is not limited to product planning. It is a structured multi-purpose framework, which can be used to translate improvement needs of various systems into prioritized improvement activities. The two published applications reviewed here show how this framework had been used in different contexts. One application prioritized actions for improving the implementation of an enterprise manufacturing strategy. The other application deployed flexibility in supply chains. Both applications started at the strategic level, with the strategic improvement needs of enterprises, but their respective QFD deployment matrices were different and led to different final outputs.},

abstract={This paper describes the development of flexibility through my personal views and involvement in researching this complex concept. It differentiates between two modelling perspectives: the bottom-up perspective (from the flexibility of elements to integrated flexibility) of the early researchers for modelling flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) and the more recent top-down perspective, from flexibility as a strategy to resources needed for implementing it. The bottom-up perspective is represented here by three papers. One paper focuses on Petri nets as a modelling tool, another offers a multi-factor design of experiments (DOE) view on factors affecting the performances of an FMS, and the third one presents a framework of logistic flexibility. The top-down perspective focuses on supply chain flexibility and uses quality function deployment (QFD) as a hierarchical modelling technique. An original framework for analysing the flexibility of generic objects, utilising cloud diagrams, is also presented. In all these papers a variety of changes that flexibility has to cope with are modelled, enabling the viewing of flexibility as a powerful ingredient for responding to changes and reducing risks in uncertain and changeable environments. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

Therefore, manufacturers need to become more agile and flexible, introduce personalized products and customer-oriented services, measure and capitalize environmental intangibles. To answer to those requirements, this paper addresses the key elements characterizing the urban manufacturing concept, thought as an innovative production scenario leveraging closeness to customer, customization and sustainability. Such a framework is based on innovative technologies enabling collaborative short value chains and responsive production in constrained environments, for customer-oriented products and services. The main aspects, discussed in this paper, defining the proposed production paradigm are: (1) Product customization and digitalization; (2) Sustainability; (3) Flexible and short supply chain; (4) Responsive production systems; (5) Design to manufacturing in one step; (6) Industrial symbiosis; (7) open innovation.

abstract={The use of modular plants in the chemical industry is expected to make the structure of supply chains more dynamic. The models currently used to get insight in supply chains assume a predefined supply chain structure, as orders are exogenously defined. Consequently, those models cannot grasp the dynamic nature of supply chains with modular plants. In this paper a market conceptualization based on agent-based computational economics is presented that includes transport costs in the negotiations and enables the modeling of supply chains as structures that emerge from market dynamics. It is shown that this conceptualization can capture the market dynamics that are needed to simulate a dynamic supply chain. © 2015 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.},

abstract={The adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its related technologies has transformed the manufacturing industry and has significantly changed the traditional linear manufacturing supply chains into dynamic and interconnected systems. However, the lack of an approach to assess the economic feasibility and return uncertainties of an IoT system implementation, is blamed as the culprit for hindering its adoption rate. Using two distinctive case studies, this research investigates the use of distributed simulation of agent-based model (ABM) to address such gap in the literature. The first involves the economic feasibility of an IoT implementation in a very large retail warehouse facility, while the second case study proposes a framework able to generate and assess ideal or near-ideal manufacturing configurations and capabilities, and in establishing appropriate information messaging protocols between the various system components by using ABM in distributed simulation. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={It is a common knowledge that the main goal of companies is to supply goods and services to buyers at maximum price for minimum cost. For companies such as energy producers, with complex and dynamic supply chains, this often causes cost control issues. Previously, business models based on VI (Vertical Integration) or outsourcing could mitigate cost increases, but these models have limits. A new paradigm is proposed: use of distributed ledger technology in the form of a blockchain-based supply chain integration solution. By permitting participants in a supply chain to integrate information flows in a secure, quick and automated levels of efficiency that are achieved and cannot be reached by other technologies and do not require participants to change their IT platforms. The main purpose for the creation and management of the "supply chain" is for the seller to provide the buyer the maximum value - whether of a product or service - at the lowest cost.

abstract={Future autonomous driving requires new lighting solutions. Communication in between other cars and pedestrians, which fulfills the requirements of the automotive lighting industry, is needed. A very promising lighting solution for this application are highly segmented organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Unfortunately, small area OLEDs are very sensitive to electrostatic discharge due to the small capacitance of the OLED segments. This study presents a solution for highly segmented OLEDs to fulfill automotive requirements regarding electrostatic discharge (ESD) without cost driving external components but through the improvement of the OLED itself. This solution is designed to be cheap and simple in fabrication, derived from standard photolithography to ensure no impact on existing supply chains and flexible OLED fabrication. After introducing the improved device concept for highly segmented OLEDs and its boundary conditions, a detailed view on the corresponding fabrication steps is given. The capacitive response of the protected OLED segments with respect to OLEDs without the introduced protection layer is characterized via impedance spectroscopy. The results exhibit the functionality of the ESD protection layer and prove with automotive ESD stability requirements compliance. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

abstract={The possibilities of balancing gas supply and demand with a green gas supply chain were analyzed. The considered supply chain is based on co-digestion of cow manure and maize, the produced biogas is upgraded to (Dutch) natural gas standards. The applicability of modeling yearly gas demand data in a geographical region by Fourier analysis was investigated. For a sine shape gas demand, three scenarios were further investigated: varying biogas production in time, adding gas storage to a supply chain, and adding a second digester to the supply chain which is assumed to be switched off during the summer months. A regional gas demand modeled by a sine function is reasonable for household type of users as well as for business areas, or a mixture of those. Of the considered scenarios, gas storage is by far the most expensive. When gas demand has to be met by a green gas supply chain, flexible biogas production is an interesting option. Further research in this direction might open interesting pathways to sustainable gas supply chains. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Global climate change (GCC) presents serious challenges to agricultural systems as they strive to meet increasing demand over the coming decades. Within these systems, food value chains are increasingly recognised as being vital for development, yet relatively little is known about the vulnerability of such chains to GCC, or their capacity to adapt. This paper provides a framework to examine how food value chains are affected by the uncertain impacts posed by GCC and what this implies for adaptation. While intervention models mostly deal with measures for producers, the authors hypothesise that adaptation strategies must include the entire chain to achieve the scale needed to tackle GCC. The authors propose that comprehensive situation assessment is necessary to examine both behaviour and assets—two key attributes for adaptive capacities. This framework examines three sets of attributes: (1) The general setup and nature of the supply chain; (2) rural livelihoods’ and food supply systems’ vulnerability to GCC, including downscaled crop suitability modelling to assess precise impacts of GCC, and (3) the behaviour of people and entities involved in value creation and the institutions mediating them. The framework provides decision-makers with a scale, crop and site independent road map to design and evaluate adaptation strategies to changing climate conditions. The authors test the framework in three case studies with differing supply chain characteristics and geographical contexts. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Demand for the products are assumed to be time–varying. In case of a stock–out for one of the products, its demand is satisfied by using the stock of the other product.

abstract={This paper shows that operational flexibility interacting with informational uncertainty may lead to truthful information exchange in equilibrium even when the communication is nonbinding and unverifiable, i.e., "cheap talk." We consider a model consisting of a manufacturer releasing a new product with uncertain release date and demand, and a retailer who must determine the allocation of limited capacity between a preexisting third-party product and the manufacturer's new product that may or may not be released on time. The manufacturer has a private forecast about the likelihood of the product release and/or about the demand, which he shares (either truthfully or not) with the retailer. We show that under the "traditional" supply chain structure (one-time opportunity to order) no truthful equilibrium can emerge. However, if (1) the supply chain structure allows for postponement, i.e., the ability to delay orders at a certain cost by the retailer, and (2) the manufacturer has informational uncertainty about the retailer's capacity, then truthful information exchange may emerge in equilibrium, where the manufacturer transmits his true forecast and the retailer treats the transmission as truthful. The genesis of this effect is preference reversal, where the manufacturer is not sure which way to distort the forecast to best motivate the retailer to wait for the new product. Thus, we show that a truth-revealing mechanism can emerge from a relatively rich setup featuring two-sided information asymmetry interacting with postponement. © 2018 INFORMS.},

Financial incentives for environmental, social, and governance criteria further motivate mitigation action by firms. To achieve sustainable outcomes, human and ecological systems must be managed for resilience. The scientific community and food and beverage firms must collaborate in the development of measurable and verifiable indicators that support adaptation and mitigation action along food supply chains. This article identifies 3 areas in which a synergistic progress would set a resilient trajectory toward sustainability: 1) incentives for sustainable intensification, 2) expanded reporting standards, and 3) pre-competitive collaborations.

abstract={Data-driven innovations (DDI) have significantly impacted firms’ operations thanks to the massive exploitation of huge data. However, to leverage big data and achieve supply chain innovation, a variety of complementary resources are necessary. In this study, we hypothesise that supply chain innovation (SCI) is dependent on firms’ big data analytics capabilities (BAC). Furthermore, we propose that this relation is mediated by two crucial capabilities of agility and adaptability that enable firms to efficiently meet the challenges of supply chain ambidexterity. Finally, we also test the moderating role of technology uncertainty in our research model. We collected data from 386 manufacturing firms in Pakistan and tested our model using structural equation modelling. The results confirmed our initial hypotheses that agility and adaptability both mediated our baseline relationship of BAC and big data innovation in supply chains. We further found support for the moderating role of technology uncertainty. Furthermore, technology uncertainty moderates the relationship between BAC and SCI. This study extends the current literature on digital analytics capabilities and innovation along the supply chain. Practically, our research suggests that investment in big data can result in affirmative consequences, if firms cultivate capabilities to encounter supply chain ambidexterity through agility and adaptability. Accordingly, we suggest that managers belonging to manufacturing firms need to build up these internal capabilities and to monitor and assess technology uncertainty in the environment. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Supply chain flexibility has gained importance in recent years because of competitive factors in the enterprises. This chapter explores the concept of supply chain flexibility along five perspectives. The first perception considers supply chain flexibility as an extension of manufacturing flexibility, while the second perception considers flexibility in relation to product complexity within the supply chain. The third notion of supply chain flexibility considers it as an extension of flexibility of individual nodes in the supply chain. The fourth perception of flexibility views the flexibility within supply chain in terms of the flexibility of choosing and managing the structural relationships. Finally, the fifth perception of supply chain flexibility considers it as a performance metric in the supply chain. The literature related to these perceptions of flexibility is collated to highlight the need of development of an integrated framework to exploit the supply chain flexibility for improving the supply chain performance. © Springer India 2014.},

abstract={We consider a supply chain with one supplier and one retailer in which the parties develop a quantity flexibility contract to specify the conditions of procurement activities. The contract allows the retailer to adjust the initial order quantity after the partial or full resolution of demand uncertainty, which helps the retailer reduce supply–demand mismatches. We use the multiplicative martingale model of forecast evolution to analyze the impact of lead-time reduction on the value of quantity flexibility for the retailer. We find that the shorter the lead time, the higher the value of quantity flexibility. Quantity flexibility may, however, also cause supply chain disintermediation problems for the retailer, such as the supplier bypassing the retailer and selling its products directly to end customers. We incorporate the “contracts as reference points” theory into our quantity flexibility contract model to capture the impact of supply chain disintermediation on the retailer's profit. This approach allows us to analyze the trade-off between decreasing supply–demand mismatches and increasing supply chain disintermediation problems. We show that the impact of lead-time reduction on decreasing the disintermediation risk highly depends on the critical fractile. We also find that the supplier's cost structure has a significant effect on the trade-off. When the supplier's initial investment cost is relatively low, the disintermediation problems become less important. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to assess supply chain reconfigurability in a global scenario. The paper attempts to measure comprehensive relative reconfigurability index (CRRI) in an automobile case supply chain by holistically considering fifteen enablers of reconfigurability. The present research evaluates CRRI by utilizing two distinct assessment models that calculate relative reconfigurability index (RRI). Firstly, a deterministic assessment model is developed from the total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) digraph, and secondly, an integrated assessment methodology that utilizes both the Delphi technique and the additive weighting method to calculate RRI. The uniqueness of the present research is to quantify reconfigurability in the case supply chain by a numerical index termed as CRRI. The paper analyzes the level of reconfigurability competence of the case supply chain in comparison with an ideal supply chain and thus facilitates structural flexibility. The proposed model for calculating CRRI, using two methodologies and comparing the results, is an innovative way of measuring supply chain reconfigurability. Supply chain's preparedness to structurally change in the present business environment of uncertainty and turbulence can be evaluated and it would act as an aide in decision making pertaining to reconfigurability in supply chains. © 2019},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify, analyze, and categorize the major enablers of reconfigurability that can facilitate structural changes within a supply chain in a global scenario. The paper also addresses five reconfigurability dimensions in the perspective of supply chains and the major enablers to attain them. The paper further aims to understand the mutual interactions among these enablers through the identification of hierarchical relationships among them. Design/methodology/approach: A framework that holistically considers all the major enablers of reconfigurability has been developed. The hierarchical interrelationships between major enablers have been presented and interpreted using a novel qualitative modeling technique, i.e., total interpretive structural modeling (TISM), which is an extension of ISM. SPSS 22.0 is employed to carry out a one-tailed one-sample t-test further to test the hypotheses for validating the results of TISM. Impact matrix cross-reference multiplication applied to a classification (MICMAC) analysis has been employed to identify the driving and dependence powers of these reconfigurability enablers. Findings: In this paper, 15 enablers for reconfigurability paradigm have been identified through literature review and expert opinions. The authors established interrelationships and interdependencies among these enablers and categorized them as enablers of each dimension. New product development and customer satisfaction come at the highest level of priority. The levels of these enablers were obtained using TISM. The authors compared the results with the clusters derived from MICMAC analysis, and the results are found to be well within the acceptable range. Research limitations/implications: The study has implications for both practitioners and academia. The work provides a comprehensive list of enablers that are relevant to reconfigure supply chains in today’s volatile global market. This research will also help decision makers to strategically focus on the top-level enablers and their concerned dimensions. The research is based on an automobile company case study and can be extended to products with volatile and changing demands. Originality/value: The proposed model for reconfigurability enablers using TISM is a new effort altogether in the area of supply chain management. The novelty of this research lies in its identification of specific enablers to reconfigure a supply chain through different dimensions. © 2017, 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Supply chain flexibility has become an important ingredient to remain competitive in today's increasingly complex business environment. Within this context, drawing from the knowledge-based view of the firm, we investigate the influence of internal and external knowledge transfer activities on supply chain flexibility. In addition, taking a contingency perspective, we hypothesize about the moderating effects of product and supply complexity on the relationships between knowledge transfer and supply chain flexibility. We test our hypotheses with data collected from procurement and supply chain professionals in Germany. Pursuant to our expectations, we find a positive and significant influence of internal and external knowledge transfer on supply chain flexibility. We further confirm a negative moderating effect of supply complexity on the relationship between internal knowledge transfer and supply chain flexibility, and a negative moderating effect of product complexity on the relationship between external knowledge transfer and supply chain flexibility. However, contrary to our expectations, we find significant positive effects for the remaining two moderations, being indicative of the unique dynamics emanating from complexity, able to yield both negative and positive moderation effects contingent on the situation. Overall, these findings provide important insight into the value of knowledge transfer activities for supply chain flexibility, and especially into when knowledge transfer is most effective, drawing attention to influential complexity contingencies.

Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory study includes three industry case studies, triangulated with external observers. A total of 11 semi-structured interviews were conducted within Germany and the UK. Findings: Findings demonstrate that in order to adopt the see-now-buy-now model there is a need for process-shortening, as well as better process and network alignment between MBFR and brands through agility, supplier–relationship management and vertical integration in order to stay competitive against time-based competition. Whilst most steps of the traditional BMSCP are still applicable under the see-now-buy-now model, they must be re-engineered and shortened, with the steps being rolling rather than linear, with buyers and merchandisers operating in a more hybrid role.

abstract={In this paper, we develop a four-stage procedure for evaluating and improving a supplier’s volume flexibility. In the first stage, we use historical demand data to develop a model for forecasting their future quantities. In the next stage, we develop an algorithm for smoothing the forecasted future demands. We show that applying this algorithm not only reduces production fluctuations and damages, but also improves the flexibility of the supplier and hence the overall supply chain. We investigate the economical conditions of applying this algorithm. In the third stage, by considering the forecasted future demands, we develop a mathematical single-period flexibility measure. In the fourth stage, the developed measure is extended to a multi-period model for applying in the multi-period supply collaborations and especially in the VMI systems. Furthermore, we consider weight coefficients for taking into account the different importance of flexibility from the buyer’s perspective over the time horizon. By applying in a real case study about an oil refinery, we verify the developed model and investigate the effects of its parameters through the sensitivity analysis. © 2018, © 2018 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers.},

abstract={This paper presents an integrated, auto-reconfigurable power-supply network to enhance system lifetime and efficiency in self-reliant energy-harvesting applications. Carbon nanotube (CNT) supercapacitors are employed as both energy storage devices and power sources, thereby achieving multidirectional energy exchange. By leveraging advanced semiconductor processes, a low-volume, cost-effective single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) power management unit (PMU) is developed, which connects all the supercapacitors into an autonomous power-supply network. The PMU enables reversible power flows, shorter power-delivery paths, and effective energy reutilization, which enhances the reliability and flexibility of the system. The use of CNT supercapacitors features small form factor and high energy/power density, making them highly attractive for power-constrained devices. A prototype of the PMU is fabricated with a 0.35-μm N-well CMOS process, with a chip area of approximately 4.3mm2. The PMU interconnects 3-CNT supercapacitors in the power-supply network, and operates from 1.5 to 3 V. The measured peak energy-transfer efficiency is 85.03%. The supercapacitors deliver an energy density of 6.2 Wh/kg, at a high power density of 79 kW/kg and exhibit excellent stability of 98.5% retention, at a current density of 50 A/g. © 2016 IEEE.},

Under circumstances of strong price pressure, there is demand for standardized TPL services offering simplicity, minimalism and functionality based on digitalization, e-commerce and servitization. Alternatively, with market developments responsive to supply chain complexity, digitalization, e-commerce and servitization enable development towards innovation and change. We conclude that these developments do not invalidate existing frameworks for TPL strategies but contribute alternative strategies. We formulate three propositions for each strategic path. To avoid being stuck in the middle, TPLs are encouraged to either develop efficient services through servitized logistics chains and digital solutions or develop advanced solutions to integrate the consumer into the logistics network system through competencies to control increased levels of complexity. © 2021},

abstract={This report focuses on the area of Green Supply Chain. The purpose is to investigate which main barriers that firms and supply chains encounter in their work towards an environmentally responsive supply chain. The articles were used to find connections and similarities to get a result and draw conclusions. The result is divided into two main headings: Internal and external barriers. The primary internal barriers are resources and technical issues. The barrier that consists of resources is divided into financial resources and resources in the form of competence. The primary external barriers are suppliers, regulations, and competitiveness, and consumers. Finally, a conclusion was made that there is a possibility for companies to change potential barriers to drivers and enhance their competitive advantage while having a sustainable supply chain. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={Purpose: The emergence of new digital technologies in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution presents a turning point that could change the fate of the traditional ways of designing, build and manage asset data. Disruptive technologies such as Blockchain and theInternet of things (IoT) are one of the main pillars that are driving this revolution. The integration of decentralised networks and automated workflows has the potential to become a pivotal factor in construction projects, especially in supply chain ecosystems within the off-site manufacturing field. Obstacles related to fragmented information, interoperability, transparency and “big data” management are the main drivers for change that the industry needs to address. Whilst organisations and users can automate workflows and processes by utilising IoT technology to transfer data without human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction, the interaction, storage and management of the data generated are not safe or reliable. Design/methodology/approach: The approach outlined in this paper addresses the challenges that IoT and centralised networks present. Blockchain, a peer-to-peer distributed database, offers the possibility to support and maintain the asset information without interruptions in all the stages of the life cycle. The synergy between these technologies, along with other techniques, methods and platforms (such as building information modeling (BIM)), based on a single environment, will support information traceability from the strategic definition to end of life. Findings: The framework of this study presents an excellent opportunity to apply new workflows and processes with the application of new technologies and protocols. It benefits from a well-established platform such as BIM to enable the coordination and management of digital assets as well as giving illustration and collaboration to the supply chain members. IoT and Blockchain are the other layers that work together with the third layer (BIM). This framework proposed the use of these platforms to ensure the information traceability of physical and digital assets, data automation and information management, in a dynamic supply chain ecosystem, bringing efficiency and transparency to stakeholders and users. Practical implications: This study provides an exploratory framework to be used by the supply chain members in offsite manufacturing, and the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry in general, to track asset information throughout their entire life cycle securely and transparently. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the knowledge of IoT, Blockchain technology and BIM use in offsite manufacturing under the AEC industry. It provides a basis for future research by professionals, experts and academics regarding these technologies and their workflows. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Flexibility is a crucial performance indicator for supply chains, since it allows for a fast adaption to changing customer demands and environments. This is especially true for food chains, due to the direct interdependence between shelf life and quality of the product, and environmental factors, such as seasonal demand and temperature maintenance. Autonomous cooperation of logistic entities is considered as a concept to foster flexibility in supply chains. One realization of autonomous cooperation is the intelligent container, which is able to constantly monitor storage conditions like temperature and relative humidity of the cargo, while exchanging transport information with its environment and communicating with the freight owner. Hence, the question arises, how the intelligent container may enhance the flexibility of food chains. Therefore, the paper examines contributions and limitations of the intelligent container regarding the flexibility of a specific kind of food chain, namely the banana supply chain. © Springer India 2014.},

This research explores the need for healthcare supply chains to be more adaptable and flexible. A literature informed design science approach was adopted as the methodology. We propose a systems view of an adaptive and flexible healthcare supply chain. Furthermore, we build system dynamic models to illustrate an unhealthy healthcare supply chain and a healthy healthcare supply chain.

abstract={Aside from becoming more complex and dynamic, manufacturing supply chains must be capable in adapting to disruptive events caused by natural and man-made disasters. Risk analysis aids in developing mitigation policies to achieve a resilient manufacturing supply chain. However, the uncertainty and vagueness of information along the supply chain pose a challenge to risk analysis. Previous approaches on the analysis of supply chain risks have been proposed but have drawbacks that may provide counterintuitive results. Thus, this study attempts to develop a methodological approach based on supply-driven input-output analysis with fuzzy parameters in order to address supply chain risk analysis. The motivation behind the adoption of such approach lies in the strength of I-O analysis in addressing interdependent systems and its ability to address uncertainty of information shared among members. The proposed approach was applied to an herbal manufacturing supply chain to illustrate the methodology. © 2017 Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME)},

abstract={Coordination in a supply chains may require investment in relationship-specific assets (RSA) including information systems and human resources from all or a subset of the partners. These investments are typically partially non-verifiable, possibly based on internal resources or opportunity costs. A supplier offers a single-price single-period contract to a downstream manufacturer who accepts or turns to a non-strategic outside option. Both parties invest in relationship-specific assets (RSA) accordingly. Using a game theoretic framework of repeated single-period bargaining under asymmetric information and outside options, we show how a supplier may behave opportunistically. We show how this rent extraction threat is mitigated when the manufacturer mis-informs the supplier or hides information from her. As a result of both behaviors, our model explains how supply chain coordination and efficiency are impaired. On a normative basis, we provide the manufacturer with new justifications for both dual sourcing and distorting information. Numerical examples illustrate the results. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The fashion industry is a highly globalized industry increasingly dominated by international firms that favour flexible, efficient supply chains in order to produce trendy clothing at the lowest price. While much of the fashion industry follows the logics of global production networks, this paper presents a case where small, independent firms have chosen instead to engage with local production networks. Drawing on interviews with 87 independent fashion designers and key informants, this paper examines the following question: In the context of global production, why do independent fashion designers choose to work locally? In answering this question, three key findings are presented: the motivations of designers who emphasize timeless design and high-quality local manufacturing; the strategies employed by designers to cultivate exclusivity and loyalty through the distribution of their collections; and the ways in which unique consumption experiences are utilized to articulate the values of their brand to consumers. While operating outside of the traditional fashion system provides independent fashion designers with the space for creativity, innovation, and control over their brand, it will be argued it also creates challenges with respect to growth beyond their niche market. © 2017 Canadian Association of Geographers / L'Association canadienne des géographes},

abstract={Balancing sustainability and disruption of supply chains requires organizational ambidexterity. Sustainable supply chains prioritize efficiency and economies of scale and may not have sufficient redundancy to withstand disruptive events. There is a developing body of literature that attempts to reconcile these two aspects. This study gives a data-driven literature review of sustainable supply chain management trends toward ambidexterity and disruption. The critical review reveals temporal trends and geographic distribution of literature. A hybrid of data-driven analysis approach based on content and bibliometric analyses, fuzzy Delphi method, entropy weight method, and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is used on 273 keywords and 22 indicators obtained based on the experts’ evaluation. The most important indicators are identified as supply chain agility, supply chain coordination, supply chain finance, supply chain flexibility, supply chain resilience, and sustainability. The regions show different tendencies compared with others. Asia and Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa are the regions needs improvement, while Europe and North America show distinct apprehensions on supply chain network design. The main contribution of this review is the identification of the knowledge frontier, which then leads to a discussion of prospects for future studies and practical industry implementation. © 2020},

abstract={This paper investigates whether a supply chain can achieve coordination by implementing two mechanisms: a cooperative advertising program and a price discount mechanism. We start by analyzing a consignment contract with a revenue-sharing agreement in which a manufacturer decides both the price and the quality investment while the retailer sets the store advertising efforts. The manufacturer is the brand owner and increases the goodwill through quality and pricing. We solve three dynamic games, in which the manufacturer is the Stackelberg leader, and compare the related solutions. We discover that the manufacturer, as chain leader, will always propose the adoption of a coordination mechanism. When the manufacturer opts for a cooperative program, the retailer is always economically better off; thus, a cooperative program is always profit-Pareto-improving. When the manufacturer opts for a price discount mechanism, the retailer is always economically worse-off because the discount applies only to her margins. Nevertheless, the price discount mechanism is profit-Pareto-improving in the case of high production cost: The price discount allows for considerably reducing the retail price, which translates to a substantial increase in demand. In all other cases, the retailer sets zero price discount, thus preferring a non-coordinated framework. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A scoping review of the literature relating to the development of a production network maturity mapping framework for advanced manufacturing technology capabilities: The case for cemented tungsten carbides. Cemented tungsten carbide possesses diamond-like hardness and excellent heat resistance, making it an ideal candidate for a wide range of cutting and drilling applications. The successful adoption of additive manufacturing within the realm of cemented tungsten carbides could streamline the production process and be highly beneficial within multiple industries. However, a wide range of capabilities and innovation capacities are required to support the development and adoption of such innovations. Design problems, cost implications, human resource requirements and supply network adaptions must all be considered, as well as their possible influence on supporting technologies. A scoping review is done to identify literature most relevant to the research topic. The review attempts to provide a systematic approach and structure to the analysis of the literature in order to increase the repeatability of such a study while decreasing the variability associated with such a study. The logic behind the review steps is explained to substantiate the relevance of the chosen literature. In this review certain pre-determined research questions are answered. The topics of maturity models and hardmetal 3D printing technologies are addressed, and the fusion of these topics is explored. This exploration led to the identification of a gap within the literature of maturity frameworks for 3D printed cemented tungsten carbide.

abstract={Based on transaction cost analysis (TCA), resource dependency theory (RDT), and supply chain management literature, this study explores the effect of buyer-specific monitoring procedures on buyer control in industrial buyer-seller transactions, particularly in relation to how environmental uncertainty affects the buying firm's ability to exercise control over the supplier firm. The research design is based on primary data from a survey of 168 industrial buyer-seller relationships which map a broad set of dimensions of the economic transactions and structures in these business-to-business relationships. The empirical findings provide support for the hypotheses, and demonstrate that the effect of the buyer-specific monitoring procedures is positively associated with buyer control arrangements under conditions with rather modest external disturbances. This governance pattern is completely changed when business relationships face substantial environmental uncertainty. Under such conditions, the effect of buyer specific monitoring procedures on buyer control is significantly attenuated. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Consequently, supply chain integration (SCI) strategies should also be evaluated under the conditions a firm is facing. This paper examines the determinants of range of supply chain integration. By comparing the SCI strategies of Korean and Japanese steel firms, the paper shows that SCI should be evaluated in light of supply chain flexibility and uncertainty. Additionally, it is argued that although SCI with customers helps diminish demand uncertainty, it can also bring inflexibility, which is a customer 'lock-in' phenomenon.

abstract={Purpose - The aeronautical industry is a perfect example of a complex product industry characterized by a hierarchically-organized supply chain. The authors can identify four types of supplier interfaces: Interactive, translation, specified and standardized ones. The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors explaining the diversification of these relationships between aircraft manufacturers and their suppliers, through the example of Airbus suppliers. Design/methodology/approach - Network analysis (to define the complexity level of aircraft components), data analysis (to characterize the diversity of aircraft suppliers) and a logit model were combined in order to link the supplier interfaces to the complexity of components and to the suppliers' characteristics. Findings - It is shown that the earlier a supplier is involved in the development process, the more responsibility is delegated to him and the more intertwined its relationship is with the prime contractor. Also, it is shown that component complexity plays a major role in a supplier's involvement during the integral design and face-to-face interactions matter greatly during the co-design phases of the products. Research limitations/implications - The research has rather a static perspective covering all the inter-firm relations within Airbus programs at once. By using the same databases, one could look into the evolution of supplier interfaces within the aeronautical supply chain. A dynamic view would provide some evidence regarding the recent restructuring of the supply chain. Originality/value - The originality of the paper comes from the methodology and the use of original data allowing to test in the same analysis the role of the component complexity and the characterization of the suppliers on the form of relationship between the manufacturer and its principal suppliers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

With the purpose of contributing to the discussion about the role of near sourcing in current dynamic SCs, the present work analyses the case of an Italian retailer that turned the global store furniture procurement process into near sourcing. Switching from Far East suppliers to a continental one enables a SC reengineering that decreases transportation and inventory carrying costs and assures economic viability.

abstract={This paper studies lead time flexibility in a two-stage continuous review supply chain in which the retailer uses the (R, Q) inventory system: when his inventory position reaches R, the retailer places orders with size Q to the manufacturer, who uses a transportation provider to deliver them with different lead time options. According to the contract, the manufacturer is able to expedite or postpone the delivery if the retailer makes such a request. Hence, the retailer has the flexibility to modify the lead time by using the most up-to-date demand information. The optimal lead time policy is found to be a threshold-type policy. The sensitivity analysis also shows that R is much more sensitive to the change of lead time than Q, and thus, the paper is primarily focused on finding optimal R. We also provide a cost approximation which yields unimodal cost in R. Furthermore, we analyze the order crossing problem and derive an upper bound for the probability of order crossing. Finally, we conduct an extensive sensitivity analysis to illustrate the effects of lead time flexibility on supply chain performance and discuss the managerial insights. © 2017 The Operational Research Society.},

abstract={The technological progress has opened new scenarios in terms of manufacturing paradigms. In particular, the world of Internet has allowed to connect resources characterized by a different geographical position independently of the distance. Among the interesting technologies that are able to exploit these advantages are certainty the Additive Manufacturing and the reverse engineering systems. The main paradigm that based its strengths in the aspects before mentioned is named Cloud. In particular, it represents a paradigm that allows to supply resources of different kind to catch up a certain goal. The most famous application of the Cloud paradigm is the Cloud Computing but, thanks to the new manufacturing technologies the application of this concept for the production has gained more importance. In this case the correct term to indicate the application of the Cloud paradigm to the production is Cloud Manufacturing. This last term describes as, thanks to the resources linked through the web, it is possible to define a supply chain that allows to obtain the production of products in an innovative manner. The innovation of this paradigm is the possibility to configure a supply chain characterized by: flexibility, availability of a tool for support decisional system, "on demand" production and manufacturing capabilities considered as services. This paper reports an innovative application of the Cloud Manufacturing paradigm that has expected the definition a tool web-based that allows to configure the client requests and the relative supply chain considering the best available solutions. In particular, the developed system, called AMSA (Additive Manufacturing Spare parts market Application) have had as main goal the definition of a common platform to supply different kind of services: product development oriented to the Additive Manufacturing (DFAM, Design For Additive Manufacturing), production of prototype or small series with Additive Manufacturing and reverse engineering activities to obtain CAD models starting from a physical object. The definition of different kind of services allow to satisfy several client needs such as: necessity to define an innovative product characterized by high performance in terms of stiffness/weight ratio, possibility to manufacture small series, such as in the motorsport field, and possibility to define CAD models for the obsolete parts for which the geometrical information are missed. AMSA platform relies on the reconfigurable supply chain that is dynamic and it depends on the particular client needs. For example, when the client requires the manufacture of a small series of a particular component, AMSA allows to the technicians to choose the best solutions in terms of price and distance. Therefore, the suppliers that contribute to the definition of the dynamic supply chain have an important role. The AMSA platform, for these reasons, represents an important tool able to link the suppliers to the customers in the best manner in order to obtain service that are characterized an high performance level. © 2019 Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: The aim of this study is to identify and analyse the main strategic differences between fast and ultra-fast fashion supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative approach, using document analysis and in-depth interviews with industry specialists. Findings: Ultra-fast fashion differs from fast in the following supply chain strategies: avoids any excess inventory, focuses on local manufacturing, on-demand production, and shorter lead times from a few days to a week with a combination of agile, lean, responsive supply chain strategies. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this research are due to the cut-off period and the use of a restricted sample. As implications, technological capabilities are underexplored in the fashion industry. Although important to the traditional and fast fashion industry, technology is viewed as a tool and not as a capability that can generate competitive advantage. This paper addresses technology as capabilities to make ultra-fast fashion retailers more competitive. Practical implications: Ultra-fast fashion could potentially impact current fast fashion retailers to partially move their business model and operations towards an ultra-fast approach. Fast fashion retailers desiring to speed up their production processes launch more weekly collections to cater to consumers who are more fashion-conscious. Originality/value: There is a rapid emergence of new start-ups that are calling themselves ultra-fast. Newcomers wanting to adopt this new segment’s business model, develop technological capabilities to meet the challenges of this supercompetitive market. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: In spite of its potential benefits in a wide range of situations, supply chain risk mitigation strategies have received scant attention on the subject of managing the supply chain risk in the business environment. Especially, there is still a limited understanding of the importance of firms’ supply chain flexibility, resilience and responsiveness in the supply chain risk management (SCRM) literature. This research focuses on exploring the relationship between significant proactive risk mitigation strategies, namely supply chain (SC) flexibility, resilience and responsiveness, as well as SCRM performance to facilitate bridging the gap between mitigation strategies and SCRM performance. The moderating role of risk management (RM) culture was also hypothesized and tested. Design/methodology/approach: A survey-based methodology is adopted. The data are analyzed using the technique of partial least squares. Findings: The results indicate that SC resilience and responsiveness are positively associated with SCRM performance; however, SC flexibility does not. In addition, interestingly, RM culture does not moderate these relationships in spite of the extant literature. We argue that this could be due to the fact that risk management culture is at the beginning stage for an enterprise in Turkey. Originality/value: This study extends the existing literature by advancing the knowledge on the relationship between proactive risk management strategies, which applied to overcome uncertainties and SCRM performance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Increasing the understanding of the management of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) is fundamental to accelerate the much-desired transition towards the circular economy. From this perspective, we investigate the value of proportional order-up-to policies (POUT) policies and the adjustment of their inventory controllers in these systems. These policies are often used to improve the performance of traditional supply chains due to their ability to cope with the damaging bullwhip effect; however, they have not been sufficiently studied in CLSCs. Through a difference equation modelling approach, we show that POUT policies are also a valuable instrument for enhancing the CLSC dynamics. Specifically, we find that the POUT model outperforms the traditional order-up-to policy in a hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system, yielding significant cost savings. To optimise the key trade-off between order and inventory variability, the tuning of the inventory controllers needs to consider not only the cost structure of the CLSC but also the average return rate. Specifically, managers should react to increasing levels of circularity by lowering the setting of the controllers’ time constant. In the light of our findings, we suggest two strategies for aligning the calibration of the POUT controllers and the forecasting methods to increase the economic performance of CLSCs. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Lean management and resilience are studied as significant paradigms in the supply chain in unaggregated domain. As studied in the literature, the resiliency can contribute to the flexibility of supply chains for fulfilling the fluctuations by enabling redundancy. However, the level of redundancy can be an interesting topic from lean management perspective to be managed. This paper has focused on the context of aggregation of Lean and resiliency management these and has proposed a trade-off matrix method. The integration and aggregation of lean and resilient supply chain (SC) practices are investigated with a special focus for creation of synergy. The paper also has investigated the impact of this integration on SC performance through a case study in context of the COVID-19 ventilator production. This case has been designed to highlight the tradeoff analysis among lean and resilience concepts. By applying an Analytic Hierarchy Process model, the paper has enabled a decision-making framework for determination of redundancy level. The data collection for including and documentation of information about various sections of the supply chain is conducted to determine the optimal solution by service level evaluation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to discuss the implications of COVID-19 on container import flows via the US port distribution system. We employ statistics collected for more than 21 US ports and for more than 550,000 container shipments by Walmart and Nike to identify trends and potential shifts in the US port distribution system. Results unveil different changes in distribution channels during the pandemic era, between aggregated port level and industry level. These differences are specific to firms and could be explained by the origin of flows, carrier selection to transport cargos and US port/inland distribution systems. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the different role played by ports for industries (retailers, footwear and apparel) and shows that the ability to adapt supply chains to a major disruption remains subject to the initial choices on the location of production, on carrier choices and on port/inland distribution networks. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Because firms do not operate in isolation, they are bound by the structure of the networks in which they are embedded. This structure has implications on a firm's ability to access resources and utilize them to their advantage. We consider two critical components of this network structure: network power and network cohesion. Both of these network structures can be critical determinants of firm financial success. Yet, to date the extant research has not yet considered the role of network relations in the context of Supply Chain Finance (SCF). This manuscript attempts to contribute to this gap. Through the use of a dynamic supply chain network structure, we test the role that network power and cohesion have on a firm's financial performance. The results indicate network cohesion contributes positively to efficiency in financial performance, whereas power is a critical factor in earnings performance. Taken together, the study advances a nuanced perspective of managing the firm's levels of network power and cohesion to allow for heightened financial performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The Covid-19 pandemic lead Italy to undertake a severe lockdown for almost two months. All of a sudden, the lives of Italians were forced to shift in accordance with the regulations issued by government. This change in the lives of Italians can be mirrored by an adjustment in food consumer behaviour that, consequently, brought about a transition in the whole supply chain. This paper gives an overview of the recent changes in consumption patterns that occurred due to the Italian lockdown, and how evolutions in behaviour are intertwined with the evolution of the main food supply chains. Many of the events here depicted are likely to last far beyond the crisis and affect the subsequent evolution of food consumption in Italy. The Italian retail supply chain successfully adapted to the big shift in consumption. Despite purchases for essential items having increased, no stockout harmed the food security of Italians. Out-of-home consumption moved inside houses giving space to home meal preparation and comfort food. Home delivery has been the most important element in this context, as it boomed during this period, helping laggard consumers fill the digital divide, as it was mostly mediated by e-commerce platforms and instant messaging. It was also the leverage that allowed small retailers and small producers regain their space. This crisis calls for a more sustainable food system that will be increasingly oriented to moving goods rather than people, which will also have relevance in the coming years. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={At the time of instability becomes the norm (climate changes, natural disasters, epidemic, etc.) the management of collaborative networks, such as supply chains, is becoming more and more complex and critical. This instability only adds to the complexity of an already very complex system. Thus, supply chain managers have to adapt to multi-dimensional complex situations. Dealing with instability is a key expectation for these managers. One tool to help managers make decisions in this unstable environment is simulation. This article introduces some first results on an “atomic” reconfigurable supply chain simulation model based on Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model. This simulation tool will be used to apply an innovative physics-based approach of risk and opportunity management, that designs disturbances by forces moving the considered supply chain within its performance framework. This approach enables managers to monitor supply chain’s performance trajectory by viewing and merging the impact of risks and opportunities. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Supply chain management has become more important as an academic topic due to trends in globalization leading to massive reallocation of production related advantages. Because of the massive amount of data that is generated in the global economy, new tools need to be developed in order to manage and analyze the data, as well as to monitor organizational performance worldwide. This paper proposes a framework of business analytics for supply chain analytics (SCA) as IT-enabled, analytical dynamic capabilities composed of data management capability, analytical supply chain process capability, and supply chain performance management capability. This paper also presents a dynamic-capabilities view of SCA and extensively describes a set of its three capabilities: data management capability, analytical supply chain process capability, and supply chain performance management capability. Next, using the SCM best practice, sales & operations planning (S&OP), the paper demonstrates opportunities to apply SCA in an integrated way. In discussing the implications of the proposed framework, finally, the paper examines several propositions predicting the positive impact of SCA and its individual capability on SCM performance. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Many empirical studies based upon RBV have investigated OM functions/capabilities and their impacts on business performance. Despite the considerable amount of research that has been conducted, there is no meta-analysis of application of RBV in the OM field. Hitt et al. (2016) reviewed the use and application of RBV in OM, based upon studies published in nine elite OM journals in the period 2007–2013. We take a meta-analytic approach to statistically combine and critically analyse application of RBV in OM over the period 2007–2020. We identify three primary operational functions/capabilities, namely flexibility, supply chain integration, and organizational capability, that have a positive impact on business performance in general, and on competitive performance, financial performance, and operational performance in particular.

abstract={Responsiveness to customers and markets is an indispensable requirement for all industries, particularly the fashion industry. The present study attempts to address this issue by employing a resource-based perspective as a lens for exploring the major antecedents and consequences of supply chain agility at both the strategic and operational levels. Drawing on a review of the extant literature, we argue that two organizational flexibility factors – strategic flexibility and manufacturing flexibility – are the critical antecedents to supply chain agility. In addition, supply chain agility, strategic flexibility, and manufacturing flexibility are all significant factors in firm performance. A conceptual framework for the arguments was developed and tested through an empirical study of selected industrial practitioners. Data from a sample of 141 garment manufacturers were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results reveal that both strategic flexibility and manufacturing flexibility positively influence supply chain agility. However, strategic flexibility has a direct and significant influence on firm performance while manufacturing flexibility does not. Furthermore, supply chain agility plays an important role in mediating the effects of both strategic and manufacturing flexibilities on firm performance. The findings of the present study add to the understanding of supply chain management, with a focus on supply chain agility in the fashion manufacturing industry. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Due to rapid globalization, an introduction of Goods and Services Taxes (GST), ban on BS-III vehicles, and rapid technological advancement creates new dimensions for the automobile industry in India especially for those who come in the category of small and medium enterprise (SMEs).In the current changing scenario victorious execution of supply chain management (SCM) practices can provide competitive leverage to Automobile manufacturers over their rivals particularly those who are poorly implemented supply chain management practices. This paper takes two main SCM practices, i.e. supply chain flexibility (SCF) and supply chain strategy (SCS).Against this background, this paper acknowledged 5 success factors (SFs) for supply chain flexibility and 3 success factors (SFs) for supply chain strategy for proper implementation of SCM practices in the Automobile industry, and studied their impact on three factors of supply chain performance (SCP), and thereby on firms performance. The top management of any industry is focused on their core strength with commitment, long-term vision and provides resources for supply chain, and thereby developing effective and efficient SCS emerged as the most significant SFs. To measure the impact on supply chain performance, the author carefully measures different SFs of SCS related to customer-oriented strategy, innovation strategy and agile supply chain strategy on cost performance, logistics performance and customer satisfaction performance. Similarly to access the impact on supply chain performance, carefully measure different SFs of SCF on cost performance, logistics performance and customer satisfaction performance.

abstract={In the current competitive and globalized market situation, the supply chain performance (SCP) and supply chain management (SCM) practices such as supply chain strategy (SCS), supply chain flexibility (SCF) are playing a very important role in enhancing the overall performance of any organization. A hike is noted in the number of firms trying their utmost to achieve strategic competitiveness through befitting implementation of SCM practices, and thereby taking their performance to the next level. SCM, now turned out as one of the fastest growing and key area in management, as a result of which, it successfully grabbed the attention of top management in respective organizations. This study significantly examines the relationship of SCS; SCF with SCP in the Indian automobile industry, and this association was examined through statistical methods such as the correlation coefficient (Pearson) and structural equation modeling (SEM). The final result reveals that SCS and SCF have a momentous correlation with SCP. Specially SCS parameters such as innovative strategy (INS), customer-oriented strategy (COS), and agile supply chain strategy (ASCS) has a high correlation with SCP. The SEM result also shows that SCF parameters such as Innovative &new product flexibility (IF), process flexibility (PF), delivery flexibility (DF), information flexibility (INF) and existing product flexibility (EPF) appear to be of chief importance and show evidence of the importance of SCP.The result shows the significant importance of SCP of the automotive industry in India. The result findings also suggest that the automotive industry should firmly emphasis on SCM practices. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.},

abstract={Sensing and its electronics based on printed/flexible electronics offer unique attributes of mechanical flexibility of its substrate, hence the unique applications. Nevertheless, one of the ensuing key challenges of flexible-electronics-based sensing is the issues associated with consistency and repeatability of its parameters of the flexible electronics elements/sensors due to their variations, which are sometimes intractable. These may be due to manufacturing variations, aging, when the substrate is bent, and so on. In this article, we describe our codesign between the different chains of the flexible electronics supply chain to derive practically flexible electronics and sensors for applications where the substrate is expected to bend, e.g., in an augmented sensing e-skin smart glove application. This effort includes our fully additive lowerature all-air low-cost screen printing process, and how we obtain consistency and repeatability. To improve the matching of thin-film transistors - a critical consideration for conditioning sensor outputs - we describe layout techniques where relatively good matching can be achieved, but with area overheads. We describe how we accommodate the variations of printed elements and circuits embodying printed elements when the substrate is bent - a self-compensating means - and propose the application of the same for printed sensors. The cost of our self-compensation means is without power or area overheads, albeit more (uncomplicated) printing steps. We finally describe our process development kit (PDK) encompassing all of the aforesaid to predict the performance of the printed circuits and sensors, including the effects of bending and our proposed self-compensation thereto. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods based on measurements on printed elements and circuits. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This study explores trust and shared vision moderate the relationship between the manufacturer's influence strategies and supplier delivery flexibility. The major components of this study are based on reviews of marketing research that focus on influence strategies and literature regarding supply chain flexibility. The results show that the request strategy has a negative effect on supplier delivery flexibility. The model predicts that trust and shared vision have an asymmetrical effect across recommendations, information exchange, and promises influence strategies. When the relationship contains a highly shared vision, a manufacturer's use of the recommendation influence strongly promotes supplier delivery flexibility, whereas the use of a promise strategy depresses supplier delivery flexibility. In contrast, an information exchange strategy will have a negative effect, but the promise strategy will have a positive effect on supplier delivery flexibility when trust is high. This paper contributes to guidelines for management on how to align their suppliers for delivery flexibility to respond quickly to customer demands. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This article considers a dynamic supply chain environment consisting of one manufacturer and two retailers. This paper aims to study a retailer facing the an upstream (manufacturer) while implementing technology innovation and facing another retailer (competitor) in competition in the same industry. Specifically, this paper studies how should the retailer choose the control strategies to gain an advantage over the competition? In the corresponding situations, how should the manufacturer optimize its strategies? The paper describes the problem as a Stackelberg game between the manufacturer and the retailers and a Nash game between the two retailers. Through careful study of analytical solutions and numerical cases, the study has drawn some conclusions of management significance. First, this paper abstracts the process innovation, and creatively characterises the manufacturer's mastery of green innovation technology during production through a dynamic process. This paper finds that process innovation is the optimal strategy for the manufacturer in the long-term operation. Second, the strategy of the manufacturer about process innovation is influenced by different strategies of different retailers and different market conditions. However, the manufacturer will obtain more benefit if the retailer with low advertising influence in the same industry occupies the main market. Finally, this paper mainly considers the advertising competition between retailers. The retailer with low advertising influence should make full use of the weapon of advertising publicity to improve its competitive advantages in the same industry. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Flexibility in supply chain networks dealing with uncertainty, has become a research challenge over the past years. This work proposes a flexible supply chain network design (SCND) model that uses generalized production/warehousing nodes instead of individual production plants and warehouses while conquers with demand uncertainty using a scenario-based approach. It also deals with inventory management and decisions on strategical and tactical level (facility location, production rate, warehouse capacity, demand allocation between generalized nodes, inventory levels, product flows, suppliers’ product availability and links between all facilities). The proposed Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model allows intra-layer flows between generalized nodes and aims at minimizing total network cost. A case study is formed to test the applicability of the model for a medium sized European company. A comparison was made between a classic supply chain network and generalized network that deals with uncertainty. Results have revealed cost benefits for this model, making it not only applicable, but also cost effective for the company that will apply it. This decision support system, can help managers in taking strategic decisions such as facility location, with a higher level of accuracy. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

The research presents the profit-maximization problem and devises a method for making cross-enterprise dynamic joint decisions by combining calculus with dynamic programming for a retailer-led Stackelberg supply chain under cooperative and non-cooperative game settings over a multi-period planning horizon. The applicability of the proposed model is assessed using a case study involving a highly perishable product, sliced raw fish, in a supply chain comprising a regional seafood supplier and a local store belonging to a large national retail chain. The analytical results show that, in a cooperative setting, the EM with a consigned revenue-sharing VMI contract tends to achieve lower retail prices, larger stock quantity, improved channel efficiency, and increases in both retailer and supplier profits through an additional one-part tariff. Additionally, consumers benefit from lower retail prices and society benefits from increased overall channel profits in the cooperative channel and EM. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: The paper investigates firms' optimal pricing policies and green strategies in a dynamic green supply chain with consideration of different retail service strategies. The purpose of the paper is to address the following research questions: (1) What are the optimal pricing policies and green strategies of the dynamic decentralized supply chain with the competitive or supportive retail service? (2) How does the dynamic consumer's perception of green product affect these equilibrium solutions? Design/methodology/approach: The paper establishes the dynamic game models and then derives a firm's instantaneous and steady-state feedback equilibrium solutions in three scenarios as follows: (1) the integrated supply chain; (2) the decentralized supply chain with competitive retail service and (3) the decentralized supply chain with supportive retail service. Finally, we conduct numerical analyses to compare the firm's instantaneous and steady-state equilibrium solutions and profit in the three scenarios. Findings: The theoretical and numerical analysis results suggest that the supportive retail service is less inefficient than the competitive retail service in the decentralized supply chain and that the types of retail service have no influence on the green strategy. Moreover, a firm's myopia leads to lowering the greenness degree, retail service level and severe price competition, resulting in economic losses. Consumers’ initial perception of greenness degree determines whether the retailer should adopt the skimming pricing strategy or penetration pricing strategy. Furthermore, only when consumers’ perception of greenness degree is higher than a threshold, will the manufacturer produce green product with positive greenness degree. Originality/value: This is one of few studies on the effect of different types of retail service on horizontal competition in green supply chain. The extension of the static study by adopting differential game approaches provides researchers with a deeper understanding of the application of retail service in green supply chain. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={A distribution case pack contains an assortment of varying quantities of different stock keeping units (SKUs) packed in a single box or pallet, with a goal of reducing handling requirements in the distribution chain. This article studies case pack procurement planning problems that address the trade-off between reduced order handling costs and higher inventory-related costs under dynamic, deterministic demand. The properties of optimal solutions for special cases of the problem involving one and two case packs are first established and these properties are used to solve the problem via dynamic programming. For the general model with multiple predefined case packs, which is shown to be strongly NP-hard, the exact approach is generalized to solve the problem in pseudopolynomial time for a fixed number of case packs. In addition, for large-size problems, the problem formulation is strengthed using valid inequalities and a family of heuristic solutions is designed. Computational tests show that these heuristic approaches perform very well compared to the commercial mixed-integer programming solver CPLEX. In addition to providing detailed methods for solving problems with deterministic demand, strategies for addressing problems with uncertain demands are discussed.

abstract={Understanding the formation of supply chain flexibility is important. We draw on the organizational learning perspective to examine how inter-organizational systems (IOS) enabled collaborative knowledge creation can enhance the supply chain flexibility. Empirical results from 141 supply chain enterprises support most of our hypotheses. The results show that, (1) IOS use for exploration has positive effects on supply chain flexibility and collaborative knowledge creation plays a partially mediated role between them; (2) Market uncertainty moderates the relationship between IOS use for exploration for collaborative knowledge creation. And (3) under the greater uncertainty in the market environment, the relationship between company's collaborative knowledge creation and supply chain flexibility becomes stronger. This result suggests when supply chain enterprises face market uncertainty, they need to improve the level of IOS use for exploration to facilitate understanding of the market, which will improve the supply chain flexibility.},

abstract={This article aims at studying the strategic behaviours of competing firms with sticky retail pricing for the product. We base our study in the context of a supply chain network comprising multiple manufacturers and retailers. The manufacturers are involved in the production of a homogeneous product while the retailers purchase the product and sell it to consumers in the end markets. The retail price of the product is sticky. A differential variational inequality model is proposed to handle the multiple agents and their independent behaviours. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the dynamic supply chain network with sticky price are shown. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the model and the computational results of equilibrium behaviour are presented. This paper contributes to literature by introducing price stickiness into supply chain networks and developing a differential variational inequality model to analyze the dynamic strategies of firms in the decentralized supply chain network. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical weaknesses in the US food supply chain. Faced with the near-complete loss of the food service distribution channel, stories of wasted food, failing suppliers, and food shortages were common. We argue that the pandemic revealed a fundamental lack of resilience in the food supply chain that, while causing short-term welfare losses, need not have happened, and resulted from a failure of vision rather than a market failure in the traditional sense. We present a model of supply chain flexibility, grounded in real options theory, that demonstrates how firms can increase shareholder value by maintaining flexibility across supply chains. We present an example from the US fresh produce industry (onions) to demonstrate our hypothesis. © 2020 Agricultural & Applied Economics Association},

abstract={This article first introduces the research background and related technologies, according to the requirements of the early warning system; distinguishes the overall structure and functional modules of the early warning system software; and explains the design of its database and GIS. In order to solve the problem of relatively few traditional software functions, frequent switching of various systems is required, which is very troublesome to use. In order to overlap with high-precision rainfall prediction and obtain prediction accuracy, wavelet neural network and NARX dynamic neural network are used to predict rainfall tendency and rainfall, and the error of overlap prediction is analyzed. This method can provide high-precision prediction of rainfall and ensure the dynamic stability of the slope. The survey results show that there is an obvious correlation between the functional effects of the enterprise logistics management information system and the elasticity of the supply chain network. In other words, the application of logistics management information system can make the elasticity of the enterprise supply chain network lower. Then, this article analyzes the internal cooperation risks and external risks of the supply chain network and proposes a dual-cycle mode of supply chain network risk management. What is important is that each member of the supply chain network must design and sign contracts and establish a contract mechanism for risk sharing. Study the experienced risk events, and establish a learning mechanism. In order to improve the adaptability of the supply chain to the environment, a corresponding elastic mechanism needs to be established. Establish an emergency response mechanism to respond to emergency situations in a timely manner. At the same time, the government establishes a public mechanism to improve the ability of the supply chain network to deal with external risks, and ultimately can manage the risks of the supply chain network flexibly, and improve the risk prevention capabilities of the enterprise supply chain. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

abstract={Background: In recent years, organizational maturity has disseminated its concepts to various management domains, for instance, Supply Chain Management (SCM). The present paper is an attempt to review the developments in the realm of SCM over the past two decades. In the domain of SCM maturity, different models, dimensions (areas) and approaches are advanced for maturity measurements. Methods: Research studies conducted and presented in the literature, including papers on conference proceedings, articles in journals and technical reports, are reviewed; the review covers a time span from the early 1990s to the present time (2019). Also provided in this review are the previous models, dimensions (areas/ elements), and approaches for measuring SCM maturity techniques. Additionally, research gaps are identified, analysed and discussed. Results: After reviewing, the research studies in the field and the dimensions found in the works are placed into different categories. The current study aims to present a review of the literature, ultimately providing help to researchers in realizing gaps and opportunities in the field of SCM maturity. There are also different approaches to supply chain maturity models. For example, one approach may solely focus on integration while another might concentrate on SC visibility and traceability. In more recent research studies, more attention is paid to such specific areas of supply chain as flexibility and sustainability. The results of the present paper point to gaps, which indicate that more research works are required. In addition, it is assumed that the materials presented here may help establish more comprehensive SCM maturity models. Conclusions: It is seen that supply chain management is rapidly shifting toward e-SCM, and some other technologies like blockchain. Also, supply chain sustainability comes to the fore as a significant approach. It should be reminded that other strategic features of supply chains like leanness, agility, resilience, sustainability, integration, green and reverse logistics etc., also play their own role in the field. Combining these strategic features can be an effective idea for developing more comprehensive models for SCM maturity. To sum up, the results of the present survey indicate that the published works need more adequacy and treatment research, and that more research is called for to bridge the gaps in the realm of SCM maturity. © Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska.},

abstract={In today’s market, sales promotional schemes have spun out to be essential for promoting outfits. Nonetheless, due to the sudden ascent in sales, the subsequent demand uncertainty calls for the high flexibility in supply chains. The present work examines the barriers to flexibility in the Indian automobile supply chains under such an environment from a sustainability viewpoint, an indispensable element of the present-day supply chains. In view of the literature and the descriptive survey led, 20 barriers have been identified. Through the analytical investigation directed, a numerical index value for the sustainable supply chain flexibility barriers is developed via graph-theoretical and matrix approach. Findings, along with the sensitivity analysis, conducted establish that the barriers at the supply chain’s procurement function have the highest impact in inhibiting the sustainable supply chain flexibility, thus significantly affecting the firm performance during sales promotional schemes. The obtained barrier index can be utilised for assessing the performance of all the companies across the industry. The model proposed offers valuable discernments to practicing officials in focusing on the significant barriers. This study augments the existing literature by linking the supply chain flexibility, Sustainability, and Sales promotions and thus clubs the three independent research streams. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In today’s competitive market of globalization, supply chain flexibility (SCF) has emerged as a potential weapon to address various uncertainties and associated risks. Offering sales promotional schemes (SPSs) is one of the obvious and inevitable features in the present competitive commercial environment, affecting demand uncertainty severely. This paper models the SCF of automobile industry under SPS environment. Supply chain professionals from two automobile OEMs are involved in the process of identifying 14 SCF strategies that are relevant to the present study. Personal interviews have been conducted with about 15 field managers from these industries and the causal relationships between these flexibility strategies have been established using a structured Fuzzy DEMATEL questionnaire. Using Fuzzy DEMATEL methodology, the identified strategies are ranked based on their degree of influence and classified into cause/effect groups. Based on the analysis, four strategies, viz. volume flexibility, manufacturing flexibility, supplier collaboration flexibility and supplier flexibility, have been recognized to play a decisive role in firm’s performance. The systematic elucidation of the model offers modest bunch bits of knowledge to practicing field experts to ken the utmost essential approaches influencing the performance of the firm in terms of their impelling strength. This helps them in crucial decision-making during SPS. Also, the present investigation will help in spanning the SCF with sales promotions, an unexplored gap in the earlier studies. © 2018, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.},

abstract={In the competitive market of today, supply chain flexibility (SCF) plays crucial way to address various supply chain uncertainties. But, in diverse situations, the supply chain needs different types of flexibilities. This paper analyses the flexibility of an automobile supply chain under sales promotional schemes (SPS) to meet the demand uncertainty. Taking the opinion of supply chain experts from automobile original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s), 14 SCF strategies have been identified and then using interpretive structural modelling (ISM) on the conducted survey, their interrelationships are established and a hierarchical model is developed. MICMAC analysis is done to classify the strategies into four categories viz. autonomous, dependent, linkage and independent strategies, which are based on their driving and dependence powers. Sensitivity analysis has been conducted to check the stability of the model. The thorough exposition of the model presents a handful of insights to supply chain managers to know the most important strategies affecting each other. The study helps in bridging the SCF with SPS, a huge gap existing in the literature. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Perishable foods at undesired temperatures can generate foodborne illnesses that present significant societal costs. To certify refrigeration succession in a food-supply chain, a flexible, easy-to-interpret, damage-tolerant, and sensitive time-temperature indicator (TTI) that uses a self-healing nanofiber mat is devised. This mat is opaque when refrigerated due to nanofiber-induced light scattering, but becomes irreversibly transparent at room temperature through self-healing-induced interfibrillar fusion leading to the appearance of a warning sign. The mat monitors both freezer (−20 °C) and chiller (2 °C) successions and its timer is tunable over the 0.5–22.5 h range through control of the polymer composition and film thickness. The thin mat itself serves as both a temperature sensor and display; it does not require modularization, accurately measures localized or gradient heat, and functions even after crushing, cutting, and when weight-loaded in a manner that existing TTIs cannot. It also contains no drainable chemicals and is attachable to various shapes because it operates through an intrinsic physical response. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

abstract={Supply chain management is a well-developed area. The traditional supply chains are dynamic systems which include the forward and reverse flows of physical products and the related information and fund. However, a service supply chain is different because the real "product" may take the form of a "service" which implies that many traditionally crucial decisions in supply chain management such as product shipping problems are no longer important. Here, a service supply chain is defined as a supply network that transfers resources into services or servitised products, with or without physical products, to satisfy customer needs. As a result, managing a service supply chain system requires innovative strategies with new models. Currently, there is an absence of a comprehensive reference source that provides the state-of-the-art findings on this important topic. It will thus be significant to develop a well-balanced edited volume that includes both theoretical results (from different perspectives) and application cases/studies on service supply chain systems. This book is a pioneering text on service supply chain systems. It features papers which adopt the systems engineering approach in conducting service supply chain analysis. It includes both theoretical results (from different perspectives) and application cases/studies on service supply chain systems. It will be a good reference book for industrialists and academics who are interested in the service industry, service operations, service management, and service sciences. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.

abstract={The supply chain is a new business model for supply chain planning or transportation management that aims to enhance supply chain flexibility. Rather of having the resources and skills in-house, supply chain can be purchased as a service and paid for on a per-use basis. Service providers’ specialization and focus enable them to achieve economies of scale as well as economies of scope, as well as lucrative outsourcing options. Industry 4.0 causes upheaval and forces businesses to reconsider how they build their supply chains. A number of new technologies have developed that are disrupting traditional working practices. Agility is a critical component of business success in complex industrial environments because it allows companies to compete effectively in a competitive market. Firms are increasing relying on information systems in achieving such agility throughout the supply chain. The chain becomes a fully connected ecosystem that is fully transparent to all parties involved, from raw material, component, and part suppliers through transporters of those supplies and completed items, and lastly to the customers expecting fulfilment, thanks to digitization. This chapter aims to explain the framework of digitization in agile supply chain management. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Biorefineries are globally contemplated as the viable platforms for the highly anticipated substitution of fossil-based economy by the bio-based economy. A biorefinery offers the advantage of converting a remarkable variety of biomass feedstocks to different types of biofuels and biochemicals. A great extent of rigorous effort is currently being made for the upgrading of existing biorefinery frameworks to fully attain the sustainability standards required to warrant their full-scale implementation. As a consequence of the mandatory inclusion of the sustainability goals into the biorefinery concept and the escalating concern on the ‘food-fuel conflict’, the second generation (2G) of biorefineries are garnering quick popularity over their first-generation counterparts. In India, there exist huge prospects of development of 2G biorefineries exploiting the abundant resources of the lignocellulosic agro-wastes. Indian agro-wastes display an extraordinary variety of lignocellulosic biomass and round-the-year availability in copious amounts. Unfortunately, due to lack of awareness and poor valorization, these valuable agro-wastes are often destroyed in mass scale for waste management instead of being utilized in a productive way. The major focus of the present chapter is to present a categorical classification of Indian agro-wastes based on their appearance in the supply chain. The adaptability of Indian agro-wastes towards 2G biorefinery has been assessed using their availability, thermochemical properties and composition of a few specific feedstocks, namely, rice straw, rice husk, wheat straw, oil seed press cakes, sugarcane bagasse, coconut shell, banana peels and stems. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been used to decide on the strategy of application of stand-alone biochemical or thermochemical processes and their hybrids for the conversion of different candidate feedstocks in the 2G biorefineries with respect to sustainability parameters. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Closed-loop production systems encompass all processes for returning, remanufacturing, recycling, discarding, and repackaging products. These elements form the core of sustainable manufacturing by managing what otherwise would be waste to enable reuse and by controlling its associated pollution. This paper presents the general management model of sustainable remanufacturing within a dynamic closed-loop supply chain. Our specification encompasses agents positioned at key stages in the supply chain, e.g., manufacturers, retailers, and customers, and considers both profitability and environmental performance of their decentralized decisions. We cast the problem to allow for interdependence of agents through a Nash game. These salient features simultaneously render the mathematical model more realistic and computationally challenging. To proceed, our model is formalized by using variational inequalities, which in turn are converted to a fixed point problem that we solve using a computationally tractable algorithm. Decision rules for strategic remanufacturing and recycling are provided to complement the numerical solution in an illustrative example. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper presents a model of the strategic behavior of firms operating in a spatial supply chain network. The manufacturing and retailing firms engage in an oligopolistic, noncooperative game by sharing customer demand such that a firm's decisions impact the product prices, which in turn result in changes in all other firms' decisions. Each firm's payoff is to maximize its own profit and we show that, in response to such changes in prices and to exogenous environmental taxes, the manufacturing firms may strategically alter a variety of choices such as 'make-buy' decisions with respect to intermediate inputs, spatial distribution of production, product shipment patterns and inventory management, environmental tax payment vs recycling decisions, and timing of all such choices to sustainably manage the profit and the environmental regulations. An important implication is that effects of a tax depends on the oligopolistic game structure. With respect to methods, we show that this dynamic game can be represented as a set of differential variational inequalities (DVIs) that motivate a computationally efficient nonlinear complementarity (NCP) approach that enables the full exploitation of above-mentioned salient features. We also provide a numerical example that confirms the utility of our proposed framework and shows substantial strategic reaction can be expected to a tax on pollution stocks. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={With global competition rapidly intensifying and shifting to the supply chain level, supply chain flexibility (SCF) is becoming increasingly important. Despite its importance, the literature on SCF is limited. In group decision-making problems, the experts have their different backgrounds, experience, and knowledge. The experts use different linguistic term sets with different cardinalities (multi-granularity linguistic term sets) to express individual assessment information. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a new fuzzy fusion method to deal with the heterogeneous group of experts problem with multi-granularity linguistic assessment information, and used to improve the SCF evaluation process. The results of this study are more objective and unbiased for two reasons. First, the results are generated by heterogeneous group decision-making with multi-granularity linguistic assessment information. Second, the fuzzy linguistic approach has more advantage to preserve no loss of information. Additionally, an example using a case study is used to illustrate the availability of the proposed method. We also show that the linguistic assessment of SCF is reasonable. © 2014 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers.},

abstract={Natural disasters can wreck havoc on business operations. When civil unrest swept the UK in August 2011, the effect on business was stark, losing the retail sector £300m in unexpected costs and lost revenues. On the other side of the world, the natural disaster that hit Japan in early 2011 is estimated to have run up costs in the region of £189bn in repairs. Beyond this, the earthquake and its aftermath shattered supply chains, with technology companies expecting delays of up to six months before business could resume fully. It is impossible to predict incidents like these, but businesses can help mitigate disruption in the supply chain by undertaking business continuity management (BCM). A flexible supply chain is essential when it comes to BCM - whether it means being able to cope with altering transport routes at short notice, or finding or replacing a supplier at the last minute. Understanding the supply chain is critical when responding to major impacts that affect supply chains in multiple points - like IT system failures and country-wide fuel strikes. Businesses should carry out detailed business impact assessments and risk assessments right across the end-to-end supply chain and not just at key single points of failure. It is an intensive process that needs dedicated resources and ownership at the highest level. Recognising this, DHL has designed a 10-step process, which it has implemented across its global supply chain business. This paper provides an overview of what a supply chain really looks like, what can cause disruptions and how far up/down the supply chain companies need to go with their BCM planning.},

abstract={The integrated analysis of quality and production logistics in manufacturing systems has recently attracted increasing interest among researchers and industrialists. It has been shown that several links exist among the manufacturing system design and the product quality, which are dominated by complex dynamic interactions. However, these interactions have never been addressed in manufacturing systems producing perishable products. The quality characteristics of perishable products deteriorate over time. Several examples of this phenomenon are found in the food industry, in semiconductor manufacturing, and in polymers forming processes. If the time parts spend in the system exceeds a certain threshold the inventory becomes obsolete and defective parts need to be scrapped. A similar problem is also found in highly dynamic supply chains. In this paper, we provide an analytical method to model the dynamics of this phenomenon in a buffered two-machines line with general Markovian machines. The main contribution is a method for the calculation of the lead time distribution, that allows us to derive predictions of the effective throughout and scrap rate. In case of two-state machines the approach leads to symbolic expressions while in case of general Markovian machines numerical solutions can be obtained. Numerical results provide relevant insights on the problem and show counterintuitive behaviors paving the way to the design of buffers for product quality. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to provide a better understanding of the behaviour of wine consumers in a completely new and unexpected setting, that is, a forced lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It seeks to explain consumer decisions and the probability of changes occurring in wine expenditure compared to a normal situation. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis, conducted on a representative sample of Iberian consumers and based on the random utility theory, consists in the application of a multinomial logit model, setting the “usual” pattern of expenditure as a baseline category. Findings: The results show that the coronavirus pandemic could have changed alcohol drinking habits. Consumers generally spent less on wine during the lockdown, maybe due to the uncertainty regarding their future income and professional situation. Those people more likely to spend more on wine were those who increased their wine consumption during the lockdown, those who drank for romantic purposes, those who purchased less wine in supermarkets but more online, those who used a wine app and those living in urban areas. The increased consumption of other alcoholic beverages also increases the probability of spending less than usual on wine. Additionally, the absence of certain reasons for drinking wine other than social purposes, such as wine and food pairing, its taste and relaxing effects, together with the previous consumption pattern leads to a decrease in the probability of spending less per bottle. Originality/value: This paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of the determinants of wine consumption in a very abnormal setting, an imposed lockdown and provides important policy implications. The findings show that managers and policymakers should pay attention to the different influence of variables related to behaviour and consumption patterns that may contribute to an increase in the demand for less expensive wines. Specifically, they should focus on new consumption patterns that may arise, adapting the supply chain and defining appropriate marketing strategies to fill new market segments. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Service infusion in the machine tool industry is regarded as a key-competitive factor for the future of this strategic sector and of manufacturing companies that use machine tools for production. This chapter illustrates the findings of a research that was conducted at European level to assess the state of the art of servitization in the machine tool sector and to outline future challenges. Through quantitative research, five clusters of machine tool servitizers were identified, distinguished by the type of service value proposition and the service supply chain configuration. Clusters outlined that, even if the offering of services is very spread in this sector, the servitization process is far from being mature. In fact, the type of offered services are mainly product-related services, many servitizers resulted not to have adapted their supply chain to the service business, and the most advanced service strategies observed in the sample did not lead to additional financial benefits. To allow the in-depth interpretation of these findings, qualitative research aimed at understanding the cultural and managerial approach of clustered servitizers was conducted. A conservative cultural approach was recognized as a strong barrier to servitization. It generally derives from low service competences, but it can also be generated by customers' unbalanced contractual power, which forces machine builders to enter the service arena without being prepared. Case study research permitted also to identify few companies being a successful example of advanced servitization. By analysing their example, it was clear that a proactive attitude to service innovation and the approach to servitization as a multidisciplinary structured change management project can represent a key-success factor. Managerial implications are presented at the end of the chapter, together with suggestions for future research. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Composite materials comprising fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) possess advantageous properties that surpass that of traditional materials. The use of composite materials may give the opportunity to improve the technical specifications of a manufactured module and also impact the configuration of the supply chain. However, this represents a challenging decision-making process as various technologies are available for the manufacturing of composite materials. This paper proposes a design process based on the identification of the bill of materials of a component where the substitution of certain sub-assemblies using composite materials may result in the reduction of parts, operations and suppliers. The design process is supported by a customized software tool that generates a graphic representation of the bill of materials of the selected module, allowing users to choose a specific sub-assembly, select composite materials process types and identify potential suppliers from a database. An industry case involving the production of a module used in urban buses/long distance coach manufacturing is employed to illustrate the proposed design process. The software tool developed satisfactorily integrates the bill-of-materials and current product and process specifications with an existing costing engine and a populated database of potential composite materials suppliers. The approach presented in the paper can be used to address the lack of evaluation tools for using composite materials/carbon fiber. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the impact in terms of Fill Rate of production control policies in a two-product, two-echelon supply chain dynamic problem with production capacity. The factory node is subject to two different disruptive occurrences (i.e. failure events and changeovers) that can cause unforeseen problems in the supply chain. To control these adverse events, the factory can adopt different production control policies. We compare the well-known Hedging Corridor Policy with two variants, namely Modified Hedging Corridor Policy and Improved Modified Hedging Corridor Policy, and Demand-Driven Material Requirements Planning policy. Firstly, we use the Response Surface Methodology to calibrate the endogenous factors for each strategy. Then, through an extended full-factorial Design Of Experiments, we evaluate the effectiveness of the production control policies for several operational and market scenarios defined by varying exogenous factors. Interestingly, our study reveals that the Hedging Corridor Policy represents the best rule to increase the Fill Rate. The policies have been compared also in terms of indicators related to the factory inventory level. The results seem to point out that efficient production control policies (measured in terms of operational efficiency) do not necessarily yield the best results when measured in terms of supply chain efficiency. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper deals with a comparison of production control policies in a two-product two-echelon supply chain dynamic problem with production capacity constraint. The factory related echelon consists of an unreliable manufacturing system that cannot produce both types of products simultaneously. Therefore, changeover operations are required to switch from one type of product to another. The decision on the product changeover depends on the production control policy. This research compares the well-known Hedging Corridor Policy, which has been previously adopted by the literature in a supply chain with production capacity constraints, and the Improved Modified Hedging Corridor Policy, which has been proved to minimize the total cost incurred in manufacturing companies characterized by unreliable production systems with constant demand rate. For comparison purposes, an experimental campaign was conducted through an analytical model based on discrete-time difference equations to investigate the Fill Rate of the multi-product supply chain as response variable. A proper ANDVA analysis and a set of interval plots revealed that the Hedging Corridor Policy outperforms the Improved Modified Hedging Corridor Policy in improving the Fill Rate Indicator. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate a two-echelon, two-product Supply Chain (SC) inspired by a real-world production/distribution firm, in which the product change-over time, necessary to switch from a product to another, induces a variable capacity in the factory. Such a varying production capacity is further exacerbated by the machine breakdowns that may occur in the manufacturing system. Since the two products share the same production system, a production planning rule has to be executed to decide the change-over, i.e. to select the product to be manufactured over time. An extended experimental campaign has been performed to investigate how the fill rate and the standard deviation of inventories vary as a series of operational and tactical parameters changes. Several ANOVA analyses revealed a strong interaction between the production planning model and the adopted smoothing replenishment strategy, which remarkably affects the performance of the SC. Interestingly, a higher value of the proportional controller negatively affects the service levels since the adopted production planning policy, under these circumstances, tends to encourage longer production runs for a certain product and, consequently, persistent stock outs for the other one. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the distinction and relationships between the significant strategic capabilities for managing risks in supply chains. This intersectional review exposes a substantial conceptual contradiction between the perspectives reported by various researchers. Further, the current paper classifies the literature into four categories according to the broad objectives investigated by the research papers. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, a bibliometric analysis aligned with the concepts of a systematic literature review is conducted followed by a descriptive review focusing on models and methods. The software called BibExcel is utilized to extract and analyze the bibliographic information in a textual form from the research articles associated with strategic capabilities of the logistics sector. The results are exported to the software known as Gephi to visualize keyword co-occurrence analysis as networks. A well-structured descriptive review is also conducted to identify avenues for future research. Findings: Despite conventional supply chain capabilities like efficiency and effectiveness, eight significant strategic capabilities of supply chains for managing risks are identified from the literature. These capabilities with positive connotations include flexibility, reliability, resilience, robustness, agility, adaptability, alignment and responsiveness. Considering the vast literature on flexibility/reliability along with its numerous dimensions and scope, the authors found that resilience, robustness, agility, adaptability, alignment and effectiveness are achievable through flexibility/reliability. Accordingly, it is appropriate to state reliability and flexibility as supply chain capabilities to achieve the other six supply chain competencies. Furthermore, the entire literature in this domain can be classified into four genres according to the addressed objectives, namely, concept development/validation, capability assessment, network design and performance evaluation. Research limitations/implications: The information revealed from the keyword co-occurrence analysis along with the research implications provided in the penultimate section will assist budding researchers in framing novel and promising research objectives. Supply chain administrators and policymakers can utilize the literature classification and the notable references provided in this review for locating potential methods for assessing supply chain strategic capabilities, designing the supply chain and evaluating the performance of the supply chain. Originality/value: An integrated bibliometric and descriptive literature review procedure is utilized in this paper. Furthermore, this critical review is the first work on comprehensively mapping the research relationships among various strategic capabilities required for mitigating supply chain risks. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The current design of supply chain (SC) for small garment manufacturing companies in the Philippines has not incorporated green practices to address environmental issues. In the adverse environmental effect of industries worldwide, green supply chain management (GSCM) has appealed to companies to reduce the occurrence of such issues. This study evaluated the current SC design and operations of small garment manufacturing companies with respect to their environmental practices. Using the green supply chain operations reference (G-SCOR) model, data from the subject companies were evaluated based on fifteen (15) indicators of the six (6) attributes which include reliability, responsiveness, agility, cost, asset management efficiency, and green practices. Results revealed that the small garment companies have excellent performance in terms of perfect order fulfillment (POF) and working capital turnover (WCT) while good performances were observed in total SC management cost (TSCM), cost of goods sold (COGS), awareness management, and waste management. In contrast, poor performances were evident in upside supply chain adaptability (USCA), downside supply chain adaptability (DSCA), fixed asset turnover (FAT) ratio, implementation of green procurement, recycled materials, and carbon dioxide (CO2) gas emission. A multiple regression analysis model was also created to determine the significant factors contributing to GSCM. Results revealed that among the indicators, CO2 emission, waste management, and COGS significantly influence the GSCM. To improve the companies’ G-SCOR performance, it is recommended that appropriate environmental practices such as green procurement, recycling, waste management, and reverse logistics should be implemented. Proper information dissemination campaigns should also be done in the companies so that the employees may be educated and be involved in the GSCM practices. © IEOM Society International.},

In order to maintain low cost and stability in the operation of dynamic SC system, a cost optimization strategy (COS) and a robust control strategy (RCS) are investigated. A cost model of LT reduction is set up through the method of piecewise accumulation, and then a COS is designed by the comparison between the LT reduction cost and the shortage cost. By considering production LTs and uncertainties of the external demand and internal parameter for dynamic SC system, an inventory state transition equation and a system cost transition equation are developed. Based on the fuzzy control theory, a RCS is designed to reduce the interference of uncertainties and LTs to the normal operation of the dynamic SC system. Simulation results show that the COS and the RCS can make the dynamic SC system run stably at low cost under disturbance factors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

From the perspective of strengthening supply chain resilience, a new architecture of supply chain which incorporates blockchain mechanisms is proposed. This allows supply chains to strengthen their own resilience without weakening the existing efficiency, so as to fully utilize today's digital technology and achieve rapid innovation and strong integration when faced with crises and challenges in new situations. A particular focus is on extending the application of the blockchain technology to the entire digital business ecosystem. Two Japanese industry examples are used to demonstrate how the new architectural model of supply chain with blockchain mechanism can minimize the losses caused by the stagnation of the supply chain. From these examples, the benefits and risks of the blockchain technology based management to individual enterprises, supply chain and whole digital business ecosystem are identified. © Sabine Baumann 2022.

abstract={In the composites industry, each change must take into account lot of parameters before being able to set it up. This requires an important amount of data sharing in a limited time. Nonetheless, only a minor part of this data is concretely used by the planners for an almost real-time analysis and optimization within production systems. This paper proposes a multi-agent approach for dynamic planning integrated to production and maintenance. According to the supply chain operations reference model (SCOR), to focus on the process of transforming products to a finished state to meet projected or actual demand, we will work on the “make” area of supply chain. This paper aims to present the problem of supply chain dynamic planning considering maintenance interventions and using a multi-agent system (MAS). The main objective of the system is ensuring collaboration between three different entities, planning, production and maintenance in order to take better decisions. To model the proposed system, we used the multi-agent system engineering (MaSE) methodology. © IEOM Society International.},

The supply chain is represented as an optimization model that maximizes the revenue of manufacturers meets the retailers' demand and at the same time identifies the necessary warehouses, particularly for supply chains that are affected by leadtime (LT) variation such as fast response industry and short life products. The model solution is adaptive; it determines the best manufacturing rates and identifies the logistic bottlenecks in dynamic supply chain networks. Numerical solutions along with simulation experiments of different supply chain topologies are presented.

This study is one of the rare practical researches that recognize key factors related to the application of a successful and efficient supply chain strategy. So far, many researchers have conducted studies on responsive supply chain strategy; but in this study, it is sought to focus on efficient supply chain strategies due to increasing need for organizations to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Structural equation modelling using SmartPLS software is used to examine the research assumptions. Analysis of the structural model showed that there is a positive relationship between implementation of efficient supply chain strategy with supply chain performance; therefore the main research hypothesis is confirmed. Research revealed internal integration, top management support and information technology as efficient supply chain characteristics that have positive effects on supply chain performance. To reduce costs of implementation of efficient supply chain strategy, it is necessary to invest in factors that influence supply chain performance positively. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper discusses the application of IIoT in various areas of oil and gas upstream. It elaborates on the drivers of IIoT, presents the advantages and benefits and describes the challenges faced as of today in the implementation. IIoT and cloud computing work hand in hand. IIoT generates huge amount of data and cloud computing provides a pathway to present this data is a useful way and travel to the end user. A detail evaluation of the investment in using this technology and its anticipated returns are demonstrated. IIoT is believed to be an emerging solution for oil and gas complexities. The main drivers behind this technology are data storage, data analytics, reliability improvement and materiality assessment and control. The application of IIoT in areas of artificial lift optimization, Supply chain in real time, cyclic steam stimulation and flow assurance is described. This technology provides real time solution for dynacards interpretation and analysis for Sucker rod pumps, operating point analysis for Electrical submersible pumps and predicted cumulative production for all artificial lift optimization; efficient planning and waste elimination for supply chain and logistics; real time steam quality and quantity check for CSS and a complete digital approach to reservoir management and flow assurance. The main benefits of this technology are reduced MTBF, high efficiency, improved HSE standards, Instantaneous control over production loss, collaborative decisions leading to fast turnaround, highly responsive supply chain and enhancing environmental footprint. This has helped substantially in real time management of wells by exception and alerts in form of intelligent alarms indicating any deviation in the expected behaviour. This has significantly brought down the non-productive time (NPT). However, this paradigm shift comes with a substantial cost.

abstract={Given the emergence of innovative processes in recent years for the manufacture of bioproducts from second-generation biomass, a range of unique biorefinery strategies are likely to be implemented by forest product companies in the coming years. No matter what biorefinery strategy is employed, to compete in the longer term, it will be critical to have a supply-chain adapted to the targeted products. In order to meet customer needs and at the same time be cost-competitive, there are trade-offs to be made between responsiveness and efficiency in several areas of the supply chain, such as production and customer service. This paper reviews supply-chain characteristics and competitive factors for various bioproducts. An approach that can be used by decision-makers during early-stage design is presented, suitable for screening-out less promising options based on their supply-chain characteristics. Fundamental aspects such as the differentiation of products, their possible green advantage, biomass procurement, and process characteristics are discussed within five categories: bioenergy, biofuels, commodity biochemicals, fine and specialty biochemicals, and biomaterials. Several examples of biorefinery strategies are discussed to illustrate these concepts. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The biorefinery concept offers a promising solution to transform the struggling forestry industry. Not only will the implementation of new products and processes help to diversify revenues, it will also offer an opportunity to change the manufacturing culture by better managing the flexibility of assets to react to volatile market conditions. In this paper, an integrated supply-chain planning framework is presented. It is based on optimizing a superstructure to help decision makers identify different supply-chain policies to adapt to different market conditions. It integrates revenue management concepts, activity-based cost accounting principles, manufacturing flexibility and supply-chain flexibility in a tactical model to maximize profit in a price-volatile environment. A case study of a newsprint mill implementing a parallel biomass fractionation line producing several biochemicals is used to illustrate this approach. Results and benefits are presented for the traditional pulp and paper business and for the transformed biorefinery in different market scenarios. © 2014.},

abstract={High-profit-margin gas plants are often challenged by low crude price and fluctuations in processed natural gas quality and quantities demanded by markets. A more challenging factor is the rapid variation in the demand of the products across gas supply chain. These challenges require high operational flexibility across the supply chain to adapt its product portfolio to the market-changes. To this end, optimization of the entire supply chain is highly essential to address these pressing challenges. This paper details an optimization analysis of a countrywide gas supply chain typical to the Middle East region. A unified optimization model that encompasses all the supply chain components is formulated. The model, in its most general form, comprises of 446 decision variables and 190 constraints, which is solved using an evolutionary algorithm. The key application of the proposed model is that it can be used in assessing the optimum allocation of the gas across the various layers of supply chain to maximize countrywide total profit. The model shows that an increase of 3% in profit can be achieved. The model is also used to predict future gas allocations under different scenarios based on fifteen-year profile of gas profiles, costs, product yields and contractual terms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={At 00:02 on 14th November 2016, a Mw 7.8 earthquake occurred in and offshore of the northeast of the South Island of New Zealand. Fault rupture, ground shaking, liquefaction, and co-seismic landslides caused severe damage to distributed infrastructure, and particularly transportation networks; large segments of the country's main highway, State Highway 1 (SHI), and the Main North Line (MNL) railway line, were damaged between Picton and Christchurch. The damage caused direct local impacts, including isolation of communities, and wider regional impacts, including disruption of supply chains. Adaptive measures have ensured immediate continued regional transport of goods and people. Air and sea transport increased quickly, both for emergency response and to ensure routine transport of goods. Road diversions have also allowed critical connections to remain operable. This effective response to regional transport challenges allowed Civil Defence Emergency Management to quickly prioritise access to isolated settlements, all of which had road access 23 days after the earthquake. However, 100 days after the earthquake, critical segments of SHI and the MNL remain closed and their ongoing repairs are a serious national strategic, as well as local, concern. This paper presents the impacts on South Island transport infrastructure, and subsequent management through the emergency response and early recovery phases, during the first 100 days following the initial earthquake, and highlights lessons for transportation system resilience.},

abstract={Purpose: Utilizing a top-down approach of middle-range theorizing (MRT), the purpose of this paper is to integrate relational exchange with institutional theory to examine how companies manage supply chain relationships to achieve desired supply chain outcomes in industries characterized by varying degrees of regulatory mandates that restrict the choice of supply chain partners. The authors identify this supply chain relationship dynamic as constrained choice. Design/methodology/approach: A moderated mediation model is tested using survey data from producers in the US wine industry to investigate the effects of regulatory pressure on the ability of wine producers to achieve operational coordination when responding to relational behaviors through either trust or calculative commitment. Findings: Results find that relational behaviors can improve operational coordination through two distinct paths: trust or calculative commitment. With the moderating effect of regulatory pressure, relational behaviors more effectively facilitate operational coordination through trust. Alternately, regulatory pressure attenuates the mediated relationship through calculative commitment. Research limitations/implications: The research introduces constrained choice dynamics into the supply chain relationship literature via MRT. Integrating generative mechanisms from relational exchange and institutional theories provides theoretical depth and context-specific knowledge about relationships that operate in constrained choice situations. Practical implications: Managers impacted by constrained choice should recognize that mechanisms typically resulting in positive relationship outcomes may respond differently in the presence of regulatory constraints. With greater regulatory pressure, efforts to enhance operational coordination are more effective using relational mechanisms to build trust. When trust is diminished, calculative commitment can be effective in achieving operational coordination, although extensive regulations make it more difficult. Originality/value: Previous research traditionally assumes that managers are free to select suitable trading partners that ensure mutually beneficial relationships. The research develops a middle-range theory examining the constrained choice dynamic in relationships that are impacted to varying degrees by regulatory institutions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The frequency and intensity of disasters continue to increase. Following large-scale and catastrophic disasters, local organisations integrate with other responding organisations to form hastily disaster relief supply chain networks. Such supply networks are infrequently activated in a single location, generate unparalleled uncertainty, change quickly, and are driven by the urgency of saving lives and restoring livelihoods. Unfortunately, even where sound supply chain management practices are used, supply networks have encountered diverse levels of resilience and adequate disaster relief performance has remained elusive. In this paper, several unique characteristics that disaster relief efforts exhibit are examined as compared with demand-driven, steady-state supply chains. Important differences in the flows of resource, money, and information are identified. A complex adaptive supply network (CASN) lens is used to frame what existing literature has uncovered regarding disaster relief efforts, showing how relief organisations, their interactions, and their environmental context help determine the level of resilience that supply networks experience following disasters. This CASN characterisation is leveraged to help explain why traditional supply chain management practices lead to varied results in disaster relief. Finally, complexity science theory is drawn on to set forth eight testable propositions that may help to enhance supply network resilience. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper introduces a dynamic game modeling several interfaces between marketing and operations under vertical coordination and horizontal supply chain (SC) competition. An SC has a one-manufacturer-one-retailer structure and competes against a symmetric SC. In each SC, the manufacturer decides both the production volume and the advertising efforts, while the retailer controls both the purchasing volume and the selling price. Firms within each SC can manage their business by adopting either a wholesale price contract (WPC) or a revenue-sharing contract (RSC). In general, an SC can achieve coordination when shifting from a WPC to an RSC. Nevertheless, this is no longer true when SC competition exists. We show that an RSC is beneficial only when the rival SC uses a WPC. In fact, when both SCs adopt an RSC, the general advantages gained through coordination vanish and both SCs are operationally and economically worse off. © 2021 The Authors.

The main novelty of the paper concerns a comparison between static and dynamic solutions of the supply chain game achieved when moving from traditional to digital platforms. Therefore, this study proposes centralized and decentralized versions of the game, comparing their solutions under static and dynamic settings. Moreover, it investigates the decentralized supply chain by evaluating two smart contracts: Revenue sharing and wholesale price contracts. In both cases, the firms use an artificial intelligence system to determine the optimal contract parameters. Numerical and qualitative analyses are used for comparing configurations (centralized, decentralized), settings (static, dynamic), and contract schemes (revenue sharing contract, wholesale price contract). The findings identify the conditions under which smart revenue sharing mechanisms are worth applying. © 2019 by the author.},

abstract={This paper analyzes two incentive schemes available for a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) in which a manufacturer and a retailer contribute to the return rate dynamics through their investments in green activity programs. Both firms have economic motivations to perform the return rate because customers who return end-of-use goods also repurchase new ones. In addition, the manufacturer exploits the returns’ residual value in operations to increase profits. Because the manufacturer has both operational and marketing motivations to close the loop, he can provide an incentive to the retailer to boost her investments in green activity programs. The incentive can be either state dependent or control dependent. The former assumes that the incentive depends on the fraction of customers who are willing to return end-of-use products; the latter is proportional to the retailer’s green activity programs efforts. Our results show that a state-dependent incentive is profit-Pareto-improving only when the retailer’s environmental effectiveness is large. In contrast, a control-dependent incentive mechanism is profit-Pareto-improving for low incentive values, high retailer’s environmental effectiveness, and customers’ repurchasing intention. In all other cases, players have divergent preferences and neither mechanism coordinates the CLSC. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

However, the SCM 4.0 impacts the decision-making towards higher complexity [3]. Technology-wise many companies have adapted SCM 4.0. This paper claims that organizational and leadership matters have not yet gone through similar transition; Actually, we can neither see any changes in the way companies organize supply chains nor in how they facilitate practice-based learning of employees and leaders. With SCM 4.0 technologies, an effective supply chain is not just a question of transforming components to finished goods. Rather, the contemporary SCM organizations need a strong transdisciplinary practice-based learning agenda to be able to deliver customer value [4], [5]. With the purpose of understanding transdisciplinary levers for practice-based learning in SCM, the study builds on two cases of implementation of SCM 4.0 technologies, exploring how the case companies have managed the transformation from a classic 2.0 to a 4.0 practice-based learning organization. The research question guiding the study is: to what extent can practise-based learning be a lever for adapting SCM 4.0?. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={Three approaches commonly are identified for controlling automobile greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: reducing travel demand, improving vehicle efficiency and using alternatively (non-petroleum) fueled vehicles (AFVs). Similarly, sector emissions are factored by travel distance, vehicle fuel intensity and fuel GHG ("carbon") intensity. Analyzing these factors using US and China data reveals that for a broad range of conditions, stringent GHG emissions limits for the auto sector imply limits of comparable stringency for fuel carbon intensity. However, carbon intensity is a modeled representation of complex energy supply and use systems rather than a measurable property of fuels themselves. Carefully examining the locations and magnitudes of fuel-related emissions indicates that the proper policy focus is on the sectors that supply fuel rather than the choice of fuels in the auto sector. Therefore, beyond fundamental R&D, policies to commercialize AFVs are not necessarily required for climate protection at present. In addition to managing travel demand and improving vehicle efficiency, the implied policy priority is limiting net GHG impacts in the energy and other natural resource sectors that supply fuels. Future work is needed to develop GHG management protocols for liquid fuel supply systems involving fungible commodities and dynamic global supply chains. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper reports the study and development case of an innovative application of the Cloud Manufacturing paradigm. Based on the definition of an appropriate web-based application, the infrastructure is able to connect the possible client requests and the relative supply chain prod-uct/process development capabilities and then attempt to find the best available solutions. In par-ticular, the main goal of the developed system, called AMSA (Additive Manufacturing Spare parts market Application), is the definition of a common platform to supply different kinds of services that have the following common reference points in the Additive Manufacturing Technologies (DFAM, Design For Additive Manufacturing): product development, prototypes, or small series production and reverse engineering activities to obtain Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models starting from a physical object. The definition of different kinds of services allows satisfying several client needs such as innovative product definition characterized by high performance in terms of stiffness/weight ratio, the possibility of manufacturing small series, such as in the motorsport field, and the possibility of defining CAD models for the obsolete parts for which the geometrical information is missed. The AMSA platform relies on the reconfigurable supply chain that is dynamic, and it depends on the client needs. For example, when the client requires the manufacture of a small series of a component, AMSA allows the technicians to choose the best solutions in terms of delivery time, price, and logistics. Therefore, the suppliers that contribute to the definition of the dynamic supply chain have an important role. For these reasons, the AMSA platform represents an important and innovative tool that is able to link the suppliers to the customers in the best manner in order to obtain services that are characterized by a high-performance level. Therefore, a provisional model has been implemented that allows filtering the technologies according to suitable performance in-dexes. A specific aspect for which AMSA can be considered unique is related with the given possibility to access Design for Additive Manufacturing Services through the Web in accordance with the possible additive manufacturing technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework for analyzing the relationships among Additive Manufacturing adoption, flexibility, and performance in the supply chain context. No empirical study was found in the supply chain literature that specifically examines the relationships among Additive Manufacturing adoption, flexibility and performance; the paper therefore fills an important gap in the supply chain literature. The research is based on a quantitative approach using a questionnaire survey from a total of 124 medium-and large-sized European Union automotive manufacturing companies. The hypothesized relationships are tested using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The research provides insights into how supply chain flexibility mediates the effect of Additive Manufacturing adoption on supply chain performance in the context of European automotive industry. Research findings indicate that Additive Manufacturing adoption positively impacts supply chain flexibility and that, in turn, supply chain flexibility positively impacts supply chain performance. This suggests that companies should focus on flexibilities in the supply chain to improve its performance. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the value of Additive Manufacturing adoption for supply chain flexibility and performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Subsidiaries of manufacturing companies operate as members of two distinct networks: the internal manufacturing network of the company and the external network of supply chain partners. Adapting the concept of “dual embeddedness” from international business literature to a manufacturing context, this paper proposes a model explaining the link between internal integration, external integration and operational performance. An international survey containing data on 470 manufacturing subsidiaries is used to operationalize the constructs. Structural equation modeling provides evidence for a full mediation model: external integration mediates the positive impact of internal integration on performance. Based on the results, it is put forward that knowledge generated within the internal manufacturing network can only be converted into subsidiary-level operational performance, if it is shared and recombined with external supply chain partners. The highest performance benefits can only be achieved if both suppliers and customers are involved in this process. A limitation of our approach is that knowledge flows are measured indirectly by assessing the level of integration of a subsidiary in the knowledge flows within the internal network, and the level of integration with suppliers and customers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: COVID-19 caused a highly uncertain environment and introduced a radical change in the airline industry. In that time, idle capacity due to drastic decline in passenger traffic, change in travel rules, and increases in air cargo demand have emerged as the main challenges. Effective responses to these issues became a fundamental requirement for airlines' survival and sustainability of supply chains. Organizational flexibility plays a vital role in dealing with those situations. Flexibility allows airline companies to adapt to changing environmental conditions and take advantage of opportunities. This study aims to explain the strategies of airline companies in Turkey to the COVID-19 crisis based on organizational flexibility. Methodology: This study is structured on the qualitative research method. We interviewed five experts and compiled information by reviewing various publications on COVID-19. We analyzed obtained information within the framework of organizational flexibility. Findings: The results indicated that airlines mitigate the effects of COVID-19, mostly through protective and exploitative maneuvers of organizational flexibility. Airlines focus more on cost reduction and saving strategies as protective maneuvers, while exploitative maneuvers focus more on the cargo market. Originality: This study is novel in that it examined airlines' responses to COVID-19 within the framework of organizational flexibility. © 2021 Proceedings of the Hamburg International Conference of Logistics.

Flexibility Requirements Profile (FRP) is an alternative approach to reduce this phenomenon and maintain a desired degree of variability in production plans. This study proposes a bi-objective optimization model, where plan stability would be incorporated as a second objective alongside the conventional cost objective. The trade-off between plan stability and production cost is analyzed through an experimental framework to find a compromise between these two conflicting interests. We also present a comparative study of costs and stability performances among the single objective FRP model, the bi-objective approach without FRP, and the combination of two methods.},

abstract={Due to short product life cycle, it is expedient to reconfiguration an existing supply chain from time to time. Companies need to impose the standards on operational units for finding the best or the near best alternative configuration. Thus, it becomes imperative to effectively adapt various enablers in a supply chain by understanding the dynamics between them that help to reconfigure a supply chain for high levels of performance. This paper presents an integration of agent-based simulation and decision tree learning as the data mining techniques to determine adaptive decisions of operational units of a mobile phone supply chain. Agent-based simulation output is subjected to data mining analysis to understand system behaviour in terms of interactions and the factors influencing the performance. An entropy-based formulation is proposed as the basis for comparing different operational units in the supply chain. The insights obtained are then encapsulated as operational rules and guidelines supporting better decision-making. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: Short product life cycle and/or mass customization necessitate reconfiguration of operational enablers of supply chain (SC) from time to time in order to harness high levels of performance. The purpose of this paper is to identify the key operational enablers under stochastic environment on which practitioner should focus while reconfiguring a SC network. Design/methodology/approach: The paper used interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach that presents a hierarchy-based model and the mutual relationships among the enablers. The contextual relationship needed for developing structural self-interaction matrix (SSIM) among various enablers is realized by conducting experiments through simulation of a hypothetical SC network. Findings: The research identifies various operational enablers having a high driving power towards assumed performance measures. In this regard, these enablers require maximum attention and of strategic importance while reconfiguring SC. Practical implications: ISM provides a useful tool to the SC managers to strategically adopt and focus on the key enablers which have comparatively greater potential in enhancing the SC performance under given operational settings. Originality/value: The present research realizes the importance of SC flexibility under the premise of reconfiguration of the operational units in order to harness high value of SC performance. Given the resulting digraph through ISM, the decision maker can focus the key enablers for effective reconfiguration. The study is one of the first efforts that develop contextual relations among operational enablers for SSIM matrix through integration of discrete event simulation to ISM. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Additive manufacturing (AM) in supply chain management (SCM) is one of the most emerging research topics nowadays, due to increased competition among manufacturing industries. AM techanology has capabilities to revolutionize manufacturing industry due to its huge advantages over traditional manufacturing (customized design, complex free and flexibility). AM technology provides small quantities of customized, personalized and geometrically complex products relatively at low cost as compared to traditional manufacturing. AM technology also provides customized shape, digital interaction with customers, direct manufacturing that give benefits in terms of lower cost, reduced supply chain complexity and lead times, etc. AM technology has been already adopted in fields of dental, biomedical, fashion and apparel due to its hyper flexibilities in supply chain. This review explores future scope, opportunities and challenges associated with supply chain management in adoption of AM technologies and also highlights the research gap by researchers from research background. AM technology is developing since 1980s and undergone huge transformation, but the integration of AM in supply chain is not explored so much. Therefore, this topic has good research scope. Systematic literature review has been done to find impacts (challenges, risks opportunities, advantages, etc.) of AM technologies on supply chain as well as future scope of AM in SCM. This review paper can serve as basis for future research related to this topic and add value to existing literature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={This paper proposes a multi-agent modelling approach that supports supply network configuration decisions towards sustaining operations excellence in terms of economic, business continuity and environmental performance. Two types of agents are employed, namely, physical agents to represent supply entities and auxiliary agents to deal with supply network configuration decisions. While using the evolutionary algorithm, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II to optimize both cost and lead time at the supply network level, agents are modelled with an architecture which consists of decision-making, learning and communication modules. The physical agents make decisions considering varying situations to suit specific product-market profiles thereby generating alternative supply network configurations. These supply network configurations are then evaluated against a set of performance metrics, including the energy consumption of the supply chain processes concerned and the transportation distances between supply entities. Simulation results generated through the application of this approach to a refrigerator production network show that the selected supply network configurations are capable of meeting intended sustainable goals while catering to the respective product-market profiles. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Distribution is a key factor for a company's profit as it directly impacts the overall supply chain cost. Location Routing Problem (LRP) is a well-known concept to reduce facility location and vehicle costs. Currently, the time aspect has been considered a lot in LRP to bring better service levels for a company as it shows how responsive a supply chain is. In completing service level objective, time windows have been used to measure whether the delivery is successful in the planned time or not. Moreover, LRP research has been advised to take on a multiple-objective approach, which are not available much. Therefore developing and testing a model with multiple objectives such as cost and service level is at most important. The model for this specific problem is designed and tested using exact goal programming method for small-case instance, i.e. 4 distribution centers and 8 retailers. This research has brought modeling of multi-objective location routing problem with time windows to minimize the total cost and maximize the service level (MOLRPTW-SL). It gives a set of solutions for deciding the right distribution center, vehicles, and routes depending on the scenario considered. The trade-off between cost and service level is also provided. © 2020 IEEE.},

Valid and reliable measures are developed for each dimension of SCF and global performance and hypotheses are tested using structural equation modeling. From a large sample survey (n= 105) of manufacturing firms launched upgrading program, results indicate a partial impact of supply chain flexibility on the global performance.

Huge efforts were made to outline effective methodologies both from computational and final solution quality perspective. However, besides being optimal, one major need of supply chains is flexibility and adaptability to disturbances. This research work aims at the definition of a thorough procedure for flexible supply chain design able to exploit deterministic and stochastic flexibility indices. The Traveling Deliveryman Problem was then selected as case study since it represents the most basic operational research problem. The adaptation of flexibility assessment methodologies, primarily conceived for unit operations, provides good results and allows to properly identify criticalities. In addition, it proves that the optimal solutions under uncertainty are confined to a limited subset among million possible alternatives according to the expected deviation nature. This procedure is then worth to be extended to more complex systems in future studies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The purpose of this paper is to develop a literature review of the major contributions of fuzzy logic in addressing uncertainty in supply chain risk management approaches. The results revealed that integration with disruptive analysis tools and multi-criteria decision-making methods are the most common types adopted, with the increasing trend of Petri nets and Bayesian approaches. The reviewed literature highlights some limitations related to the holistic complexity of risks in supply chains, the dynamic nature of the environment, and the reliability of the knowledge base in the assessment. In that sense, these observations reveal interesting future lines of research. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The nature of supply chains presents a variety of issues related to uncertainties. Under various uncertainties, risk management plays a crucial role in an effective supply chain decision-making. The uncertainty involved in the risk assessment process can be divided into two types: random uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Fuzzy theory has been applied to deal with uncertainties. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the role and contribution of the fuzzy logic in the treatment of epistemic uncertainty into supply chain risk management approaches. A literature review process was performed, followed by analysis and discussions on the examined topic. The results revealed that the integration with multicriteria decision-making and disruptive analysis methods are the most common types adopted, with trend to petri nets and multicriteria decision-making approaches. Supply risks are the most studied type and identification and assessment are the most developed processes in supply chain risk management. Although the publications on the subject has been highlighted, they present some limitations related to the holistic complexity of risks in supply chains, the dynamic nature of the environment and the reliability of the background knowledge in the assessment.

abstract={Recently, scholars identify the significance of accurately capturing what it means to be resilient and its implications for firms and supply chains. This research advances the understanding of resilience and empirically identifies its influence towards ‘bouncing back’ to the firms’ previous supply chain state or ‘bouncing forward’ through an evolution during and post-disruption. This research develops a theoretical resilience model grounded in TCE and Panarchy theory and tests its application through survey research and structural equation modelling across a mix of 15 industries with 298 supply chain professionals in the United States. This study finds that resilience leads to firms ‘bouncing back’ or returning to their pre-disruption state after a disruption has occurred. Consequently, managers can focus their cognitive capacity towards ‘bouncing back’ to the firm’s previous state following a disruption and not misappropriating resources towards long-term supply chain reconfiguration heroics. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={We consider financing and coordinating issues in a supply chain with one supplier (she) and one manufacturer (he), where the supplier is capital-constrained and her production yield is random. Facing shortage of capital, the supplier may use two financing sources to facilitate her production: bank loan from a commercial bank, or advance payment from the manufacturer. Taking the supply chain with centralized control as a benchmark, we analyze the optimal decisions of the two members in the supply chain. We find that in the optimal decisions, the supplier chooses only one, instead of a combination, of the two financing sources, and the manufacturer is always willing to pay in advance to finance the supplier's production. Furthermore, we propose to use the pay back contract (as well as cost-sharing contract as an extension) for the manufacturer to share the production risk and stimulate the supplier to improve the production yield. Finally, assuming the bargaining process of the supplier and the manufacturer being a Nash bargaining game, we show that the pay back contract under the two sources of financing (bank loan and advance payment) can coordinate the supply chain and flexibly allocate the total profit in the supply chain. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={At a high complexity in resource allocation such as raw materials, processing requirement, distribution policy and control, and even the handling of waste, a responsive-agro-industrial supply chains are required for multi-products operation. Moreover, competitive business environment with short turnover period, minimum cost and lead time, is the part of current challenge in designing and improving a responsive supply chain of agro-industrial products which are also in risk for declining quality. This paper discussed how a responsive the supplier selection answer for above challenges in terms of exact and crisp solutions which are harder to achieve. The decision making in selecting suppliers and obtaining raw material, in the case of responding the demand more quickly, facing several options and is a critical decision, is often based solely on the intuition of decision makers. An intuitionistic fuzzy hedge formulation and modeling were setup for obtaining rules to ensure and to allow supplier selection with the considerations of intuitionistic approach on relevant parameters. Modeling stage encompasses the determination of variables which influence the supplier selection, constructing membership and non-membership function in which the rule of the model affecting formulation of intuitionistic fuzzy hedges in details, rule construction and comparing verification result with conventional association rule mining (ARM). Computational results showed unique features and performance evaluation that treat intuitionist input of price, capacity, lead time, transportation costs, distance and demand for raw materials while supplier selection processes approved as flexible and adaptive, with the selected suppliers were S12, S5 and S8. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Interest in smart factories and smart supply chains has been increasing, and researchers have emphasized the importance and the effects of advanced technologies such as 3D printers, the Internet of Things, and cloud services. This paper considers an innovation in dynamic supply-chain design and operations: connected smart factories that share interchangeable processes through a cloud-based system for personalized production. In the system, customers are able to upload a product design file, an optimal supply chain design and operations plan are then determined based on the available resources in the network of smart factories. The concept of smart supply chains is discussed and six types of flexibilities are identified, namely: design flexibility, product flexibility, process flexibility, supply chain flexibility, collaboration flexibility, and strategic flexibility. Focusing on supply chain flexibility, a general planning framework and various optimization models for dynamic supply chain design and operations plan are proposed. Further, numerical experiments are conducted to analyze fixed, production, and transportation costs for various scenarios. The results demonstrate the extent of the dynamic supply chain design and operations problem, and the large variation in transportation cost. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Information management is a core supply chain activity that is increasing in importance as firms strive to become more responsive to growing customer demand for innovative products. However, effective processing of information from customers and suppliers remains a struggle for most firms. Absorptive capacity provides a useful view of information processing activities, but the current understanding of how firms use it to improve performance and why some firms seem to develop it while others do not remains unclear. This study is grounded in information processing theory, and examines the role of absorptive capacity in linking a firm's responsive strategy and performance. We test a structural equation model on data from 711 manufacturing firms, and validate our results on a second sample of 677 firms. Our study makes three major contributions by providing evidence that: (1) absorptive capacity is motivated by a firm's responsive strategy; (2) it fully mediates the relationship between responsive strategy and firm performance, indicating that absorptive capacity is a necessary competence for firms that aim to deliver innovative products to customers; and (3) the relationship between responsive strategy and absorptive capacity is U-shaped, indicating that when firms attempt to blend efficient and responsive strategies, their ability to develop absorptive capacity is diminished. © 2015 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.},

abstract={5G technology enables end-to-end connectivity in real time at a highly granular level along with the associated end-to-end visibility through the Internet-of-Everything. While some potential benefits of 5G for digital supply chain and operations management have been declared, literature is still silent about theoretical underpinning and structured conceptualisation of application areas, underlying implementation challenges, and the role of 5G in future transformations of value creation. This paper aims to offer some directions of how to close this research gap. We organise the discussion around five major capabilities of the digital supply chain and smart operations which can be enhanced by 5G, i.e. intelligence, visibility, transparency, dynamic networking, and connectivity. We delineate possible future research topics related to 5G in different areas of Industry 4.0-driven, digital supply chain and operations management which can be useful for researchers and practitioners alike when seeking to understand the impact of 5G on both short-term and long-term time scales. Our analysis encompasses both operational processes (e.g. transformations of manufacturing and warehouse operations by end-to-end connectivity of devices) and strategic perspectives (e.g. transformations of business models and supply network structures through end-to-end real-time visibility and connectivity of industry, public infrastructure, and consumers).

abstract={Currently, supply chains and manufacturing systems are changing based on the volatility in the current market landscape and shifts in digital technologies. The mass personalization trend is characterized by the ability to offer individualized products. Therefore, since customers are willing to pay over standard prices for individual products, companies have to redesign the processes along the supply network, focusing on higher adaptability, agility, and modularity. Furthermore, reconfigurable supply chain or X-network is a network designed in a cost efficient, responsive, sustainable, and resilient manner that is data driven and adaptable, in order to efficiently adjust supply chain capacities and functionality in response to the market volatility. Through the Industry 4.0 key technologies, improved flexibility can be achieved along with improved supply chain planning and controlling strategies.

abstract={Research on supply chain (SC) digitalization, resilience, sustainability and leagility has remarkably progressed, most of it focused on the individual contributions of these four major frameworks. However, a lack of integration spanning these individual frameworks can be observed. In this conceptual paper, we hypothesize that reconfigurability can be considered such an integral perspective that consolidates the research in SC adaptation to ever changing environments. We theorize a new notion – a Reconfigurable SC or the X-network–that exhibits some crucial design and control characteristics for complex value-adding systems in highly vulnerable environments. We support our argumentation and conceptual viewpoints by a literature analysis along with tertiary studies to review and structure contextual factors of designing the X-networks. We propose respective frameworks and discuss the implementation principles and technologies at the macro and micro levels. Two novel concepts–dynamic SC meta-structures and dynamic autonomous services–are introduced. Distinctively, we go beyond the existing knowledge to predict proactively the future directions in the reconfigurable SCs. Our results can be of value for decision-makers to decipher chances and barriers in contemporary SC transformations. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Climate change and global warming are having negative consequences for humans and nature. Manufacturing companies are particularly affected by the consequences of climate change. For example, extreme weather events can cause to production failure or even the collapse of entire supply chains. An adaptation to the impacts of climate change and the implementation of preventive measures requires an awareness and comprehensive knowledge in this topic. In the education of engineers in the field of factory planning and factory operation, the aspects of climate change and its consequences are not or only marginally considered. A systematic involvement in engineering education is shown in the paper. Through the use of innovative teaching methods of problem-based learning, awareness is created in order to effectively prepare manufacturing companies for the consequences of climate change in addition to the pure knowledge transfer. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={The closed-loop dynamics of sustainable supply chains play a key role in their performance, as the reverse flows of returns and remanufactured products entail new sources of uncertainty that alter the normal performance of the supply chain. However most of the studies assume a linear supply chain with a single reverse flow of returns, which is a simplification that may not hold in most of the existent supply chains, which often show more complex structures with several flows of returns. When there are several return flows, a critical decision for the supply chain dynamic performance is whether the remanufacturing process should be centralised (i.e. a single facility jointly remanufactures the returns from all the locations) or decentralised (i.e. the remanufacturing takes place independently in each location). This paper explores the impact of this critical decision on the performance of a divergent closed-loop supply chain with several point-of-sales and reverse flows. A simulation model is developed considering different return rates, information transparency levels, and number of nodes in the supply chain. Findings reveal that a centralized configuration reduces the uncertainty in the reverse flows of remanufactured products, smoothing the production orders of the involved organizations and improving their inventory performance. As a drawback, upstream members of the supply chain may face a higher uncertainty due to some correlation of orders. As such, this configuration may not be recommended in long supply chains with a significant number of return flows and high average return volumes, unless there is a high transparency of information. Furthermore, guidelines for managers are provided in order to reduce the bullwhip effect when implementing these circular economy practices. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Greater use of multimodal transportation can substantially improve the environmental performance of freight transportation. Despite strenuous efforts by public policy-makers to alter the freight modal split, most companies still rely heavily on road transportation, and modal shifts to rail and water have remained modest at best. In this paper we argue that this is partly the result of a failure to take a holistic supply chain view of the modal shift process. Synchromodality provides a framework within which shippers can manage their supply chains more flexibly to increase the potential for shifting mode. On the basis of a literature review, we broaden the conventional focus of multimodal transportation to give it a supply chain dimension, and propose the concept of ‘Synchromodality from a Supply Chain Perspective’ (SSCP). Using a case study we show that when the supply chain impacts are taken into account, it is possible to significantly increase the share of intermodal rail transportation within a corridor, without necessarily increasing total logistics cost or reducing the service level. In this way the environmental impact of freight activities can be significantly reduced. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Globalization is now acted everywhere in the world as an important and economic reason for company improvement. It is clear that company supply chain could be optimized for insuring customer satisfaction. Due to low cost of labor force in emerging countries, companies in developed countries have to reorganizing themselves for being competitive. Industry 4.0 and supply chain 4.0 are the results of this crucial desire of better performance. A company has to integrate new technological concepts and digitalization on its supply chain in order to reduce cost and increase product quality. Despite the great and positive impact on large companies, these concepts are not already integrated into small and medium enterprises (SMEs). They considered industry 4.0 and supply chain 4.0 concepts as a dream, thus they are not ready to use them for increasing their performance. The use of complex system modelling and multi-criteria analysis allow to define an adapted framework specially destined to SMEs improvement according to supply 4.0 concepts. In addition to technological and digital parameters, social, societal and environmental dimensions are integrated in this vision. Sustainability is considered as important for supply chain performance. The idea is to measure the dynamic of supply chain 4.0 and Industry 4.0 concepts implementation in SMEs, to find brakes and to define action plan for accelerating this dynamic. This paper focuses on this approach destined to SMEs. A reference model is being developed for metallurgic SMEs by using Case Based Reasoning (CBR) and generalization reasoning. Then, a real case is shown for illustrating the approach. Perspectives are exposed for according to the development of a software collaborative, co-creative and co-innovative tool for adapting SME performance according to supply chain 4.0 concepts and taking into account sustainability. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Change drivers across supply chains arise either from the production area or from the goods circulation area. A change in production can have a stronger impact on supply chains than a change in goods circulation. In particular, innovations inspired by sustainable development concerns which are firstly introduced within the production system, as some authors point out [Blanquart et al. (2008)], may greatly influence logistical organizations. Their introduction within supply chains requires more time [Roussat and Fabbe-Costes (2014)]. Change drivers may be institutional, commercial, technical, or managerial. Their types and features vary across periods and industries. Some may have quick-impact consequences, others will be slow in showing their effects on the whole supply chain. Three types of change drivers are currently main issues when consumer goods are concerned. Measures for preserving natural resources, with waste management and recycling of end-of-life products in order to minimize the consumption of non renewable resources, make up the first type of drivers. The second type is the ever wider use of online purchases, which disturbs B to B and B to C relationships as well as urban logistics and the last mile delivery terms. Thirdly, changes in logistical organizations of mass retailers may direct traffic flows via new logistics hubs. Food products are concerned by these change drivers in a specific way. Although some of them such as schools of fish may be renewable, natural resources must be protected. Reverse logistics processes are mainly confined to packaging because of the very nature of food. Distance purchases are steadily rising. While the market dependency upon mass retail firms is high, short supply circuits relying on local producers also attract consumers. Within the agri-food sector, the industry of fishery and aquaculture products is a major one feeding billion people around the world. In Europe, it employs approximately 267 000 full time equivalent workers [European Union (2014)], provides activity for hundreds of seaports, and positively contributes to local economies in peripheral shore areas. The paper therefore focuses on the situation of fishery and aquaculture products. The analysis highlights the situation of the whole supply chain within this specific food industry, allowing to achieve a non-fragmented view of it. It also clarifies, from a qualitative viewpoint, the respective role of sustainable development-based change drivers and the others, allowing to point out those giving impetus to changes. The analysis relies on a survey of academic literature and specialized publications, and on interviews with experts and key market players. It highlights the specific adaptations of supply chains within this valuable industry fully integrated in a global business world. It points out the first impacts of sustainable development concern decisions compared with those of other change drivers and illustrates how both kinds of impact interact to shape supply chain schemes. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Technology centered businesses are highly motivated and accepted in the present Information age. More organizations are trying to inculcate ICT in their daily operations and making their business leaner and flexible. But technology adaptation comes with a cost (Short term/long term). Brick and Click Retail formats like hypermarkets, specialty stores and convenient stores are using technological platform for widening their reach to the customer. Internet of Things (IoT) is a commonly noted technology, specially in European markets. Mostly three layers of IoTs are used in Organizations. Convenient stores (smallest retail format) is prone to use three layered IoT system for the operations as it is less expensive and the current business requires minimum flexibility. Specialty stores go for five layer IoT since the organization size is small as compared to Hypermarkets and they require next level flexibility than convenient stores. Hypermarkets have high budget for technology incubation and require point to point communication and high level of flexibility because of their reach in diverse region, hence they go for seven layered IoT. This piece of research tries to show the relationship between the cost and the strategy of a retail format with the adaptation of IoT in their operations. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={Whether to use an information sharing mechanism is investigated in a dynamic supply chain, where one manufacturer, one carrier, and one retailer are faced with uncertain yield, demand, and lead time during multiple periods. Each member is modeled as an adaptive agent based on multiagent technique, and their decisions can be adjusted timely to adapt to external environment. There are two choices for the whole supply chain to deal with uncertain risks: information sharing (IS) or no information sharing (NS). Under strategy IS, the information about market demand and the retailer's inventory can be shared within the supply chain. For each strategy, the effects of yield, demand, and lead time uncertainties on costs of the supply chain and channel members are studied. It is found that (i) it is rewarding for the upstream manufacturer to use a retailer's shared information under uncertain yield or demand; (ii) however, information sharing (IS) strategy sometimes should be abandoned for other members and the whole supply chain; (iii) counterintuitively, the increase of transportation time uncertainty benefits the retailer. © 2019 Heng Du and Ye Jiang.},

abstract={This paper examines a manufacturer's supply management strategies for mitigating yield risk in a complex dynamic supply chain. Two strategies can be adopted for the manufacturer: backup and reliability improvement. Consumers may select to leave (instant consumers) or wait (delaying consumers) when they confront the manufacturer's insufficient inventory. Utilizing the method of multi-agent modeling, a manufacturer and a supplier are modeled as the intelligent agents with the reinforcement learning behavior. The study shows that: 1) when the number of instant consumers is small, reliability improvement strategy should be selected; otherwise, the manufacturer should adopt a backup strategy; 2) only when mean yield is large enough, reliability improvement strategy is the optimal choice; and 3) if yield uncertainty is small, the manufacturer should choose reliability improvement strategy; otherwise, it is suitable to use a backup strategy. In addition, when the main supplier can determine its own wholesale price, it is found that: 1) when the mean yield is small, a lower wholesale price should be designed for the main supplier, to induce higher order quantity under backup strategy; and 2) the impact of yield uncertainty on the manufacturer's supply management strategy can be changed by the main supplier's adaptive pricing behavior. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to industrialization and informatization of the construction industry, prefabricated construction has attracted wide attention from both research and practitioner communities. In prefabricated construction, there are exacting requirements for information sharing. Also, data in a prefabricated component supply chain tend to be dispersed in design, production, transportation and other stages. In other words, such data are significantly multi-source heterogeneous. Without an effective way of participating in supply chain dynamic collaboration, decision-making at various stages and resource allocation can be extremely challenging. This paper proposes a decision support framework for prefabricated component supply chain based on ontology and multi-agent. The framework comprises the ontology layer (i.e. provides data support for the model), the agent interaction layer (i.e. serves as the communication hub to coordinate the data transmission between modules), and the agent simulation layer (i.e. simulates interaction behavior of participants, and supports decision making). Using the Shanghai Chenxiang Road Station complex project as a case study, the paper demonstrates the validity of the proposed ontology and multi-agent based decision support framework. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Even though researchers have immensely contributed in the field of supply chain agility, supply chain adaptability and supply chain alignment, their impact on humanitarian supply chain performance and their relationship is not well known. Leadership is the most discussed and one of the most debated dimensions and little is known about leadership integration with a humanitarian supply chain network design. We carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify variables and their items to design a structured questionnaire, which was pretested with experts in the humanitarian supply chain. We conducted an empirical study on a sample of 306 responses that were collected by us during Allahabad Kumbh from senior officials of the police department, Indian Railways, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation and third-party logistics (3PL) companies. We have used the exploratory factor analysis followed by the confirmatory factor analysis to check the construct validity of scales and goodness of fit. We further tested our hypotheses using regression analysis and mediation effect using Baron and Kenny’s (1986) proposed steps. We further checked the mediation significance using the Sobel test. We found that supply chain alignment is a strong determinant of logistics performance and human performance. The supply chain agility is found to completely mediate between supply chain adaptability and human performance and partially mediate between supply chain adaptability and logistics performance. Leadership has a partial mediation effect between supply chain alignment and human performance. © 2015, © 2015 IMI.},

abstract={There is growing interest among researchers in the concept of sustainability. Large commercial corporations have also shown responsibility for preserving planet and people while maintaining profit. Our present paper is motivated by the three P’s—people, planet, and profit. In our paper, we have attempted to develop a responsive sustainable supply chain network which can respond to a certain degree of uncertainty due to uncontrollable forces. We have developed a model using robust optimization based on three well-known robust counterpart optimization formulations. Finally, this paper compares the results of the three formulations using different test scenarios and parameter-sensitive analysis in terms of final output, CPU time, the level of conservatism, the degree of closeness to the ideal solution, the degree of balance involved in developing a compromise solution, and satisfaction degree. Two further questions related to environmental dimensions and social dimensions have been investigated using an appreciative inquiry, a quasi-ethnographic study. In this way, we have embraced mixed research design to address our research questions. We have extended past research by incorporating uncertainty in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and qualitative research methods to fill the voids. We have concluded our research with limitations of our present study and outlined further research directions. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={Purpose: The implementation of continuous processing technologies for pharmaceutical manufacturing has increased due to its potential to enhance supply chain flexibility, reduce the footprint of the manufacturing facility, and deliver more consistent quality. Additionally, it facilitates extensive, real-time monitoring by sensors and process analytical technology (PAT) tools without perturbing the process. In the presented case study, the use of multivariate tools for the real-time monitoring and retrospective review of a continuous active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) synthesis was evaluated from process development through to commercialization. Method: A multivariate statistical process monitoring (MSPM) approach summarizing variability in both quality critical (controlled flow rates, temperatures) and non-quality critical parameters (pressures, pump speeds, conductivity) was used to monitor three telescoped chemistry stages of a continuous API synthesis. Four different modeling strategies were presented addressing specific monitoring and analysis requirements during the pharmaceutical development lifecycle. Results: During development (R&D and commercial facility), the implemented multivariate monitoring resulted in the identification of potential failure modes, a deeper understanding of the natural process variability and accelerated root cause analysis for a recurrent reagent blockage. During manufacturing (commercial facility), the multivariate tool confirmed potential for predictive maintenance and early fault detection. Conclusions: While the implemented control strategy based on parametric control and offline analytical testing provided the required quality assurance, the multivariate trends provided additional information on process performance. More specifically, they enabled more detailed process understanding during the development of the continuous API synthesis following quality by design (QbD) principles and demonstrated the potential for enhanced process performance during commercial manufacturing. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Over the years, supply chain reconfiguration decisions have been solely based on operational risk. Simplification strategies, such as horizontal mergers, and networking strategies, such as risk pooling, are conflicting paradigms that have been shown to improve financial performance of supply partners. The implication of this to disruption risk is not fully known, especially as it concerns information security breach (ISB). Analysts have rated ISB as a huge disruption risk, costing businesses millions of dollars. Using a credible and well-established agent-based simulation approach and statistical analysis, we examine the impact of ISB on the simplification and risk pooling strategies respectively under three different order replenishment systems. The effect of reconfiguring the supply chain is first examined in a non-security breach scenario and then in a breached scenario. We find that reconfiguration has no benefit to a supply chain using a parameter based replenishment policy (option I), in both breach and non-breach situations, but leads to significant advantage when batch ordering model (option II) or a combined batch-and-parameter based ordering policy (option III) is used. We also established that batch ordering system favours the risk pooling strategy whereas a combined batch-and-parameter ordering system favours the simplification counterpart especially when the simplification is at the wholesaler tier. This study has significant implications for supply chain design as well as information security priorities. This is one of the first papers to look at how ISB impacts supply chain configuration and the role of ordering decision context. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents a framework of smart real-time performance monitoring and controlling of next-generation supply chains. It is based on enabling a set of Internet-of- Things (IoT) functions across the supply chain for dynamic and intelligent information processing and performance management. This is realized through the utilization of IoT technology in conjunction with workflow modeling to address the dynamic aspects of supply chain in a real-time environment. The proposed mechanism is referred to as Dynamic Supply Chain Performance Management (DSCPM) which is a computerized event-driven system that runs in real-time, monitors a set of selected supply chain performance measures, and effectively enables real-time decision-making. DSCPM functionality is based on the concepts of Complex Event Processing (CEP) to manage the massive event-instances across the supply chain and to convert them into beneficial information. Adopting DSCPM is expected to facilitate realtime corrective actions that reduce wastes and costs and maximize value across the supply chain. © 2018 IEEE.},

To prevent this issue, a DNDEA model based on the free disposal hull (FDH) approach is developed. For the first time, this paper develops a DNDEA version of the free disposal hull (FDH) model in the context of the SCOR framework. It is also shown that this model always presents a finite efficiency score for assessing the sustainability of supply chains. Moreover, using this model, real benchmarks can be calculated to improve the sustainability of unsustainable supply chains. A case study in print industry is given.

Based on a sample of 143 German firms, we empirically investigate the effects of supply chain agility and supply chain adaptability on cost performance and operational performance using hierarchical regression analysis. We ground our investigation in the dynamic capabilities view and contingency theory. We find that supply chain agility and supply chain adaptability positively affect both cost performance and operational performance. We further find evidence for a mediating role of supply chain agility in the links between supply chain adaptability and performance. Product complexity positively moderates the links between supply chain adaptability and cost performance, and supply chain adaptability and operational performance. The results contribute to the literature by offering a more nuanced understanding of the performance implications of supply chain agility and supply chain adaptability, thereby addressing the crucial question of why their benefits may or may not materialise under varying levels of product complexity. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

This study presents an investigation of the linkages between BDA capabilities, circular economy (CE) practices, and sustainable supply chain (SSC) flexibility on the SSC performance. Based on a survey of 320 manufacturing organisations, the study presents very interesting results. It is revealed that the BDA does not have a direct effect on sustainable performance. The CE practices and SSC flexibility are significant mediating variables between the BDA capabilities and SSC performance. The BDA is found to drive the implementation of CE practices. Further, CE practices are found to develop SSC flexibility with the BDA complementing these flexibilities. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) was a challenging milestone construction project that boosted the Hong Kong construction industry participants to new heights of recognition. While industry-boosting long-term benefits arose from knowledge gained in managing specialist prefabrication processes and complex supply chains (SCs), these advances also necessarily imposed challenges, rendering the project highly vulnerable to disruptions. Therefore, higher resilience was essential to withstand higher Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (SCV) through enhanced capabilities, for which identifying dynamic SCV becomes critical. To address this, the study employed the Topic Over Time modelling approach to detect critical SCV using 1,748 unstructured official documents on the HZMB from 2003 to 2018 (project design to handover). The popularity trend analysis that was thereby conducted, enabled identifying the six most critical vulnerabilities and categorizing them among each project phase. Finally, an ex-post vulnerability evaluation map was developed by considering the vulnerabilities' popularity trend and their relevance towards the project and SC phases. Using these findings, industry practitioners could improve their ex-ante decision-making, targeting value-enhanced-resilient SCs in future prefabricated infrastructure development projects. Further, the text-mining research approach unveils an effective mechanism for researchers to extract dynamic empirical clues from a large unstructured set of documents in construction SCs. © 2021 Proceedings of the 37th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2021.

abstract={Prefabricated construction as a preferred construction approach instigated significant technological advancements in construction supply chains in Hong Kong (HK). The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) was a milestone prefabricated construction project which was successfully constructed using these industrial advancements. However, the project itself was a great challenge as it was highly vulnerable to disruptions due to complex supply chain processes. In this regard, increased resilience could be the key to boosting project performance through enhanced Supply Chain Capabilities (SCCs), where identifying SCC dynamics becomes essential. Therefore, this study employed the Topic Over Time Modeling approach to detect critical SCCs using 1,748 unstructured official documents on the HZMB from 2003 to 2018, which spans the period from project design to handover. The popularity trend analysis of texts enabled identifying the six most critical capabilities associated with each construction phase of planning, construction and handover. Thereafter, an ex-post capability evaluation map was developed by considering the popularity trend of capabilities and their relevance to different project phases. Industry practitioners would benefit from prior knowledge of SCCs and their dynamic impact on each project phase to prioritize initiating them adequately and appropriately, targeting value-enhanced-resilient supply chains in ex-ante decision-making of future prefabricated infrastructure development projects. Further, the text-mining research approach unveils to academia, an effective and novel mechanism to extract dynamic empirical clues from a large unstructured set of documents in construction SCC analysis research. © 2021, Ceylon Institute of Builders.

abstract={Germany and the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia (the CE4) have been in a process of deepening economic integration which has lead to the development of a dynamic supply chain within Europe-the Germany-Central European Supply Chain (GCESC). Model-based simulations suggest two key policy implications: first, as a reflection of strengthening trade linkages, German fiscal spillovers (stemming from higher public consumption) to the CE4 and more broadly to the rest of the euro area, have increased over time, but are still relatively small. This is explained by the supply chain nature of trade integration: final demand in Germany is not necessarily the main determinant of CE4 exports to Germany. Second, increased trade openness in both Germany and the CE4 implies a greater exposure of the GCESC to global shocks. However, owing to its strong fundamentals-including sound balance sheets and its safe haven status-Germany plays the role of a regional anchor of stability by better absorbing shocks from other trading partners instead of amplifying their transmission across the GCESC. © 2015 International Monetary Fund.},

abstract={The Covid-19 pandemic has affected supply chains around the world, it has tested the true resilience of businesses in every sector. Emerging economies are not as developed in supply chain management as developed economies and the pandemic severely affected numerous economic sectors resulting in devastating economic performance. This research focuses on examining how the regular supply chain management practices (SCMPs) have impacted the supply chain flexibility with supply chain risk management culture as a moderating variable during the pandemic. This study was conducted through an online based questionnaire. Data were collected from 283 manufacturing companies that presented different industrial sectors in Egypt. The data was analysed using partial least squares technique. The results indicated that strategic supplier partnership, customer relationship practices and information sharing are the three SCMPs which positively affect supply chain flexibility. Moreover, the supply chain risk management culture positively moderated the impact of strategic supplier partnership, customer relationship practices and information sharing on supply chain flexibility.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how first-tier suppliers in multi-tier supply chains adapt their vertical and horizontal relationships to reduce the risk of slavery-like practices. Design/methodology/approach: Using Archer’s morphogenetic theory as an analytical lens, this paper presents case analyses adduced from primary and secondary data related to the development of relational anti-slavery supply capabilities in Brazilian–UK beef and timber supply chains. Findings: Four distinct types of adaptation were found among first-tier suppliers: horizontal systemisation, vertical systemisation, horizontal transformation and vertical differentiation. Research limitations/implications: This study draws attention to the socially situated nature of corporate action, moving beyond the rationalistic discourse that underpins existing research studies of multi-tier, socially sustainable, supply chain management. Cross-sector comparison highlights sub-country and intra-sectoral differences in both institutional setting and the approaches and outcomes of individual corporate actors’ initiatives. Sustainable supply chain management theorists would do well to seek out those institutional entrepreneurs who actively reshape the institutional conditions within which they find themselves situated. Practical implications: Practitioners may benefit from adopting a structured approach to the analysis of the necessary or contingent complementarities between their, primarily economic, objectives and the social sustainability goals of other, potential, organizational partners. Social implications: A range of interventions that may serve to reduce the risk of slavery-like practices in global commodity chains are presented. Originality/value: This paper presents a novel analysis of qualitative empirical data and extends understanding of the agential role played by first-tier suppliers in global, multi-tier, commodity, supply chains. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: Analysis is grounded on a case study of organizing the import of machine parts from Shanghai, China, to Norway. An analytical framework is developed through a literature review on long linked supply chains, big data and risk management. Findings: Analysis reveals that big data use in this scenario encompasses mainly around handling risks associated with transformations in the supply chain, a data-driven approach. Complexity is founded in transformation – the flows of goods and information. Supply chain dynamics represent an important source for data acquisition for big data analytics. Research limitations/implications: The qualitative nature of the study limits the aim of generalization. An alternative view of big data as process is discussed and proposed, adapted to supply chain management and industrial marketing functionality.

abstract={An ambitious 10-year collaborative program is described to invent, design, demonstrate, and support commercialization of integrated biopharmaceutical manufacturing technology intended to transform the industry. Our goal is to enable improved control, robustness, and security of supply, dramatically reduced capital and operating cost, flexibility to supply an extremely diverse and changing portfolio of products in the face of uncertainty and changing demand, and faster product development and supply chain velocity, with sustainable raw materials, components, and energy use. The program is organized into workstreams focused on end-to-end control strategy, equipment flexibility, next generation technology, sustainability, and a physical test bed to evaluate and demonstrate the technologies that are developed. The elements of the program are synergistic. For example, process intensification results in cost reduction as well as increased sustainability. Improved robustness leads to less inventory, which improves costs and supply chain velocity. Flexibility allows more products to be consolidated into fewer factories, reduces the need for new facilities, simplifies the acquisition of additional capacity if needed, and reduces changeover time, which improves cost and velocity. The program incorporates both drug substance and drug product manufacturing, but this paper will focus on the drug substance elements of the program. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Industry 4.0 digital technologies are becoming indispensable for firms striving to enhance their supply chain capabilities and financial performance, but how these relationships play out in practice remains unclear. To address this issue, this study assesses the relationship between supply chain integration, supply chain agility, and financial performance from a dynamic capability perspective. Further analyses are conducted to establish whether Industry 4.0 digital technologies moderate the association between (a) supply chain integration and supply chain agility and (b) supply chain agility and financial performance. Findings based on the data pertaining to a sample of 274 Swedish manufacturing firms indicate that supply chain agility fully mediates the link between supply chain integration and financial performance. However, while Industry 4.0 digital technologies strengthen the effect of supply chain agility on financial performance, they do not moderate the relationship between supply chain integration and supply chain agility. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate regarding how digital technologies play a role in achieving competitive advantage in interplay with dynamic capabilities related to the supply chain. These findings are relevant for decision-makers, as they address the need for organisational adjustments beyond the mere introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies to fully reap their benefits. © 2021 The Author(s).

Uncertainty in the supply chain may arise from a number of sources such as demand and supply interruptions and lead time variability.

This paper develops such a tactical supply chain planning model incorporating a realistic range of flexibility options.

The utility of the proposed model and solution method is evaluated using data from an empirical case study.

abstract={Many industrial firms adopted a deterministic irreversible investment plans without any pro-active risk management strategy. The existing literature of the Supply Chain Design does not value the managerial flexibility as enabled by the Real Option (RO) theory. However, this latter considers only single project and not adapted to supply chain investments. This opens a new area of research. Thus, this paper is concerned with providing a practical and novel framework for de-risking future investments of large-scale, capital-intensive interdependent industrial projects, in an uncertain and risky environment. The suggested framework is based on real option analysis and aims to integrate managerial flexibility in terms of “real options” to efficiently adjust the investment plans to the evolution of uncertainties over time, considering interdependencies between projects, while reducing downside risks and increasing potential opportunities. This framework has been tested to assess potential risks, define and value flexible strategies to deal with the construction delays and the cost overruns in the investment planning of phosphates fertilizer firm. The insights indicate that flexibility lead to higher expected performance while reducing downside risks and raising potential upside gains. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={In the context of a dynamic and hypercompetitive business environment, effective supply chain design helps organisations to align resources for improved flow of products and services and satisfy customers’ diverse needs. Scholars have proposed several mutually exclusive supply chain designs such as efficient versus responsive, and lean versus agile. Quantitative testing has revealed that supply chain designs of many firms do not match with what was conceptually expected. To address this mismatch, in this study, a new approach to supply chain leagility is introduced and the impact of uncertainty as the key design driver of supply chains on leagility is investigated. The partial least squares (PLS) was employed to analyse data collected from 299 Australian firms by administering a structured questionnaire. Results indicate that higher performance is achievable on minimising the deviation from a balanced supply chain in which aspects of both leanness and agility are equally embedded. Further, the level of uncertainty directly and positively affects the Deviation from Leagility (DFL) index. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The proposed model also incorporates other aspects of real world supply chains such as multiple transport lot sizing and flexible holding capacity of warehouses. A solution methodology, the Nested Integrated Cross-Entropy (NICE) method, is developed to solve the proposed mixed-integer nonlinear mathematical model. The application of the model and solution method is investigated in an actual case problem. Analysis of the numerical results focuses on investigating the relationship between lean practices and green outcomes. We find that (1) not all lean interventions at the tactical supply chain planning level result in green benefits, and (2) a flexible supply chain is the greenest and most efficient alternative when compared to strictly lean and centralized situations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The efficient design of the supply chain network is crucial for good performance and robust functionality. In this paper, the facility location-allocation problem, in the strategic stage of supply chain design, is considered. The problem is studied for a 4-layer supply chain network; suppliers, plants, distribution centers, and demand points (customers). Location decisions are considered in 2 layers; plants and distribution centers. The problem model addresses inventory levels, flow of products, and positions of the customer order decoupling point (CODP), in a multi-period (dynamic) planning horizon. In an earlier study, the problem was formulated as a non-linear integer programming model with a profit maximization objective. In this sequel paper, a solution algorithm is developed to solve the problem based on the successive shortest path (SSP) algorithm. A computational study is conducted, and it shows that the SSP algorithm performs well regarding solution quality and computational time. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This case study explores the bullwhip effect phenomenon and mitigation in supply chain process at Transborder Logistic Canada. Despite being one of the largest logistic chains of Canada, Transborder for two years was facing challenges and problem in shape of bullwhip effects. To add further to the firm's problem there is no ownedwarehouse to manage its inventories. The theoretical framework for present case study is based on the theory of Lee (1977) to overcome the problems in the supply chain process. Moreover, the steps of Hussain and Drake (2011) are considered to overcome the bullwhip effects, challenges of cost control, response time, risk management, and effective warehouse management. "Realism" is the research philosophy undertaken to develop a cross-sectional research design to investigate the research problem at hand. Hypothetico-inductivedeductive model is used to explore research variables. Moreover, researcher used mixed method approach by circulating matrix based semi-structured survey questionnaire in different interlinked departments of Transborder Agency. The questionnaire is based on LIKERT Scale (1-to5) rating. In addition to that, openended interviews with the head and subordinates of various departments were commenced to explore qualitative aspects related to research problem. Results revealed that logistic firm rely heavily on demand-forecasting information through customers. There was fluctuation in demand order along with order batching, demand forecast updating, rationing and shortage game, and price fluctuation. The Polar diamond approach is considered by Transborder to effectively and efficiently deal with problem at hand and challenges that are hindering the supply chain process. Moreover, VMI, EDI, and POS are tools and techniques used to resolve different types of challenges and find a long term proper rational solution to bullwhip effect (problem at hand). Moreover, findings revealed that However, there is still need for effective warehouse management which can be done through developing strategic alliance with various partners across the globe and undertaking the software inventory system to manage things in correct manner. Logistic supply chain inefficiency is mainly caused by bullwhip effect. The rational adoption of model can assist supply chain managers to be proactive in approach. Moreover, the rational decision can help in identification of problem at early stage and help the firm to efficiently overcome the problem. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

In order to cope with unexpected events like natural or man-made disasters, flexible international long-distance transportation modes and postponement strategies are taken into account in our supply chain model. In order to balance supply chain costs and the flexibility of supply chains, a two-stage multi-scenario stochastic programming model is developed where the stochastic events are represented by corresponding scenarios. High quality solutions of all our problem instances are generated by using a Python based stochastic programming framework to solve the model.

abstract={This paper investigates the application of diverse transportation modes for a global supply chain (SC) in stochastic environments. The motivation of our paper is to investigate the idea of enabling a global flexible SC with disruptive risks in making it less vulnerable by applying diverse transportation modes which is also our first contribution. The flexibility stems from the fact that transportation modes with a low-speed transportation contain latent time buffers that can be used by accelerating transport activities. This represents a promising approach to make supply chains (SCs) more flexible and to establish an additional degree of freedom in order to manage stochastic events like minor disruptions or serious catastrophes. In this paper, a stochastic programming model for a multi-stage multi-product SC is developed. SC partners, including multiple suppliers, a processing center, two assembling centers, multiple distribution centers and retailers, are incorporated into the model. The second contribution of this paper is that different types of possible future catastrophic disruptions are quantified and included in the model. SC catastrophic disruptions like transportation delays or the fact that a SC node is disrupted by a serious catastrophe are stochastic factors of our model. The model is solved by using PySP, a specific modeling and stochastic programming framework. In order to show the quality of solutions of the stochastic programming model (SP solutions), a large amount of scenarios is generated to simulate the real case for each instance. The expected SC costs for these scenarios will be evaluated based on SP solutions and wait-and-see solutions, which are benchmarks. In addition, decision makers with neutral, optimistic and pessimistic attitudes regarding the occurrence of disruptions are also simulated and evaluated in the computational experiments. Managerial insights are concluded from computational results. The most important conclusion is that proper transportation mode planning enables a flexible global supply chain. Further conclusions like the quality of stochastic solutions and solutions of simulating decision makers with neutral, optimistic and pessimistic attitudes, as well as the most beneficial transportation modes in SCs with uncertain environments are proposed based on the computational results. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Findings – Different supply chain terminologies – such as adaptive supply chain network, best value supply chain, and open inter-organizational system – partially draw upon the basic premises of an open system. The relative openness of a supply chain and, consequently, the dynamics of different supply chain attributes remain understudied. This supports the idea that an open system perspective of the supply chain is imperative to improve the understanding of the influence of supply chain openness on organizational performance. Originality/value – The conceptual framework posits that different supply chain attributes affect the openness of supply chain to a varying degree which ultimately influences the organizational performance.

abstract={Worldwide competition originated the development of integrated supply chains (SCs) that are distributed manufacturing systems integrating international logistics and information technologies with production. This paper develops a decision-making model based on discrete consensus in order to assign tasks to each actor of the SC at the operational level. In particular, some actors of the SC generate tasks that other actors, localized in a downstream stage, have to complete. We provide a novel distributed algorithm that aims to minimize the task costs assuming that each actor can perform a subset of the available tasks and can communicate with a subset of actors. In order to show the effectiveness of the distributed algorithm, a case study is considered. The problem is formalized as a distributed consensus algorithm, i.e., as a procedure using which the agents of the SC can exchange messages and update autonomously and iteratively their assigned tasks. Some results prove that the convergence to a task assignment consensus is reached in finite time and a stopping criterion is provided. © 2012 IFAC.},

abstract={An extensive literature review by Simangunsong et al. (2012) identifies as many as fourteen sources of supply chain uncertainty. Christopher and Lee (2004) find it difficult for supply chains to be efficient if they are highly exposed to risk and uncertainty. The authors further argue that risks reduce the confidence of managers in supply chains and hence increase the expected loss of performance. Supply chain flexibility is the ability of the partners in the chain to respond to disruptions efficiently with minimum loss of performance. The majority of academic work on manufacturing and supply chain flexibility describes flexibility as a response to, or a means to cope with, uncertainty (Upton, 1995; Bertrand, 2003; Sheffiand Rice, 2005). Literature also establishes a positive linkage between flexibility and performance. The present paper, a portion of a larger study conducted by the author, investigates the role of supply chain flexibility in reducing the impact of uncertainties on performance in the automotive supply chains in India. Automotive supply chains are among the most complicated chains to manage because of the involvement of enormous number of suppliers and the associated uncertainties. In the recent past, automotive industry in India and in other parts of the world has experienced loss in performance due to disruptions from within and outside the chains. The Indian auto industry has a share of around 5-6 per cent in the country's GDP, which is further expected to go up to 10 per cent in the year 2016 (AMA, 2006). Manufacturers of auto components operating at tier 1 and tier 2 levels of various supply chains in the industry are considered as the primary unit of analysis. A structured questionnaire was administered to manufacturers of auto components using convenience sampling method. The relationship between flexibility and performance in the presence of uncertainty has been examined using correlation and regression methods. The study confirms the negative impact of uncertainty on performance and also that flexibility and uncertainty co-varies but in different directions. This implies that flexibility reduces the impact of uncertainty. However, performance is found to be positively linked with flexibility. © IEOM Society International. © IEOM Society International.},

In this paper, a multi-agent cyber-physical system (CPS) architecture with radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is presented to assist inter-layer interactions between different manufacturing phases on the shop floor and external interactions with other stakeholders within a supply chain. A dynamic simulation model in the AnyLogic software is developed to implement the CPS-RFID solution by using the agent-based technique. A case study from cryogenic warehousing in cell and gene therapy has been chosen to test the validity of the presented CPS-RFID architecture.

abstract={We address the dynamic design of supply chain networks in which the moments of demand distribution function are uncertain and facilities’ availability is stochastic because of possible disruptions. To incorporate the existing stochasticity in our dynamic problem, we develop a multi-stage stochastic program to specify the optimal location, capacity, inventory, and allocation decisions. Further, a data-driven rolling horizon approach is developed to use observations of the random parameters in the stochastic optimization problem. In contrast to traditional stochastic programming approaches that are valid only for a limited number of scenarios, the rolling horizon approach makes the determined decisions by the stochastic program implementable in practice and evaluates them. The stochastic program is presented as a quadratic conic optimization, and to generate an efficient scenario tree, a forward scenario tree construction technique is employed. An extensive numerical study is carried out to investigate the applicability of the presented model and rolling horizon procedure, the efficiency of risk-measurement policies, and the performance of the scenario tree construction technique. Several key practical and managerial insights related to the dynamic supply chain network design under uncertainty are gained based on the computational results. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={This paper provides a review of the literature while contributing to academic understanding of the concepts of agility and flexibility within the supply chain. The research identified 83 peer-reviewed articles through a structured review technique, which is based on a three-stage refinement process. Data reduction procedures using codification, sentence strings and a review of keywords, title, abstract and conclusion were used in the search. The papers identified focused on organizational and supply chain agility and flexibility. The acknowledged gaps in understanding and development of agility and flexibility in supply chains were identified and categorized in terms of conceptual, contextual and methodological gaps. Subsequent to the gap analysis, this paper argues that effective relationship integration with key partners is a fundamental mechanism for mitigating the problem of control dissipation, which has hindered academic understanding with respect to development and application of agile and flexible capabilities in supply chains. The findings in this paper will help academics to gain a better understanding and to develop the concepts of supply chain agility and flexibility. In addition, the findings indicate that supply chain stakeholders need to address the issue of relationship integration when undertaking, or participating in agility and flexibility development programmes, so as to maximize supply chain performance. The paper concludes by highlighting implications for managers and researchers, and proposes a number of areas for future investigation. © 2016 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Specifically, the issue of where and in what ways flexibility has been incorporated across the organisation's supply chain is addressed. Design/methodology/approach: A two-phase methodology design based on literature review and case study was used. Using 83 journal articles in the areas of uncertainty and flexibility an analytical process for assessing uncertainty-flexibility mismatches was developed. Furthermore, results from ten interviews with senior/middle managers within the Australian manufacturing sector were used to provide preliminary insights on the usefulness and importance of the analytical process and its relationship with organisational practice. Findings: The paper emphasises the importance of having a systematic and encompassing view of uncertainty-flexibility mismatches across the supply chain, as well as the significance of socio-technical engagement. The paper both conceptually and empirically illustrates how, using a structured analytical process, flexibility requirements across the supply, process, control and demand segments of a supply chain might be assessed. A four-step analytical process was accordingly developed and, its application, usefulness and importance discussed using empirical data. Practical implications: The analytical process presented in this paper can assist managers to obtain a comprehensive overview of supply chain flexibility when dealing with situations involving uncertainty. This can facilitate and improve their decision-making with respect to prioritising attention on identified flexibility gaps in order to ensure stability of their performance. Originality/value: The paper presents a supply chain-wide discussion on the difficulties that uncertainty brings to organisations, and how organisational flexibility might serve to moderate those challenges for supply chain management. It discusses how to identify the flexibility gap and proposes an original analytical process for systematic assessment of uncertainty-flexibility mismatches. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper aims at designing a sustainable and resilient tire closed-loop supply chain network based on a real case study in Iran. To immune the network against disruptions, a new resiliency approach is proposed by extending efficient demand coverage plans. The developed model includes four objectives. The first objective minimizes the total costs of the network along with maximizing the coverage of customers’ demand. As a new concept, the second objective maximizes the operational reliability of facilities to extend a consistent and responsive tire supply chain. Also, to design a sustainable network, the third objective function minimizes CO2 emissions in the strategic and tactical planning horizons. Moreover, the fourth objective maximizes the social responsibility of the network via introducing new social factors. A new mixed fuzzy possibilistic flexible programming method is also proposed to handle constraints’ violations and parameters’ uncertainty. Outputs confirm the accurate performance of the extended model and ensure its applicability in the real-world case study. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach: A survey research design is adopted to collect primary data from 177 automotive components suppliers. After assessing the measures' psychometric properties, the hypothesized relationships are evaluated using hierarchical regression analysis supplemented by structural equation modeling and complementarity test. Findings: In the context of industrial markets, and specifically the automotive component industry, a complementary interaction effect is found between coordination and cooperation. The complementary impact was significant in affecting the supply chain adaptability and the firm's performance. Our results refine the existing supply chain integration by highlighting the complementary effect of coordination and cooperation. Practical implications: Understanding the true interaction effect between cooperation and coordination to develop supply chain integration avoids decision-makers' misperception over or underinvesting in activities. This research also provides key insights on the complementary effect of coordination and cooperation to establish structural flexibility in the supply chain and the ability to respond to the disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

abstract={Purpose: Drawing on complementarity theory, this paper aims to examine the type and effect of interdependencies/interaction (i.e. complementarity or substitutability) between the supply chain capabilities of agility, adaptability and alignment. Design/methodology/approach: A survey research design is adopted to collect primary and secondary data from 182 international firms. The complementarity (or substitutability) of three As (agile, adaptable and aligned) were analyzed in three-way and pairwise interactions; both, correlation and performance differences methods of testing the type of interactions among the system’s elements were used. Supply chain-centric and firm-centric performance metrics were used to examine the interaction types. Findings: The study did not find empirical evidence of three-way complementarity between the three As. However, this paper did find evidence of complementarity in bivariate interactions for alignment and adaptability. Moreover, in the performance difference method, the study found a substitute relationship between all pairs of As. Practical implications: The findings related to the substitutability between the three As offer managers guidance on how to allocate their limited resources to avoid unnecessary over-or under-investing in either one of the three As. Originality/value: This study helps refine prior findings related to the three As by offering evidence that firms can still achieve their performance-related goals with reduced investment commitments by taking advantage of the substitutability relationship existent between these capabilities. That is, instead of concomitantly developing all three As as past studies have suggested, managers can use the findings to determine how to prioritize their resource allocation better. Furthermore, understanding the actual interaction among the supply chain variables generally provide insights for designing the supply chain, change management in the supply chain, developing supply chain strategy and adopting best practices in the supply chain. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The uncertainty in the supply chains (SCs) for manufacturing and services firms is going to be, over the coming decades, more important for the companies that are called to compete in a new globalized economy. Risky situations for manufacturing are considered in trying to individuate the optimal positioning of the order penetration point (OPP). It aims at defining the best level of information of the client’s order going back through the several supply chain (SC) phases, i.e. engineering, procurement, production and distribution. This work aims at defining a system dynamics model to assess competitiveness coming from the positioning of the order in different SC locations. A Taguchi analysis has been implemented to create a decision map for identifying possible strategic decisions under different scenarios and with alternatives for order location in the SC levels. Centralized and decentralized strategies for SC integration are discussed. In the model proposed, the location of OPP is influenced by the demand variation, production time, stock-outs and stock amount. Results of this research are as follows: (i) customer-oriented strategies are preferable under high volatility of demand, (ii) production-focused strategies are suggested when the probability of stock-outs is high, (iii) no specific location is preferable if a centralized control architecture is implemented, (iv) centralization requires cooperation among partners to achieve the SC optimum point, (v) the producer must not prefer the OPP location at the Retailer level when the general strategy is focused on a decentralized approach. © 2017 Growing Science Ltd.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to evaluate the roles of a transactive memory system and the supply network flexibility (SNF) of the firm as antecedents of a firm’s supply chain agility (FSCA), also incorporating the moderating role of the transactive memory system; and, second, to evaluate the relationship between FSCA and operations performance (OP). Design/methodology/approach: Four hypothesized relationships are tested with survey data from 190 high-tech firms using structural equation models. Findings: FSCA can be enhanced through the transactive memory system and SNF, although a higher degree of transactive memory system weakens the positive relationship between SNF and FSCA. A positive relationship is identified between FSCA and OP, while FSCA mediates the relationship between SNF and OP. Practical implications: Managers can increase FSCA and improve OP by developing both the transactive memory system and SNF. Given that firms have limited resources, investment in internal capabilities should be prioritized as this appears to be more effective at developing FSCA. Originality/value: The findings expand the literature by exploring two antecedents of FSCA and by analyzing the impact of FSCA on different measures of OP. Few prior studies have highlighted the importance of the transactive memory system to the operations function. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper investigates the effects of legal-political factors and market competition on supply chain performance. The data were collected from firms in the electrical and electronics (E&E) sector in an Indonesian free trade zone (FTZ) on the island of Batam. The E&E firms were chosen because of their significant contribution to Indonesian exports. The sampling of this study was E&E firms involved in exporting activities. As part of survey research, hypothesis-testing was undertaken to explain the variance in the legal-political factors and market competition to predict the two measurements of supply chain performance of the E&E firms in Batam. Since structural equation modelling (SEM-PLS) path modelling 2.0 works efficiently with small sample sizes and complex models, this analytical tool was employed in the study. The findings reveal that legal-political factors and market competition were positively significant on supply chain performance-efficiency and supply chain performance-flexibility. This study suggests that firm success is not necessarily tied to the size of its investment. Rather, it is the interrelationship amongst the factors that influences the supply chain.

abstract={The challenge of food waste in the global foodservice sector is significant, and novel approaches are required for its minimization. These approaches can be grounded on the principles of industrial symbiosis which promote inter-sectoral collaboration for better resource efficiency. Foodservices can partner with farmers for food waste collection and its subsequent use as fertilizer or animal feedstock. Anecdotal evidence of industrial symbiosis adopted by foodservices and farmers exists, but no empirical research has been undertaken to understand the determinants of broader industry adoption of industrial symbiosis and how these determinants could be reinforced. This study explores the potential of industrial symbiosis to minimize food waste in commercial foodservices in Russia. By interviewing foodservice providers and farmers, the study demonstrates willingness of selected stakeholders to uptake industrial symbiosis as a means of food waste recovery, but also as an opportunity to reinforce social and network capital of foodservice operators and farmers. To encourage broader industry uptake, policy-makers should build inter-sectoral capacity by connecting foodservices and farmers. Not only will this minimize food waste but can also build more resilient and responsive food supply chains. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

abstract={Building on the variety of different methods to operationalize flexibility in supply chains, this paper presents a process-oriented approach for the measurement and planning of inbound logistics flexibility in global production networks. Using the automotive industry as an example, process sequences of the overseas supply like transportation, storing or handling are parameterized regarding their respective flexibility range as well as the time- and cost-related implications of their adjustment. On this basis, a model to evaluate benefits and costs associated with the investment in logistics flexibility can be derived in order to support the decision-making process for a rolling planning on a tactical level. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Today's supply chains (SC) are acting in an ever more complex, dynamic and uncertain business environment. Increased customer expectations regarding product variety, shortened product life-cycles and volatile demand motivate the need for supply chain flexibility (SCF) in the face of stiff competition and environmental changes. Flexibility processes implementation in supply chains varies according to companies and SC, due to several factors. The level of awareness of the need for flexibility, the proactive or reactive plan and use of flexibility; and the focus on the SC as a whole or in single companies are examples. The concept of process maturity assumes that the implementation of procedures is carried out in multiple evolutionary and successive stages, which are explicitly defined, managed and measured. Maturity models give companies indicators as well as guidance to analyze and subsequently improve their processes. Despite several SC maturity models in the literature, there is not a model focusing on the maturity of SC flexibility processes, like the one intended in this paper. The levels of the maturity of SCF are (1) none, (2) inter-firm, (3) SC reactive, (4) SC proactive, and (5) SC paradigmatic. Each level has five dimensions: (1) Collaboration, (2) Information Technology, (3) Information flow, (4) Internal flexibility types and (5) Performance measurement. A toy case drawn from the automotive industry illustrates the application of the model from a dyad perspective. Based on the findings, SC flexibility maturity levels are measured in each of the analyzed links and areas for improvement are identified. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Today's supply chains are challenged by volatile customer demand. Demand for a wider product choice, shortened product lifecycle and expected high availability add to the already complex, dynamic and uncertain business environment. Operating under such conditions poses difficulties to a company to uphold their supply chain's performance. Flexibility is required to be able to adapt to unanticipated changes in supply or demand and to diminish their repercussions. Miscellaneous flexibility measures, e.g. safety stocks or flexible capacities, are widespread used to compensate demand fluctuations. The selected measures' parameters, e.g. range of flexible capacity, must be configured ahead of the implementation in practice. The flexibility parameters determine the scope of action a flexibility measure enables. This paper seeks to address conceptually the issue of setting robust flexibility parameters using a simulation-based optimization approach. Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization are used in a distributed island approach to optimize the flexibility parameters. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Due to their social influence, several areas research search and rescue field. Mobile robotics is one of them that analyzes and seeks more efficient solutions for search and rescue operations. Multirobot systems are considered to make the procedures more efficient and safe, both for the victim and for the crew. Petri nets are widely diffused for designing discrete events systems, such as networks and protocols, software modeling, workflow and business processes, supply chains and flexible manufacturing systems. Petri nets inside RFID distributed database, or PNRD, is a formal data structure, which relates Petri net with radio frequency identification components. It was initially designed for logistical and manufacturing processes, facilitating automatic monitoring and traceability of spurious events to objects identified by a tag and passing through pre-defined locations where the antennas and readers are installed. On the scope of search and rescue operations on trails and crossings, it is proposed to use a modified PNRD to assist in the traceability of users and, with that, direct the robots' local search in case of people disappearance. The environment is then analyzed, and it is comprised of heterogeneous robotic agents from the viewpoint of modeling agent behavior, embedding models in microcontrollers and monitoring the system's evolution.

abstract={Over the past 20years organizations have put significant energy into making smarter decisions in their enterprise wide central planning and "available to promise" processes to improve responsiveness (more effective use of assets and more intelligent responses to customer needs and emerging opportunities). However, firms have put only limited energies into factory floor decisions and capacity planning and almost none into generating a tighter coupling between the factory and central planning. The bulk of the work to make "smarter factory decisions" has focused on two simple metrics: increasing output and reducing cycle time-often without accommodating the need to run lots at different velocities and without recognizing how the operating curve (trade-off between lead time and tool utilization-Appendix 3) links them. In fact, many of the recent Lean initiatives have focused on eliminating variability to induce simplicity to achieve improved output or cycle time without concern for the impact on responsiveness or capacity. The purpose of this paper is to (a) make clear the critical, and often overlooked, role of factory responsiveness with respect to central planning; (b) explain how traditional factory planning and the current application of Lean can severely impact the firm's responsiveness; (c) elaborate on touch points between central and factory planning demonstrating simple tactical methods that can improve responsiveness and protect the factory from churn; (d) explain why smarter dispatch scheduling is critical to successful responsiveness; and (e) outline the basics of smarter dispatch scheduling. Although the focus of this paper is the factory, many of the core concepts apply to a wide range of industries from restaurants to health care delivery. © Springer-Verlag London 2012.},

abstract={Purpose: This research investigates the impact of the strategic sourcing process on the supply chain response to COVID-19. The paper presents practitioners' perspectives (experts in supply chain management, especially involved in the procurement field) on the strategic sourcing process's impact on the supply chain response. Design/methodology/approach: The study follows a survey-based approach for data collection. It uses a descriptive survey methodology where questions related to the impact of the strategic sourcing process on the supply chain response in the face of the coronavirus pandemic were explored by practitioners. Findings: In total, 130 valid responses were obtained. The results showed that the majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that strategic sourcing positively impacts the supply chain response amid the COVID-19 effects. Also, for the five phases of the strategic sourcing process, the majority of respondents considered them as a high and very high impact on the supply chain response. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides timely insights for practitioners and academics, especially those involved in the supply chain management area, showing how the strategic sourcing process plays an important role in making supply chains more responsive amid disruption situations. Practical implications: Findings of this paper clearly shows the impact of the phases of the strategic sourcing process on the responsiveness of the supply chains amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This can encourage supply chain leadership to devote more time to strategic sourcing initiatives to generate improvements on the supply chain performance. Originality/value: This paper is unique since it brings an unexplored relation in respect to strategic sourcing amid disruption situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, from a practitioner's perspective. It also significantly contributes to developing new directions for the supply chain management domain to deal with large-scale disruptions, such as the coronavirus pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to explore how the manufacturing and supply chain flexibility impact on the ability to transfer production between the units, i.e. production network coordination. To take advantage of available opportunities for different actors and locations, companies need to effectively transfer production. Design/methodology/approach-The case studied was a transfer of production between The Netherlands and Sweden. The case was selected based on the opportunity it provided to perform a longitudinal study of an ongoing production transfer. Findings-Different flexibility dimensions have different importance depending on the receiver or sender. A production transfer can be divided into four parts: knowledge, physical, administrative and supply chain transfer. The manufacturing flexibility have a high impact on the physical and knowledge transfer, the new product development dimension also have a major impact on the administrative transfer in combination with the supply chain flexibility dimension IT. The supply chain transfer was impacted by the supply chain flexibility dimensions except IT. Practical implications-The paper presents a first step towards a tool for analysing the strength and weaknesses within units in relation to receiving/sending production. Furthermore, that the production transfer should be viewed as four parts with interdependencies help to identify the order of the transfer process. Originality/value-This paper widens the flexibility concept to a network level. Furthermore, it describes the link between the strategic decision of coordination in the network and the operational ability of the network to accomplish this change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

A more transparent supply chain would help to react in real-time by detecting and solving many issues e.g. production interruptions and delivery bottlenecks. A supply chain digital twin can help to increase the transparency and create an overall more robust and flexible supply chain. With real-time data streams from sensors, a digital twin allows simulation, monitoring, and controlling and provides information about its real-world counterpart. Based on a literature review approach, we analyze academic and industrial application and use cases to identify the current state-of-the-art of supply chain digital twins. Subsequently we develop a classification scheme for supply chain digital twins. The classification scheme provides six different dimensions like scope, actor, asset, flow reference object, performance measurement, and supply chain process that are relevant for digital twins in the context of supply chain. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), interconnected smart devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) and other data sources are increasingly bridging the gap between the physical and digital world by providing fine-grained data about real-world events. Enterprise software systems are adopting the paradigm of event-based systems (EBS) to enable them to react to meaningful events in a timely manner. Smart supply chains fusing dynamic sensor data with information provided by backend-systems are one such example of event-based enterprise systems. Monitoring their global state in an effective way for runtime governance remains an open research challenge: providing the required type of information while trading off precision for costs. We previously introduced application-specific integrated aggregation (ASIA) as a means for collecting metadata in distributed event-based systems. In this paper, we show how ASIA can support IT Service Management in monitoring and governing decentralized event-based enterprise systems at runtime. We present a dashboard based on industry-strength technology as proof of concept and discuss how to integrate usage statistics provided on-the-fly by ASIA into metrics for runtime governance.

In this paper, a centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy is applied to control inventories in a 4 echelons supply chain. The single MPC controller used in this strategy optimizes globally and finds an optimal ordering policy for each node. The controller relies on a linear discrete-time state-space model to predict process output and the prediction can be approached by two multi-step predictors, which depend on measurability of the controller states. The objective function takes a quadratic form and thus the resulting optimization problem can be solved via standard quadratic programming. Simulation results show that centralized MPC strategy can track customer demand and maintain a proper inventory position level with reduced Bullwhip effect. © IFAC.},

abstract={Manufacturing firms those who produce a variety of products with complex product designs are being challenged when sourcing and distribution of goods are globalized. Apparel fabrication is a one such Industry in Sri Lanka which produce a greater variety of apparel with complex product designs. The Industry operates in globally connected dynamic supply chain that adhere to green initiatives and environment compliances and hence operational performance has been confronted. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the role of integrated green supply chain practices on operational performance when the varieties of products been produced. A survey was conducted with 161 front end factory merchandising units of apparel manufacturers' in Sri Lanka. Structured Equation Modeling with AMOS is used to test the hypothetical relationships. The study found that, operational performance is lower in firms when they produce a variety of products. But, the operational performance intensified positively with the production of variety of products within a green supply chain integrated. Variety of product designs did not result positive operational performance unless the supply chain is not integrated. This study emphasized the complementary application of resource based view with coordination theory to explain how resources of the firm should allocate and coordinate among production portfolio. The resource allocation and coordination among the actors in the networked set-up associates with production portfolio dynamics and hence result positive outcomes. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).},

abstract={Quality management (QM) for dynamic supply chains (DSCs) in a flexible-based environment has received increasing attention in current business environment. This study focuses on the development of an QM tool, based on the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) approach, and demonstrates how it can be extended from application in supply chain management (SCM) to other business environments. The main contributions are to implement an iterative process using FMEA for DSCs in a flexible-based environment by overcoming the weaknesses associated with traditional FMEA system and to develop a user-friendly interface, with which the distributed parties in chains could cooperate as a whole and meet the needs of dynamic control. In specific, this paper proposes a computerintegrated FMEA approach that enhanced FMEA in SCM through automated processing using a fuzzy approach and a computer-integrated and internet-based interface to support the system implementation. The efficiency and practical implication of the proposed system has been validated by the developed system with a case study. The developed system can help prevent possible failures in the design and operations and, furthermore, the assurance of quality for DSCs in a flexible-based environment. The proposed system may easily be extended to more complex real-world applications. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2011.},

abstract={Backfill is the excavated material from earthworks, which constitutes over 50% of the construction wastes in Hong Kong. This paper considers a supply chain that consists of construction sites, landfills and commercial sources in which operators seek cooperation to maximize backfill reuse and improve waste recovery efficiency. Unlike the ordinary material supply chain in manufacturing industries, the supply chain for backfill involves many dynamic processes, which increases the complexity of analyzing and solving the logistic issue. Therefore, this study attempts to identify an appropriate methodology to analyze the dynamic supply chain, for facilitating the backfill reuse. A centralized optimization model and a distributed agent-based model are proposed and implemented in comparing their performances. The centralized optimization model can obtain a global optimum but requires sharing of complete information from all supply chain entities, resulting in barriers for implementation. In addition, whenever the backfill supply chain changes, the centralized optimization model needs to reconfigure the network structure and recompute the optimum. The distributed agent-based model focuses on task distribution and cooperation between business entities in the backfill supply chain. In the agent-based model, decision making and communication between construction sites, landfills, and commercial sources are emulated by a number of autonomous agents. They perform together through a negotiation algorithm for optimizing the supply chain configuration that reduces the backfill shipment cost. A comparative study indicates that the agent-based model is more capable of studying the dynamic backfill supply chain due to its decentralization of optimization and fast reaction to unexpected disturbances. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Uncertainties in global market such as trade wars and extreme weather conditions disrupt the flow of goods in the global supply chains. This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach for an autonomous inventory replenishment planning model that attempts to capture few aspects of the goods such as market demand, costs associated with the inventory, product life cycle, and/or seasonality along with a set of inventory policies. The proposed model has been evaluated using two different time horizons viz., weekly and monthly, and it is observed from our simulation runs that monthly planning provides around 30% cost reductions compared with weekly planning, and the algorithm is found to select the right policy in about 85–95% of the times across the experiments. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, an Internal Model Control (IMC) scheme is incorporated in production inventory control systems in a complete supply chain. This control scheme presents a good target inventory tracking under the perfect knowledge of the system. Furthermore, the inventory tracking and load disturbance rejection control problems can be tackled separately. However, the closed-loop performance of the IMC scheme may be degraded due to a mismatch between the modelled and actual delay or to the fact that delays may be time-varying. Thus, the IMC control scheme is enhanced in this work with a novel method for the online identification of lead times based on a multimodel scheme. In this way, all benefits of the IMC scheme can be exploited. A detailed discussion of the proposed production inventory system is provided including a stability and performance analysis as well as the identification capabilities of the algorithm. Several simulation examples illustrate the efficiency of the approach. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Likewise, we used statistical software WarpPLS 5.0®, which is based on partial least squares algorithms, to assess the six hypotheses established in the model. Such hypotheses were validated with a 95 % confidence level, and values were standardized to avoid problems regarding the measurement scale. Findings demonstrate that ICT have a positive direct impact on the other three analysed latent variables, which together account for 63 % of the variability of SC economic performance. Similarly, we found that ICT can explain up to 40 % of the variability of SC agility. © 2017 PEI, University of Maribor. All rights reserved.},

In this research paper, we propose a structural equation model that measures the impact of four human factors (knowledge, abilities, skills, and availability) on production process flexibility and supply chain agility in the wine industry of La Rioja, Spain. The results obtained indicate that these human factors have a direct and positive impact on production process flexibility and supply chain agility. Likewise, they can be indirectly linked to supply chain agility through production process flexibility. Based on these findings, this research encourages La Rioja wineries to jointly work with viticulture and enology programs of Spanish universities. This collaboration would enhance the impact of human factors on the wine industry, which would in turn allow wineries to rapidly and more effectively respond to customer needs.

Two competitive environment variables are analysed: competitive intensity of the industry and complexity of the SC. Two opposing competitive strategies are also considered: cost and differentiation. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses have been tested using data gathered via a questionnaire given to 277 Spanish manufacturing companies, and structural equation modelling has been used for the analysis. Findings: The results show that competitive intensity is the most influential factor followed by business strategy. SC complexity does not seem to affect agility. Moreover, although the competitive environment variables affect the business strategy, the latter has no mediating effects between the competitive environment and SC agility, adaptability and alignment capabilities. Originality/value: This study presents new insights into the environmental and strategic drivers linked to the implementation of SC agility, adaptability and alignment capabilities and offers guidelines to managers involved in SC management. © 2021, Pedro Garrido-Vega, Macarena Sacristán-Díaz, José Moyano-Fuentes and Rafaela Alfalla-Luque.},

abstract={Just like the world financial system, but for different reasons, 21st-century corporations need a new business model for their enterprise supply chains. The old conventions no longer work in this new world of volatile and increasingly unpredictable demand and supply. The enterprise needs to become more 'connected' to its own parts, as well as its partners up and down the chains it participates in. So too, we need to embrace new ways of looking at customers to gain deeper, more insightful impressions of what they are telling us about the way they want to buy our products and services. Finally, these signals need converting into corresponding action, driven by the people in the business, leaders and staff alike, who are aligned to their customers' wishes. This is the world of dynamic supply chain alignment where, increasingly, supply chains are the business. In the follow-up to his hugely successful Strategic Supply Chain Alignment, John Gattorna's Dynamic Supply Chain Alignment, explores how to create and sustain multiple supply chains with a level of flexibility and responsiveness that allow you to respond to opportunities and threats; at the same time aligning with your suppliers, your partners and your customers. When more executives get to this stage of development the profits will flow more readily, and sustainability of performance will not be the same issue it is today. The way forward is right there in front of us; but, says John Gattorna, we must throw off old ways and embrace the new. © John Gattorna 2009. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: Firms can choose from an array of approaches for reducing the detrimental financial effects caused by unfavorable fluctuations in commodity prices. The purpose of this paper is to provide guidance for effectively estimating the financial effects of mitigating commodity price risk volatility (CPV) in supply chain management decisions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts two prominent and complementary methodologies, namely, total cost of ownership (TCO and real options valuation (ROV), to illustrate how commodity price risk mitigation strategies can be analyzed with respect to their effect on costs and performance. The paper provides insights through a case study to demonstrate the application of these methods together and establish the benefits and challenges associated with their implementation. Findings: The paper illustrates advantages and disadvantages of TCO and ROV and how these approaches can be adopted together to contribute to effective purchasing decisions. Supply chain flexibility is a key capability but requires investments. Holistically measuring the financial effects of flexibility investments is imperative for gaining executive management support in mitigating commodity price volatility. Research limitations/implications: This study can provide supply chain professionals with useful guidance for measuring the costs and benefits related to developing strategies for mitigating commodity price volatility. TCO provides a focus on the costs associated with the commodity purchasing process, and ROV enables the aggregation of all the costs and benefits associated with the use of the strategy and synthesizes them into the net value estimate. Originality/value: The paper provides a comparison of different but complementary approaches, specifically TCO and ROV, for analyzing the effectiveness of CPV risk mitigation decisions. In addition, these two methods allow supply chain professionals to evaluate and control the financial effects of CPV risk, particularly the impact of mitigation on firm’s cash flows. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this study, we use a differential game model to examine the strategic quality control behaviour of participants in a food supply chain comprising two food raw material suppliers and one food manufacturer. We study two cases, one of the centralised system and one of the decentralised system, and fully characterise the equilibrium quality control decisions of all participants in both cases. The findings show that under the centralised setting, the quality control of the raw material suppliers and the manufacturer reaches the optimal level. More importantly, the system can reach coordination through participants sharing their quality cost. © 2021 Northeastern University, China.},

abstract={COVID-19 has revealed global supply chains’ vulnerability and sparked debate about increasing supply chain resilience (SCRES). Previous SCRES research has primarily focused on near-term responses to large-scale disruptions, neglecting long-term resilience approaches. We address this research gap by presenting empirical evidence from a Delphi study. Based on the resource dependence theory, we developed 10 projections for 2025 on promising supply chain adaptations, which were assessed by 94 international supply chain experts from academia and industry. The results reveal that companies prioritize bridging over buffering approaches as long-term responses for increasing SCRES. Promising measures include increasing risk criteria importance in supplier selection, supply chain collaboration, and supply chain mapping.

Moreover, we present a stakeholder analysis confirming one of the resource dependence theory's central propositions for the future of global supply chains: companies differently affected by externalities will choose different countermeasures. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The markets in which manufacturers and service firms compete are increasingly influenced by intense foreign competition, rapid technological change, and shorter product life cycles. In this new scenario, flexibility may be one of the most important capabilities needed for firms to achieve competitive advantage. The possible behaviors of the company to the problems it faces are called levers of flexibilities. In a supply chain, the flexibility of one entity is highly dependent on the flexibility of upstream entities. It is a natural area for metrics. A metric is a standard of measurement of performance and gives the basis on which to evaluate the performance of processes in the supply chain. Thus, the purpose of the study is to determine and evaluate the supply chain flexibility levers in order to calculate the benefit of preferring a flexibility lever to another one. The analytic network process (ANP) technique is used for prioritizing evaluated flexibility levers.

abstract={Nowadays, managing uncertainties and urgencies are one of the most important things for the companies. Flexibility term is the capacity of adaptation in these uncertainties and urgencies, that's why flexibility is one of the most important capabilities needed for firms to achieve competitive advantage. The possible behaviors of the company to increase flexibility are called levers of flexibilities. We are handling the automotive sector for the study. Some of the reasons to choose automotive industry are the economic significance of automotive industry for many countries, the huge volume of manufacturing activities in the world and the high level of knowledge in the industry. In this paper, we propose a flexibility model for automotive industry supply chain. The aim is to rank flexibility levers from the most important to the less important one according to automotive industry supply chain needs and to decide to invest on the more profitable levers. For this purpose, a combination of two MCDM techniques, namely Analytic Network Process and ELECTRE methods, is used.},

abstract={Scholars believe that the newly introduced Industry 5.0 has the potential to move beyond the profit-centered productivity of Industry 4.0 and to promote sustainable development goals such as human-centricity, socio-environmental sustainability, and resilience. However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0. © 2022},

abstract={Purpose: Despite the ongoing calls for the incorporation of the cloud utility model, the effect of the cloud on elements of supply chain performance is still an evolving area of research. The purpose of this paper is to develop the architecture of a cloud-based supply chain management (C-SCM) ecosystem and explore how it enhances supply chain responsiveness (SCR). Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors discuss the potential benefits that cloud computing can yield, compared to existing mature SCM information systems and solutions through a comprehensive literature review. The authors conceptualise SCR in terms of the level of visibility in the supply chain, supply chain flexibility and rapid detection and reaction to changes, and then the authors build the detailed architecture of a C-SCM system. The proposed ecosystem introduces a view of SCM and the associated practices when transferred to cloud environments. The potential to enhance SCR through the cloud is explored with scenarios on a case of supply chain operations in fashion retail industry. Findings: The findings show that the proposed system can enhance all three dimensions of SCR. Implications for supply chain practice and how companies can migrate to a cloud supply chain are drawn. Originality/value: Given that the development, creation and delivery of goods and services are increasingly becoming a joint effort of several parties in a supply chain, the authors contribute to the existing literature by introducing a comprehensive C-SCM system and show how companies can enhance their SCR. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It is motivated by the increasing attention that the design of adaptive supply chains has been receiving in recent years, as it is considered one of the most important critical factors in gaining sustainable competitive advantage in the current hypercompetitive environment. Focusing on two learning processes (i.e., by imitation and by interacting), diverse types of adaptive supply chains recognizable within industrial districts are compared by means of an agent-based simulation on the basis of their adaptive performance in environments characterized by different level of complexity and turbulence. The results confirm that the supply chain type influences the relationship between learning and adaptation and that both the product complexity and the turbulence of the environment moderate this effect. Finally, the best adaptive supply chain in each type of context is identified. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study aims to evaluate the behaviour of Listeria monocytogenes under fluctuating temperature comparing the efficacy of deterministic and stochastic methods for its prediction. In the first part of the study, a strain of L. monocytogenes was maintained at two different fluctuating temperature regimes both from 2 to 8 C and regularly sampled for the quantitative determination. The first temperature regime lasted 204 hours with a fluctuation length of 12 hours whereas the second lasted 167 hours with a fluctuation length of 24 hours. A dynamic predictive model was implemented for the reproduction of the observed data. Model resolution has been carried out by using values of the recorded temperature as well as the value of the mean temperature, the kinetic mean temperature, the 75th and 95th percentile of the temperature. A stochastic resolution was also performed considering the mean temperature and Standard Deviation as stochastic variable. In the second part of the study, a temperature mean curve was constructed by monitoring temperature of 8 refrigerated conveyances, 10 display cabinet and 15 domestic refrigerators. This curve was used to obtain predictive scenarios for L. monocytogenes based on the above and also considering temperature regime suggested by the EURL Lm TECHNICAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENT on challenge tests and durability studies for assessing shelf-life of ready-to-eat foods related to Listeria monocytogenes (Version 4 of 1 July 2021). All predicted behaviours were compared to the observed ones through the Root Mean Squared Error. Firstly, dynamic predictive model as well as the stochastic one, provided the best level of reproducibility of the observed data. The kinetic mean temperature reproduced the observed data better than the mean temperature for the 12 hoursregime while for the 24 hours-regime was the opposite. The 75th and 95th percentile overestimated the observed growths. Secondary, predictions obtained with the mean temperature, kinetic temperature and stochastic approach well fitted the observed data. The 75th and 95th percentile of Temperature and the “Eurl LM” temperature regimes overestimated the observed prediction. Dynamic approach as well as the stochastic one allowed to obtain the lowest values of Root Mean Squared Error. The mean temperature and kinetic mean temperature appeared the most representative values in a deterministic “single-point” approach. © 2022 The Authors.},

However, despite their inherent advantages (e.g., increasing the flexibility of supply chains), feedforward controls remain underdeveloped in the pharmaceutical distribution sector, largely due to the tediousness of identifying applicable anticipatory indicators. To properly anticipate the achievement of business objectives, in our in-depth case study of a Swiss wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical products we relied on the notion of weak signals as conceptualized by Ansoff to develop a conceptual framework of feedforward. We identified a weak signal that showed more occurrences of error when less versatile employees were involved in executing tasks. The standard operating procedure for customer complaint management was recently adapted to include a feedforward control based on the weak signal. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: Scholars have recently begun to empirically evaluate the triple-A supply chain, which emphasizes concurrent capabilities in agility, adaptability and alignment across the supply chain to develop sustainable competitive advantage. Complexity theory suggests however that other combinations of triple-A capabilities may be equally effective, especially given a firm's strategic orientation relative to its market and its supply chain. Our research objective was to examine what combinations of these capabilities lead to the same outcome (i.e. high firm performance). Design/methodology/approach: We collected 182 survey responses from a global sample of supply chain managers. Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) was employed to assess effective recipes of agility, adaptability, alignment, supply chain orientation, and market orientation. Findings: Our results revealed four distinct “recipes” (i.e. combinations of agility, adaptability, alignment, supply chain orientation and market orientation) that lead to high levels of firm performance. Originality/value: Our results indicate that firms currently do not necessarily have to concomitantly develop capabilities across all triple-A components. Considering the costs associated with developing each of these capabilities, the findings allow us to derive several theoretical and managerial insights. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To address this, this study explores how supply chain orientation and operational flexibility (FLX) facilitate the implementation of MO. Although the positive impact of MO on firm performance has been well established, this study highlights that such benefits are enhanced by the development of supply chain related capabilities. Results indicate that market-oriented firms are more likely to realize the strategic importance of managing the supply chain when operating under conditions of high environmental munificence, dynamism, and complexity. This provides a better understanding of the complex relationship between the demand and supply sides of the firm. This study highlights the importance of marketing theory and concepts to supply chain management scholars, and vice versa. This further accentuates the importance of eliminating the disconnect between supply and demand-management processes, also described as the "Great Divide" (Drucker 1973; Esper et al. 2010a,b). A number of key managerial implications are offered as well. © Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of logistics capabilities in achieving supply chain agility through a multi-disciplinary review of the relevant research. The systematic literature review aims to provide the basis for formulating a conceptual framework of the relationship. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic, comprehensive review of the literature on manufacturing, organizational and supply chain agility from 1991 through 2010 was conducted. The literature on logistics capabilities was also examined to identify the various elements that contribute to supply chain agility. Findings: Supply chain agility has primarily been explored in the literature through a focus on manufacturing flexibility, supply chain speed, or lean manufacturing. The role of logistics capabilities in achieving supply chain agility has not been addressed from a holistic conceptual perspective. This research addresses that gap using a multi-disciplinary approach. As such, it is the first phase in theory building on the concept of supply chain agility. Further research is needed to empirically test the conceptualized relationships. Research limitations/implications: This research is a systematic, integrative review of the existing literature on the concept of agility and logistics capabilities. As such, the next phase of research needed for theory building will be the operationalization of constructs and testing of the hypothesized relationships proposed by the conceptual framework. Practical implications: The level of agility in a supply chain can determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the collective efforts. It is important that firms become more knowledgeable about the role of logistics capabilities in achieving agility. Originality/value: Through a systematic, comprehensive review of the literature in four distinct areas, the paper explores the relationship between logistics capabilities and supply chain agility. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Articles from supply chain management, disaster management, and economics were reviewed, keywords were identified within a disaster management lifecycle framework, and a lexical analysis of the articles was conducted. The analysis reveals that previous research has primarily focused on humanitarian operations, with researchers adapting established supply chain methodologies to improve humanitarian disaster response. While this has benefited humanitarian organizations in their ability to respond to disasters with greater efficiency, it also clarifies that there has been little research done on humanitarian development, the overlooked part of humanitarian operations. This finding suggests the need for future research to focus on the role that humanitarian development plays in reducing future social and economic disaster losses. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Vector control, particularly distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), constitutes one of the major pathways to prevent and reduce malaria transmission. ITN distribution campaigns face several challenges, such as inadequate funding, budgetary constraints, hard-to-reach areas, limited transportation, and market and price volatility. While long-term agreements and proper planning can effectively overcome such challenges, those options may not be available for all humanitarian organizations and governments. To gain a better understanding of such tradeoffs we develop a robust optimization model that minimize ITN distribution costs while taking into consideration protection against financial, market and logistical uncertainties. The simultaneous account of such uncertainties is rarely seen on the humanitarian supply chain design literature. The proposed robust model explores data-driven adaptive uncertainty sets that capture the dependence structure among procurement and distribution costs, leading to plausible uncertain scenarios. In addition, we develop a hierarchical optimization approach to ease the burden of setting a specific robustness level for each constraint, when uncertainties are related to the independent terms. We study a United Nations Children’s Fund ITN distribution campaign in Ivory Coast, observing that (1) total costs increase with campaign robustness, as expected, and (2) campaign robustness comprises of improved supply chain flexibility, which might minimize efforts if it becomes necessary to adjust procurement and transportation plans when uncertainty arises. In addition, assessing robust solutions through Monte Carlo simulations against several realizations of uncertain parameter values indicates that, as desired, robust plan feasibility increases with the specified level of conservatism. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Panama is considered as a service country, in which the Panama Canal contributes with more than $1.5 million per year to the state. Known as a logistic hub, Panama's economy depends on service industries. This happens in most of the countries around the world, the service sector represents more than the 50% of the GDP, increasing the importance of an efficient supply chain mangament for service industries. However, to adapt the supply chain management to service companies it most be understanded all the facts around services and the possibility of adapting an existing supply chain model. On the other hand, Servitization is a term referring to the integration of services to a manufacturing company which increased the importance of managing services. This strategy implies changes in the supply chain of manufacturing companies that can be used as a foundation for the service supply chain. Having two different terms that converge in the servitized supply chain, leads the research to the comparison in a statistically way of 'servitization' and 'service supply chain'. The comparison of both topics is done with a bibliometric analysis, using maps done with the Vosviewer software. The bibliometric maps are based on the results of a systematic search, obtaining 211 articles for servitization and 72 for the service supply chain. At the end of this paper a discussion of the results is given. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={At a time where available data is rapidly increasing in both volume and variety, descriptive data mining (DM) can be an important tool to support meaningful decision-making processes in dynamic supply chain (SC) contexts. Up until now, however, scarce attention has been given to the application of DM techniques in the field of inventory management. Here, we take advantage of descriptive DM to detect and grasp important patterns among several features that coexist in a real-world automotive SC. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to analyse and understand the interrelations between ten quantitative and dependent variables in a multi-item/multi-supplier environment. Afterwards, the principal component scores are characterised via a K-means clustering, allowing us to classify the samples into four clusters and to derive different profiles for the multiple inventory items. This work provides evidence that descriptive DM contributes to find interesting feature-patterns, resulting in the identification of important risk profiles that may effectively leverage inventory management for improved SC performance.

abstract={Circular economy is an alternative to the traditional production model and has therefore attracted a great deal of attention fromresearchers. The change in the production system is accompanied by new logistical needs related both to resources and waste and to the distribution and recovery of products. The circular supply chain involves return processes and the manufacturer intends to capture additional value in the supply chain. In this paper, value chains have been mapped to visualize the links and interactions between the different stages and actors to understand the complexities of these systems and to make informed decisions. For this reason, and based on thorough literature review, the final objective of this work is to achieve a conceptual framework to study circular supply chain, which uses the main theoretical perspectives in strategic management literature. Four dimensions have been identified to support the development of these new supply chains-greater intensity in the relationships established in the supply chain, adaptation of logistics and organizational, disruptive and smart technologies, and a functioning environment. It can be concluded that to develop a new relationship capacity will allow for reaching more frequent, closer relationships with more actors. These relationships will be developed within an adapted organizational and logistical framework that is framed in new business model archetypes. However, dimensions related to the business environment such as sectoral, legislative, and fiscal frameworks must be incorporated. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Due to the competitive market, the organizations look for performance improvement in their supply chain activities. Lean principles aim to reduce waste, and many research works have explored their effectiveness in the supply chain. Yet, industries face the problem of selecting appropriate lean supply chain management practices for their present environment. The present study performed a detailed literature study to identify majorly adapted lean supply chain management practices and generalize the most important ones with lesser implementation issues. For this purpose, the multi-criteria decision-making approaches, namely, gray relational analysis and complex proportional assessment of alternatives, are used to rank the identified lean supply chain management practices. Principal component analysis was used to generate criteria weights for computations. Out of 28 selected lean supply chain management practices from the literature, seven high-priority lean supply chain management practices are recommended as a generalized list as a result of prioritization by multi-criteria decision-making approaches such as total quality management, just-in-time production, pull system/kanban, 5S, information technology, work standardization, and customer relationship management. This study will benefit the practitioners to quickly identify suitable lean supply chain management practices to enhance their supply chain network, which can result in substantial cost savings. © IMechE 2022.},

The investigation shows how the framework can be applied, demonstrating that it provides a practical route map for organisations to follow. The four steps include: classify the supply chain, identify and analyse uncertainties, optimise pipelines and develop strategic flexibility. Example outputs are presented for each framework step from the empirical investigation. The principal academic contribution is the structured approach provided by the framework, and in doing so, it consolidates and establishes relationships between fields and concepts. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: Climate vulnerability assessments are often operationalized by the analysis of indicators defined by the spatial boundaries of the community under study. These, however, sometimes fail to capture interdependency among communities for basic resources. This paper aims to propose a framework for characterizing vulnerability caused by interdependency by adapting a supply chain lens. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a definition for “indirect vulnerability” that recognizes the transboundary and teleconnected nature of vulnerability arising from resource networks among cities and communities. A conceptual framework using a supply chain approach is presented for climate hazards in particular. This approach is then demonstrated through a rapid appraisal of the rice, energy and water supply chains and the waste management chains of Metro Manila. Findings: The application of the supply chain lens to assessing the indirect vulnerability of Metro Manila brings to fore issues extending beyond the decision-making boundaries of local government units. Addressing these will require vertical government coordination and horizontal inter-sectoral collaboration. Thus, this supply chain-based indirect vulnerability assessment can be complementary to traditional vulnerability assessments in providing a larger systems perspective. Originality/value: Innovative tools are needed to make community vulnerability assessments both holistic and tractable. Existing methods in the private sector can be adapted rather than reinventing the wheel. This supply chain framework can be a useful decision support and planning tool across governance levels to comprehensively address vulnerability. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper aims to investigate the impact of lean, resilient and green supply chain management practices on supply chain sustainability. A deductive research approach was used to derive a conceptual model. Eighteen research propositions are suggested and tested with empirical data derived from five case studies belonging to the Portuguese automotive supply chain. A conceptual model to assess the impact of lean, resilient and green practices on supply chain sustainability was derived from the data analysis. The practices with significant impact on supply chain sustainability are: "waste elimination," "supply chain risk management" and "cleaner production." The following lean, resilient and green supply chain management practices do not have a significant impact on supply chain sustainability: "flexible transportation," "flexible sourcing," "ISO 14001 certification," and "reverse logistics." The paper provides a taxonomy for lean, resilient and green supply chain management practices at three levels: upstream, organization and downstream. Practitioners can use this taxonomy as a checklist to identify possible practices to achieve their sustainability goals. The proposed model makes it possible for researchers to develop surveys in order to better explore the proposed relationships. This paper presents an innovative approach since it studies simultaneously the three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, social and economic), and the lean, resilient and green supply chain management paradigms which are considered strategic for supply chain competitiveness. Identification of the conceptual relationships between supply chain management practices and sustainability is a contribution that the authors hope will become a forward step in the development of new theoretical approaches and empirical research in the field of supply chain management and sustainability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of process simplification on the relationship between process integration and upstream supply chain flexibility in Indian automotive organizations. Design/methodology/approach: The three-step mediation analysis was performed using SPSS macro PROCESS to assess the mediating role of process simplification on the relationship between process integration constructs: top management commitment and supplier relationship; and upstream supply chain flexibility. Findings: The results indicate a complete mediation effect of process simplification between supplier relationship and upstream supply chain flexibility, while partial mediation effect is noticed between top management commitment and upstream supply chain flexibility. Practical implications: For Indian automotive managers, the study suggests that for improving the upstream supply chain flexibility, organizations must have a strategy towards improving the simplification of supply chain processes by upgrading technology and providing training to their suppliers. This understanding will help the automotive managers to simplify their upstream supply chain processes for gaining competitive positioning and maximizing the organizational profit. Originality/value: This study has considered the mediating role of process simplification (a relatively less studied variable) specifically in the context of its impact on upstream supply chain flexibility. Also, the presented study explores this role in the Indian automotive domain which further enhances its value for both practitioners and researchers alike. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify and rank the contextual relationship among the quality management (QM) constructs for manufacturing and its related service organizations providing integrated value bundles, which has got limited research attention. Design/methodology/approach: The QM constructs of manufacturing and services are selected by performing the citation analysis. Studies related to manufacturing and service are selected by reviewing their citations index in the three major research databases namely ProQuest, Scopus and Google Scholar. The subjective responses from both industry and academia are taken in order to gain better understanding of the contextual relationship among the QM constructs. Finally, an integrated model is proposed using Micmac analysis and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). Findings: The citation analysis lead to identification of 12 QM constructs: top management commitment, supplier relationship management, human resource management, strategic focus, customer focus, quality of information sharing, process management, servicescape, employee involvement, service quality, supply chain flexibility and customer satisfaction. The expert opinions of executives in the automotive industry and academia resulted in the development of contextual relationships among the identified QM constructs for the development of an ISM model, which is a major contribution of this study. Originality/value: The unique focus of this study is on analyzing the contextual relationship among QM aspects in manufacturing and services as clubbed offering. The researchers in the existing literature have so far differentiated between manufacturing and services but this study integrates the QM constructs for manufacturing and its associated services through expert feedback and proposes an ISM model. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Resilient supply chains are designed and operated to deal with disruptive events in an efficient manner. In ICT product supply chains, disruptions are often observed as vulnerabilities discovered in components used in the products. The vulnerabilities can be associated with the components themselves as well as with suppliers, and they can be averted by patching and supply chain reconfiguration. The paper elaborates a simulation model for analyzing relationships between the cost of treating the vulnerabilities and the supply chain configuration. We show that flexible supply chain configurations have the lowest cost and are the most resilient to vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities associated with suppliers, for example, due to the loss of their trustworthiness, cause more-significant fluctuations in supply chain performance than the vulnerabilities associated with individual components. The monitoring cost have a significant impact on the selection of the most-resilient configuration. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Until now, the complex relationship between energy security and climate change has been addressed using a partial understanding of security, one that is based on simplified indicators such as import dependence or fuel mix diversity. As a consequence, the synergies and trade-offs between climate change and energy security policies have not been systematically explored according to a wider understanding of the latter concept. The purpose of this article is to resolve the resulting knowledge gap by proposing a theoretical approach to energy security that is consistent with its multi-dimensional nature, taking into account the whole energy supply chain. Five key 'systemic' properties of energy security will be identified - namely, stability, flexibility, adequacy, resilience and robustness. The paper proposes a novel framework to assess energy security and uses this framework to develop a comprehensive approach to the interactions between climate change policies and energy security. The impact of a low-carbon scenario on one of these five properties (long-term robustness) will be assessed using a complex multi-regional energy system model. The results demonstrate how this scenario induces structural changes along the whole energy supply chain, revealing dynamic vulnerabilities and trade-offs that are not adequately accounted for by existing indicator-based assessments. Finally, the paper provides solid foundations for further analysis of these trade-offs using more detailed sectoral models. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Nowadays, OEMs from many domains (e.g., electronics and automotive) face rising pressure from customers and legal regulations to produce more sustainable products. This involves the reporting and publishing of various sustainability indicators. However, the demands of legal entities and customers constitute a tremendous challenge as products  in these domains comprise various components and sub-components provided by suppliers. Hence, sustainability data collection must be executed along the entire supply chain. In turn, this involves a myriad of different automated and manual tasks as well as quickly changing situations. In combination with potentially long-running processes, these issues result in great process variability that cannot be predicted at design time. In the Sustain Hub project, a dedicated information system for supporting data collection processes is developed. This paper provides three contributions: (1) it identifies core challenges for sustainable supply chain communication, (2) it reviews state-of-the-art technical solutions for such challenges, and (3) it gives a first overview of the approach we are developing in the Sustain Hub project to address the challenges. By achieving that, this comprehensive approach has the potential to unify and simplify supply chain communication in the future. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.},

Trade mark law has contributed to the development of firms and to the rise of powerful business actors that rely on strong marketing presences based on brands to attract demand, but use flexible supply chains to meet this demand. This article considers the relationship between trade marks and brands and the kinds of corporate power to which brands can contribute. It shows how brands have enabled some firms to transform their activities in response to changing economic and social conditions and even to transform themselves as business actors.

The paper aims to identify and analyze the resilience of small farmers in southern Romania (i.e., Bucharest Metropolitan Area) to the new conditions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. By combining quantitative and qualitative approaches, the analysis focused on the COVID-19 pandemic pre-conditions, impacts and resilience, as well as the post-COVID-19 solutions - the medium- and long-term measures necessary to sustain the effort of the farmers to cope with risks and uncertainties in the future. The study shows a close connection between some pre-existing conditions and farms capacity to become resilient to the shocks caused by the pandemic. Hence, organic farms demonstrated the highest resilience, while leisure and recreational farms the lowest. The research has improved the existing knowledge on the sub-urban farmers as key players of metropolitan agriculture and promoters of sustainability and food security for cities and identified some elements of resilience during COVID-19: reconnecting with local food production, networking, door-to-door delivery, multi-functionality inside the farm, etc. Particularly, backing small farmers to meet market requirements and access digital marketing are among the key measures to support local food systems and short food supply chains to adapt to future shocks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A well-established distribution network is fundamental to the sound management of the green supply chain. To adapt to the market demand and policies for green products, it is urgent to build an efficient and rational logistic distribution network for the green supply chain. Many researchers have tried to design distribution networks through the coordinated optimization of the green supply chain, in the light of realistic situation. However, there are very few optimization models that consider all kinds of influencing factors. To solve the problem, this paper attempts to establish a coordinated optimization model of the complex system of the green supply chain distribution network (GSCDN). Firstly, the authors plotted the structure and game logic of the GSCDN and defined the upper limit of sales induced by the limited production capacity of producers. Secondly, the coordinated optimization conditions were configured for the distributor layer, producer layer, and market demand layer, and a coordinated optimization model was set up for the complex system. Finally, the contractual coordinated optimization mechanism was detailed for the complex system under the profit-sharing contract. The proposed model and solving algorithm were proved valid through experiments. © 2021 Yurong Guan et al.},

abstract={The rapid growth of the emerging markets has pushed the automotive original equipment manufacturers to relocalize production to reduce manufacturing and logistic costs. To ensure an efficient and flexible supply chain, local suppliers are appointed. However, the characteristics of materials available in each region may have minor differences, and when geometry and process design recommendations that were developed for certain materials are implemented for materials under a different regional standard, different results are obtained. Such is the case of the clutch disc spacer bolt, in which its compression during riveting has a direct effect in the noise and vibration isolation of the vehicle. It has been reported that spacer bolts produced with materials considered to be equivalent in Europe and North America (DIN C10C and SAE-AISI 1010 steels) behave different during riveting, even though they have very similar chemical compositions and are delivered with a similar UTS and ductility. The aim of this paper is to compare the compression behavior of both materials during riveting, and to explain the factors affecting the material response during compression that lead to differences in the final geometry. Finite element simulations are used for the analysis and validated experimentally by a controlled prototype production. Results indicated that 1010 steel compresses in average 0.3 mm more than C10C steel, caused by the yield stress difference. Experimental results were within the simulation results range. Microstructural analysis and microhardness measurements are reported in order to explain the deformation mechanisms. Finally, a change in the spacer bolt barrel dimension prior riveting is proposed based on finite element simulations to overcome their differences and produce a rivet under specification.

Within supply networks, interrelationships and mutual connections among supply risks often create additional challenges for risk monitoring. During normal operation, risk interrelationships remain largely hidden until the occurrence of a specific risk. Understanding these interrelationships is therefore important to increase the effectiveness of risk monitoring. In this paper, the interrelationships between supply risks are quantified and supply risks are categorized according to their role within the system. We follow a network oriented approach as defined by system theory. Our explorative research utilizes data from expert evaluations in selected case companies and emphasizes that strong interrelationships and mutual connections exist between supply risks. We draw on these findings to establish a small and efficient set of key supply risk indicators, making the results highly relevant for executives seeking to improve risk monitoring. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative evidence of natural disasters’ (NDs) effect on corporate performance and studies the mechanisms through which the supply chain moderates and mediates the link. Design/methodology/approach: Using two major NDs as quasi-experiment, namely the 2011 Japanese earthquake-tsunami (JET) and Thai flood (TF), and data over the period 2010Q1-2013Q4, effect of these events on end assemblers’ performance is studied, with a focus on the personal computer (PC) supply chain. The moderating influence of delivery and sourcing – as supply chain flexibility and agility – are examined through end assemblers’ and suppliers’ inventory. The suppliers’ mediating role is captured as disruption in obtaining PC components through their sales. Findings: Only JET had any negative effect, further quantified as short-term and long-term. The TF instead portrays an insignificant but positive aftermath, which is construed as showing learning from experience and adaptability following JET. Inventory matters, but differently for the two events, and suppliers only exhibit a moderating influence on the assemblers’ disaster-performance link. Originality/value: NDs, as catastrophic vulnerabilities, are distinct from other vulnerabilities in that they are hard to predict and have significant impact. Since little is known about the impact of NDs on firm performance and how supply chain mechanisms moderate or mediate their impact, they should be distinctly modelled and empirically studied from other vulnerabilities. This paper sheds light on supply chain resilience to such events with the role of dynamic capabilities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this paper, a supply chain reconfiguration problem for manufacturing enterprise systems was investigated. An optimization model was formulated to minimize the total cost of the supply chain network with the consideration of manufacturing operations and reconfiguration cost. To effectively model the reconfiguration cost of the supply chain, a graph-based method was proposed to characterize the similarity between supply chain configurations and to establish the relationship between the similarity index and reconfiguration cost.

abstract={Supply chain plays a prominent role in any business activity. In order to make supply chains more responsive and efficient, we need to identify the vulnerabilities and risk involved in supply chains. The supply chain of an organisation depends upon six driving factors; information, inventory, sourcing, pricing, facility and transportation. We classify various risks in supply chains that influence the six major drivers of it; say for example under inventory; the fluctuation of demand, capacity limitations, stock out of products etc. Similarly, under information; the risks can be legal and regulatory risk, government laws or new tax implementation, lack of point of sale (POS) data, IT cyber security, customer data mishandling, anticipating bullwhip effect etc. And under facility drivers, the associated risks can include centralised or localised production, availability for stock keeping unit and lack of proper data storage, etc. Likewise, under transportation; the major risk factors includes poor logistic supply at supplier end and increased demand for responsiveness, shorter lead times, and shorter window for on time delivery of products, etc. Also, we observe that each driver in supply chain can represent a cluster of several risks, of which some of them are listed above. We study the risk factors using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) the causal relations among risk clusters were studied using DEMATEL analysis. We also use the fish bone diagram for representation of cause and effect relationship between the risk factors within a particular cluster. The whole exercise is to prioritise the risk factors based on their causal importance and the study is based on a questionnaire based survey. Overall, managers are benefitted, as the risk factors can be prioritised and the principal causal drivers under each cluster of risks can be identified using FMEA and DEMATEL for the case of Indian manufacturing industries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Circular economy (CE) is a very wide concept, and it is spreading worldwide. With time as the population is increasing so is the pressure on limited natural resources. So, it is required to implement CE at every stage in a supply chain to make it sustainable. Every organization needs a proper balance between customer satisfaction and environmental health to cope up with future challenges. The CE is rapidly gaining momentum among business spearheads and officials in Europe, China, and other developed countries while its capability has been ignored by the developing countries so far. However, India, one of the developing countries is making an effort to crack climate-resilient development, and national legislators are investing in CE. For implementing CE in any supply chain, it is necessary to see every aspect whether it is environmental or economical. Every organization needs an ideal supply chain performance system (SCPS) to keep track of its resources and manage them effectively. An attempt has been made to make the supply chain more flexible and sustainable by identifying and assessing its hurdles. Several critical hurdles that are an obstacle for the implementation of CE in many developing countries are found out with the support of literature available, academician, and field experts. Then Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) has been applied to recognize the relationship among the hurdles. A set of directly and indirectly related hurdles are structured into a comprehensive systematic model and the matrix of cross-impact multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis has been done to categorize these hurdles into four groups, viz., autonomous, linkage, independent, and dependent. After identifying hurdles falling into the linkage cluster, prioritization has been done by using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Prioritization of the hurdles will help the decision-maker to decide the available criteria (viz. hurdles). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Global businesses are leveraging their analytical capabilities to develop competence over others. This study uses Organization Information Processing Theory (OIPT) in context to explain the relationship between the smart supply chain and information system flexibility to achieve an overall greater supply chain flexibility. Also, this shows that correct deployment of information processing leads to better diffusion of information throughout the system necessary for making the supply chain more adaptive in nature. This study extends the application of OIPT theory and a better understanding of analytical data processing and theoretically grounded guidance to managers in order to achieve a higher degree of flexibility in dynamic conditions. The Partial Least Square Method based on Structural Equation Modeling is used to empirically test the theoretical framework. Results from the analysis of 150 respondents indicate the strong relationship between the components of the smart supply chain and information systems agility. The research shows a positive relationship between the characteristics of smart supply chain management and modules of information system flexibility which leads to the achievement of a high level of supply chain flexibility. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Supply chain catchment sea-fish requires good management in order to produce good quality of fish and high selling price. As the logistics costs incur from each tier along the supply chain, it must be managed to control and balance the quality and quantity with the price of fish along the supply chain. The aim of this research is analyzed the logistics cost structure of catchment sea-fish and then provide alternative supply chain strategy. Moreover, convenience and snowball sampling were used as the sampling method, while in-depth interview was employed to collect information from respondents including fishermen, ship owner, collector, trader, fish processing unit's staff and fish auction facility's staff. This research is undertaken in 5 provinces in Java, namely Special Region of Yogyakarta, Central Java, East Java, West Java, and DKI Jakarta. Processing and measurement of logistics cost is done by determining the average logistics cost and the average proportion of logistics cost. In summary, suitable strategy to be applied are responsive supply chain strategy for fisherman and efficient supply chain strategy for traders and collectors. The strategy for the whole supply chain is the push supply chain strategy. © 2018 IEEE.},

A sample survey was conducted to get the perspectives of small business owners in retail and consumers to understand their perspective on dynamic consumer pricing and its effects on logistics. The survey questions were structured in a way to provide perspectives on consumer experience and buying behaviour concerning dynamic pricing and gamification. The study realized retail companies are not well prepared for the logistical changes due to dynamic pricing. Traditionally, retail stores have focused on ensuring that the supply chain is responsive to client demands. For instance, leftover inventory was seen as a problem arising from poor decisions on dynamic pricing. After a promotional selling season, many of the retail respondents indicated that they face problems of when and how much to mark down leftover inventory. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Using uncertain real-time information to update supply chain operational policies creates a need for developing dynamic supply chain management capabilities that increase responsiveness to demand and decrease volatility of the replenishment process. Firstly,the determination of decentralized inventory decisions are investigated when the two parties optimize their individual inventory-related costs in a noncooperative manner. Then a optimized control strategy is proposed to manage the inventory replenishment process in a supply chain system under different forecast situations.

The main objective is to maintain the inventory level at a desired one according to the customer demand while synchronizing the flows within a set of physical boundaries and constraints. In addition, we consider uncertainties on delay and adaptation times and we use the new setting of the algebraic estimation techniques to adapt and update the controller when any change occurs. These two methods lead to a simple design of the control algorithm without integration of any differential equation and without a need to any model to estimate, which yield to an efficient control action.

The paper focuses on the operational activities of supply-chains, the main objective is to maintain the inventory level at a desired one according to the customer demand while synchronizing the flows within a set of physical boundaries and constraints.

abstract={IT flexibility is an increasingly important factor in today's dynamic business environment. However, earlier research lacks 1) an integrated framework that corresponds to diverse processes for supply chain management and 2) an explanation of how IT flexibility affects firms’ performance in the supply chain context. To fill these gaps, our study theorised a research model by integrating disparate streams of IT flexibility research with three types of IT flexibility, namely, operational, transactional, and strategic, and tested both the direct and indirect effects of the three IT flexibility types on firm performance. Our theoretical model uses an extended resource-based view to highlight the role of IT flexibility in managing interdependent firm relationships in supply chains. Using a partial least squares approach to structured equation modelling analysis on 162 questionnaires from supply chain practitioners, we found two significant relationships: (1) transactional IT flexibility affects operational IT flexibility, and (2) operational IT flexibility affects strategic IT flexibility. Transactional IT flexibility also affects strategic IT flexibility, thus playing a pivotal role in the effectiveness of the other two flexibility types. In addition, it was identified that transactional and operational flexibilities affect firm performance indirectly, via process integration capability, while strategic flexibility directly affects firm performance. By classifying diverse IT flexibility attributes into three types, a comprehensive and explicit concept of IT flexibility in inter-organisational relationships is attained, which allows practitioners to target key resource investments to realise the full potential of IT in the supply chain. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={This study explores a performance measurement system for a dynamic supply chain partnership in a cross-cultural context. An initial framework is constructed by reviewing the existing literature, followed by an in-depth case study in the Chinese automotive industry, where the framework is refined to address the multi-cultural setting. A performance measurement, system which includes the relationship strategy and operational measurement criteria for a supply chain partnership, has been developed. The relationship strategy contains elements of strategy orientation, management style, interdependence, mutual organisational characteristics and common goals. The operational measurement criteria consist of commitment, trust, communication behaviour, information sharing, participation decision, quality, production performance, delivery, cost, supplier strength, attitude, compromise and loyalty. The last three operational measurement criteria are found to be particularly relevant to the cross-cultural feature. While existing studies tend to focus on either specific measures or individual organisations, this paper for the first time proposes a comprehensive framework to measure the performance of supply chain partnerships. The cross-cultural perspective provides a further unique view on how a performance measurement system can be responsive to the dynamics in practice. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Policy Points Reflecting on current response deficiencies, we offer a model for a national contingency supply chain cell (NCSCC) construct to manage the medical materials supply chain in support of emergencies, such as COVID-19. We develop the following: a framework for governance and response to enable a globally independent supply chain; a flexible structure to accommodate the requirements of state and county health systems for receiving and distributing materials; and a national material “control tower” to improve transparency and real-time access to material status and location. Context: Much of the discussion about the failure of the COVID-19 supply chain has centered on personal protective equipment (PPE) and the degree of vulnerability of care. Prior research on supply chain risks have focused on mitigating the risk of disruptions of specific purchased materials within a bounded region or on the shifting status of cross-border export restrictions. But COVID-19 has impacted every purchase category, region, and border. This paper is responsive to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommendation to study and monitor disasters and to provide governments with course of action to satisfy legislative mandates. Methods: Our analysis draws on our observations of the responses to COVID-19 in regard to acquisition and contracting problem-solving, our review of field discussions and interactions with experts, a critique of existing proposals for managing the strategic national stockpile in the United States a mapping of the responses to national contingency planning phases, and the identification of gaps in current national healthcare response policy frameworks and proposals. Findings: Current proposals call for augmenting a system that has failed to deliver the needed response to COVID-19. These proposals do not address the key attributes for pandemic plan renewal: flexibility, traceability and transparency, persistence and responsiveness, global independence, and equitable access. We offer a commons-based framework for achieving the opportunities and risks which are responsive to a constellation of intelligence assets working in and across focal targets of global supply chain risk. Conclusions: The United States needs a “commons-based strategy” that is not simply a stockpile repository but instead is a network of repositories, fluid inventories, and analytic monitoring governed by the experts. We need a coordinated effort, a “commons” that will direct both conventional and new suppliers to meet demands and to eliminate hoarding and other behaviors. © 2020 Milbank Memorial Fund},

abstract={Today's manufacturing companies are measured by how fast they meet the customer and user requirements, how responsive they are to the changing market demands and how capable they are in producing good quality products and supply them at optimal cost. Lean manufacturing is a manufacturing concept which has demonstrated results of successful implementation especially in discrete manufacturing companies. This paper presents a case study of an Indian pharmaceutical firm to outline the scope of a successful lean based manufacturing strategy implementation in this sector. Analytic Network Process (ANP) is applied to measure and rate the present leanness of a pharmaceutical firm. A multi-level model along with the questionnaires developed by the authors was used for the initial assessment. The approach helped to assess the current leanness level. Since inhibitors for lean interventions were identified the authors studied them and established the correlation among different parameters using Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach. The model was also validated through MICMAC analysis. The results of ANP, ISM and MICMAC showed the root causes for the unsuccessful implementation of lean in the firm. They were the lack of a responsive supply chain and the excessive Quality regulations and enforcements by the Authorities. This study gives guidelines to companies planning for lean implementation to deploy methods to remove the inhibitors of lean at the initial stages. Identifying the barriers can guide managers in developing strategies to eliminate them at the inception. This paper recommends supplier qualification programmes which managers can use to get the suppliers be part of their extended lean family. Through this supplier's involvement can be improved with an aim of improving the product lead time. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Supply chain management intends to integrate supply chains' activities such as material flow, information flow and financial issues. Material flow management is the most significant issue since the inventory level in the whole supply chain could be optimized by an integrated plan. In other words, when one member of the supply chain plans to reduce its inventory level solely, despite reducing inventory in this node the inventory will be stocked in other partners' warehouses. Therefore, in this paper a new mathematical model has been developed to facilitate the process of finding the optimum solution in economic production, purchase and delivery lots and their schedules in a three-echelon supply chain environment; including raw material in suppliers, manufacturer and assembly facility as a customer. The manufacturer with a flow shop system provides its requirements from supplier, assemble multiple products, and delivers products to the customer (automotive OEM alike) on an optimum multiple delivery points. The delivery cycles would be identified through the production common cycle regarding the supply chain flexibility. Finally, a modified real-valued Genetic Algorithm (MRGA), and an Optimal Enumeration Method (OEM) are developed, and some numerical experiments have been done and compared as well. © 2021 The Author(s).},

abstract={The aim of this research was to explore the development model of cacao industry with sectoral competitive advantage. More specifically, the purposes of this research were to examine and explain the effects of market orientation, supply chain flexibility and strategic location toward competitive advantage in cacao agro-industry. Design used in this research was explanatory research with process of data collection through survey method by using questionnaire. Unit analysis of this research was leaders/managers of cacao industry. Data analysis method used is the generalized structured component analysis. Findings of this research show that market orientation and strategic location have positive effect and significant toward competitive advantage. But, supply chain flexibility has no significant effect towards competitive advantage. Furthermore, control variable of institutional economic has positive and significant effect towards competitive advantage. Practical implication can give understanding and information for managers of cacao industry in implementing their market orientation, supply chain flexibility and market strategy by assessing the ability of partner supply chain to respond market changes in obtaining and maintaining the competitive advantage. Limitation of this study is that in delivering the analysis, analysis relation of cross sectional was limited to respondents, manager/leaders only. Further researches need to involve cacao farmers, customers, government and business partners in the sampling. Besides that, commodity which was focused was very specific that is cacao industry. Therefore, put in concern about factors of season and farmers involvement need to get serious attention. Originality of this research can prove and explain integration of conceptual model in structural relation among market orientation, strategic location, and supply chain flexibility in improving competitive advantage. Furthermore, this research also gives empirical evidence of the role of variable control of institutional economic has significant effect towards competitive advantage. © 2016, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.},

abstract={Purpose: Circular economy (CE) initiatives are taking hold across both developed and developing nations. Central to these initiatives is the reconfiguration of core supply chain management (SCM) processes that underlie current production and consumption patterns. This conceptual article provides a detailed discussion of how supply chain processes can support the successful implementation of CE. The article highlights areas of convergence in hopes of sparking collaboration among scholars and practitioners in SCM, CE, and related fields. Design/methodology/approach: This article adopts a theory extension approach to conceptual development that uses CE as a “method” for exploring core processes within the domain of SCM. The article offers a discussion of the ways in which the five principles of CE (closing, slowing, intensifying, narrowing, dematerialising loops) intersect with eight core SCM processes (customer relationship management, supplier relationship management, customer service management, demand management, order fulfilment, manufacturing flow management, product development and commercialization, returns management). Findings: This article identifies specific ways in which core SCM processes can support the transition from traditional linear approaches to production and consumption to a more circular approach. This paper results in a conceptual framework and research agenda for researchers and practitioners working to adapt current supply chain processes to support the implementation of CE. Originality/value: This article highlights key areas of convergence among scholars and practitioners through a systematic extension of CE principles into the domain of SCM. In so doing, the paper lays out a potential agenda for collaboration among these groups. © 2020, Benjamin T. Hazen, Ivan Russo, Ilenia Confente and Daniel Pellathy.},

abstract={This paper studies the impact of bilateral participation strategy on the dynamic emission-reducing behaviors and associated performance of low-carbon supply chains using differential game models. We first consider a dyadic supply chain comprising one supplier and one manufacturer in the base model and derive the equilibrium solutions of dynamic emission abatement in decentralized and centralized systems, respectively. In the decentralized supply chain, we consider both unilateral sharing and bilateral participation contracts and examine the feedback equilibrium strategies and trajectories of emission abatement of all parties. By comparison, we find that the bilateral contract leads to lower emission abatement and higher profits of all players and the system than that under unilateral sharing contract. Meanwhile, we show that the properly-designed bilateral participation contract can coordinate the decentralized dyadic supply chain. By extending the base model, we further figure out the equilibria and optimal trajectories for the dynamic cooperative emission abatement and the associated mechanism design in a supply chain with two competing suppliers and one manufacturer. Interestingly, we find that the bilateral participation contract can also coordinate the competing channels with competitive or complementary components at the upstream level. We uncover that the bilateral participation contract is effective in coordinating supply chains with dynamic cooperative emission abatement since it can overcome the disadvantage of uneven distribution of emission-reducing capability endowments among chain members. Finally, we also conduct computational and sensitivity analyses to illustrate the previous results. These findings provide potential implications for firms’ dynamic cooperation in emission abatement. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Along with carbon emission regulations launched by governments and consumers’ rising concerns about climate changes and global carbon footprint, interests of academia and industry have risen in carbon-efficient supply chain management. This research focuses on some product supply chain to make a literature review-based investigation on proposing a theoretical framework. We also solve potential research issues of how diverse carbon emission regulations can work on supply chain performance as well as emission; in what way we can find coordination mechanisms and optimal policies for supply chain operations to abate emission and enhance system profitability within different scenarios; and also to evaluate the effect on emission reduction for each emission regulation aforementioned through comparing their associated supply chain performances and system emission. Both practitioners in industry and academia might find this study useful, as it generates concepts with a formal framework of potential and values theoretical issues in the emerging field of carbon-efficient supply chain management which combines carbon emission regulations with mature operation management to enrich the theory of supply chain management. This study is perhaps to be valuable and constructive both for operational decisions in firms and for the enactment as well as implementation of emission-reduction regulations.

abstract={The fashion industry is adapting to the new situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by changing the structure of its supply chain, much like other industries that experience exogenous shocks. The pandemic affected conditions of apparel retailers: downstream among consumers and upstream among suppliers. It induced retailers to accelerate the adoption of technologies to make their supply chains more flexible and resilient. Before COVID-19, the apparel industry had gradually adopted virtual dressing room (VDR) technologies and crowd wisdom software, both of which reduce the risk associated with online purchases. Apparel retailers also altered the structure of their supply chains by outsourcing product turns via third-party logistics providers. This article analyzes how changes in market demand and supply conditions following the outbreak of COVID-19 accelerated the adoption of VDR technologies. The analysis is based on a conceptual microeconomic model of adopting technologies and changes in the supply chain. We support our theoretical findings with business cases. Understanding the nonlinear relationships among changes in demand, supply chains, and retail technology adoption triggered by exogenous shocks is essential for managers and affects the quality of service. © 2022 INFORMS},

abstract={The microbial formation of trimethylamine (TMA) can be used as a quality indicator compound to predict the freshness of fish during its shelf life. In a supply chain with fluctuating temperatures, mathematical models will be valuable tools to simulate this formation as a function of temperature and time. These models are essential to link sensor data on the formation of TMA to the actual freshness of fish. Existing models for the formation of TMA in fish needed improvements and secondary models for the effect of temperature on the formation of TMA are lacking in the literature. Three different approaches were evaluated on their ability to simulate the experimental observed TMA formation at 4 different temperatures (0, 5, 10 and 15°C). In the first approach the existing models were improved and the temperature effect was modelled by an empirical model using four parameters. This model is able to simulate the TMA formation at static temperatures. Since TMA is produced on fresh cod fillets by the micro-organisms Shewanella putrefaciens and Photobacterium phosphoreum the microbial Baranyi-Roberts model was initially used for modelling the TMA formation, but this model was found to be too complex (too many correlated parameters that could not be estimated). In the third approach it was seen that a simplified Baranyi-Roberts model with only three parameters could be used to predict the TMA formation with equal accuracy. The influence of the temperature on the parameter μmax was modelled using the extended square root model of Ratkowsky and the differences in TMA formation profiles of different batches could be described by the batch specific parameter N0 representing the initial quality. The presented dynamic model is valuable in predicting the formation of TMA in a fresh fish supply chain with dynamic temperatures. This model has the potential to be used to link sensor data of TMA in the headspace to the actual freshness status of the fish. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The different areas of the digital transformation of supply chains, namely the strategic, organizational, process & method, and technological area are considered. Preconditions and challenges for companies in the digital transformation of their supply chain are extracted from literature with literature reviews and followingly discussed with practitioners to capture the magnitude of the transformation process. Furthermore, differences between academia and practice are revealed, and future research opportunities are identified. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The main purpose of this paper is the allocation of orders to suppliers in an agile and flexible manner suitable to the automobile industry. In this paper, parts supplied by a single source were eliminated from the set of parts. Using mathematical modeling and through the interval-valued fuzzy-rough numbers best worst method (IVFRN-BWM), we try to achieve the results that can meet the proposed model's needs and provide the ideal results by introducing new modes. This paper addressed some new aspects of the subject and achieved robust results by considering five objective functions. These five functions are as follows: minimization of production line disruptions due to the performance of suppliers, minimization of the complaints of production line about supplied parts, minimization of defective parts received from suppliers (PPM), maximization of on-time delivery services, and minimization of overall costs of supplied parts. Reviewing the literature, the originality of this study are as follows: 1) identifying the structure of a supply chain (SC) in general and particularly in an automobile industry SC; 2) investigating the modeling techniques of the existing SC models for coordinating all the members of a product SC; 3) building a hybrid model of IVFRN-BWM and a robust goal programming agile and flexible supply chain in an uncertain situation; and 4) identifying the suitable scenarios/cases for testing the proposed models to validate the models. This paper can help decision makers and managers to opt for the best suppliers and also allocate the right numbers of parts to those supplier(s) based on a real situation of each firm. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid increase in consumption of products and services is leading to the scarcity of resources and environmental crisis. The circular economy was born as a new economic model to solve these problems. It explores new techniques to rethink and redesign products and services and extend their useful life through reusing, remanufacturing, recycling, etc., to maximize the value of resources. The implementation of the circular model entails the adaptation of supply chains. In connection with sustainability, we also need to consider economic, social and environmental dimensions. This makes the evaluation of the circular systems more complex. In the past, various means are presented in the literature to evaluate and understand the sustainable dimensions for the development of the circular economy. However, the evaluation methods and the indicators are heterogeneous. Thus, it is very challenging to obtain standardized information that the different stakeholders will understand. In this paper, through a literature review, we seek to understand the measurement of the sustainable dimensions in the performance of the circular supply chains. This research is part of a thesis work, which aims to study sustainable performance in circular supply chains, grouping economic, management and industrial engineering aspects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

abstract={Background: Organizational failure in food markets is a potential threat to food security. Thus, a greater understanding of the factors that influence organizational failure and reduce supply chain resilience is essential to underpin agile and dynamic food supply chains. Scope and approach: The aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of system level factors that influence organizational failure in food supply chains in order to conceptualize the horizontal and vertical interaction of such factors at the three levels described: the micro system, the meso system and the macro system level. A systematic review, based on a specific search strategy, incorporated articles from the fields of management, business and economics research. Whilst 616 articles were initially identified, only 41 of these were within the established inclusion criteria and reviewed. A model of organizational failure, determined here as “The House of Cards Model”, is developed, that can then be empirically tested in further research. Key findings and conclusions: A hierarchy was developed to contextualize the factors deemed to be of influence. The macro (external environment) level includes criteria such as economic conditions, formal institutions, government policies, competitors and rumors. The factors addressed in the meso (organizational) level include organization age and size, location, property structure, client, supplier and shareholder relationships, financial resources, physical resources, human resources and succession process. At the micro (individual) level the managers’ skill, characteristics, actions and mindset are of influence. This paper contributes to advancing the debate and underpins further empirical research on organizational failure in food supply chains. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Distributed generation plays an important role for reliable and flexible supply networks. They also have great potential for the integration of renewable energies. In this paper, a hybrid system consisting of a cogeneration, a photovoltaic installation and a lithium-ion battery is investigated. In particular, a methodical approach is presented that allows determining the energetic assessment criteria self-sufficiency and self-consumption rate as a function of the design parameters of the plant. These criteria are used to provide an optimization procedure which enables the installed power of the photovoltaic system and storage capacity of the battery to be specified in such a way as to nearly feasible a virtually grid-independent operation. It is shown that with the help of an average balance the distributed generation can be dimensioned in order to optimize the annual energy production and consumption with respect to the load profile of a residential area and the demand for intermediate storage of electrical energy. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: There is now much emphasis in both research and practice on the principles of circular economies. In this paper remanufacturing is examined as a key enabler of circular practices, and the concept of “Product-Agnostic Manufacturing” (PAR) is proposed. This work differentiates PAR from many traditional approaches to remanufacturing by virtue of PAR's treatment of product variety. Most existing approaches to remanufacturing feature low variety and standardisation; this study instead suggests that the exploitation of flexibilities in both operations and supply chains leads to new competitive strategies for firms to exploit. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual study that builds on a thorough exploration of contemporary remanufacturing literature in the development of the new PAR concept. Findings: Through a detailed literature review it is shown that there are a range of benefits, challenges, and critical success factors that underpin the remanufacturing concept. Building on this understanding and bridging literature in operations flexibility and supply chain design, a detailed discussion on the nature of PAR is provided, and an agenda for future research developed. Originality/value: Whilst there has been much literature on remanufacturing, there is a general tendency to treat supply chain and remanufacturing operations quite distinctly in individual articles. Additionally, there has been little consideration of multi-product remanufacturing, and for the limited studies where this is done, the emphasis is typically on problem avoidance. This study aims to provide a detailed insight into the developed PAR concept, showing how the remanufacture of a wide range of product varieties may be achieved through flexible operations and supply chain design. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In today's complex and dynamic supply chain markets, information systems are essential for effective supply chain management. Complex decision making processes on strategic, tactical, and operational levels require substantial timely support in order to contribute to organizations' agility. Consequently, there is a need for sophisticated dynamic product pricing mechanisms that can adapt quickly to changing market conditions and competitors' strategies. We propose a two-layered machine learning approach to compute tactical pricing decisions in real time. The first layer estimates prevailing economic conditions-economic regimes-identifying and predicting current and future market conditions. In the second layer, we train a neural network for each regime to estimate price distributions in real time using available information. The neural networks compute offer acceptance probabilities from a tactical perspective to meet desired sales quotas. We validate our approach in the trading agent competition for supply chain management. When competing against the world's leading agents, the performance of our system significantly improves compared to using only economic regimes to predict prices. Profits increase significantly even though the prices and sales volume do not change significantly. Instead, tactical pricing results in a more efficient sales strategy by reducing both finished goods and components inventory costs. © 2015 Decision Sciences Institute.},

abstract={Direct digital manufacturing (DDM) is a combination of product modeling and manufacturing technology that directly converts digital models to physical objects without the need for tooling. The capability of DDM to improve the sustainability of products and processes is based on changing operational practices in product design, distribution, use, and after-sales services. Although research has provided evidence of the potential impact of DDM technologies, there is limited research on how specific DDM-based operational practices add to the operational capabilities of a manufacturer and how these capabilities can be used to improve sustainability outcomes. To address this research gap, we evaluate how current and future DDM-based operational practices can be used to improve products and processes. The analyzed current practices are in prototyping, tooling, on-demand parts manufacturing, and customized parts manufacturing. Two future practices that are evaluated are DDM-based incremental product improvement and dynamic supply chain reconfiguration. Based on the evaluation of current and future practices, we propose a design theory for the introduction of DDM into manufacturing firms for improving sustainability capabilities. The key contribution of this article is specifying the mechanisms by which a specific DDM-based operational practice improves sustainability outcomes and how each practice creates an operational practice threshold that needs to be reached before further improvement of capabilities is possible. Thus, using the theory new operational practices can be proactively developed and tested before the next threshold is reached. This in turn will help manufacturers develop strategies and investment plans for current and future DDM-based practices and to accumulate sustainability capabilities faster. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The combination of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and dynamic capabilities theory is a fairly young topic, which has attracted great attention from scholars and practitioners recently. This study empirically investigates the impact of SSCM practices on supply chain (SC) dynamic capabilities and enterprise performance (including economic, environmental and social performance) by explicitly focusing on the mediation effect of SC dynamic capabilities on the link between SSCM practices and enterprise performance. Data collected from 209 Chinese manufacturing firms were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results reveal that SSCM practices have a significant positive effect on SC dynamic capabilities and all three dimensions of performances. Whereas SC dynamic capabilities affect only environmental performance positively, they have no effect on economic performance and social performance. Furthermore our analysis reveals that SC dynamic capabilities partially mediate the relationship between SSCM practices and enterprise performance. Overall, the findings explicate the importance for firms, in particular those operating in developing countries, to reinforce their SC dynamic capabilities and implement effective SSCM practices as an enabler. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To improve the coordination of blood supply and demand, the efficient design of the blood supply chain network (BSCN) is a proper strategy. In this regard, this paper is the first-ever study to strive for a simultaneous investigation on three interdependent challenges of the BSCN: (1) donors motivation, (2) optimizing location and capacity decisions, and (3) controlling the reliability and robustness of the network under combinatorial risk. As in reality, blood donors play a critical role in the BSC; this study undertakes motivational initiatives to encourage blood donors for maintaining sufficient blood supply. Advertisement, education and medical credits are the directions incorporated to construct the motivational function. To observe the efficiency as the most critical factor while evaluating the pool of location alternatives for establishing facilities, an augmented version of data envelopment analysis (DEA) is utilized. In addition, a mixed integer programming model is proposed by which the simultaneous location and capacity decisions are supported. The model is also extended to handle the combinatorial risk of uncertainty as well as disruption. Thus, a novel mixed possibilistic-stochastic flexible robust programming (MPSFRP) is developed. Eventually, the proposed model is implemented in a real case study to assess its practicality and then provide applicable insights for administrators. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent years, rapid development of information technology (IT) has forced companies to integrate tightly with their supply chain partners, enabling efficient information sharing between supply chain members and improving supply chain efficiency, in order to make their supply chain more flexible and efficient. IT therefore plays a critical role in supply chains. How to achieve higher organizational performance through IT in a complex and uncertain supply chain environment has become an important issue. Even though many practitioners and scholars have taken multiple points of view to investigate the effects of IT infrastructure capability on firms’ performance, little research has explored cause-and-effect relationships from the perspective of supply chain capabilities. Based on a resource-based view of the firm, this study develops a research framework for investigating the mediating role of supply chain capabilities in the relationships between IT infrastructure flexibility, integration, and firms’ performance. Data for the study were collected from 270 companies in the Taiwanese electronics industry and the relationships proposed in the framework were tested using the Partial Least Squares method. The results indicate that IT infrastructure integration and flexibility indirectly and positively impact organizational performance through the mediating effect of supply chain capability, and the mediating effect is a full mediation. The findings provide empirical support to resourced-based IT studies, which propose mediating IT impacts on organizational performance. This study should be useful to practitioners who implement IT strategy. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Recognizing trust as the basis for firm cooperation, we investigate how a trust mechanism affects a supply chain network using a dynamic multi-agent and multi-stage model that incorporates three supplier selection rules: a preferred price rule, a preferred trust rule, and a preferred random rule. We use this model to explore the impact of the three rules on supply chain performance and bankruptcy propagation under the conditions of external disruption, bank rate, and new firms entering the market. Our results identify the preferred trust rule as the supplier selection method that can in most cases best improve the total revenue of the whole supply chain network. In terms of firm bankruptcy, on the other hand, it is the preferred random rule that has the least impact and the preferred price rule that has the most. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The electricity system reform has put forward new requirements on the traditional electricity trading mode and pricing mechanism. The deregulation of both sides of electricity generation and electricity sale and the control of transmission has become an important guide for the reform. In this paper, reference the centralized transaction mode of foreign electricity market, the idea of game theory and dynamic pricing method are used to introduce the competition mechanism into the electricity supply chain. The dynamic Stackelberg game model considering the strategic choice behavior of users is established under the centralized transaction mode. The time-sharing dynamic pricing scheme for maximizing the revenue of electricity producers is obtained. The effectiveness of the pricing strategy is verified by introducing the equilibrium validity factor through the example simulation. The results show that the introduction of competition in the electricity market can effectively reduce the electricity price of electricity producers and improve the electricity supply. At the same time, the dynamic pricing strategy has higher equilibrium effectiveness in the electricity market where the price demand elasticity of electricity users, the leader’s initial market share and the proportion of active users are all higher. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper extends existing research on the dynamic behaviour of supply chains by including the influence of online reviews. We model an online supply chain which contains customers and one e-commerce retailer. By using simulation, we compare the dynamic performance in a supply chain for two scenarios, namely adopting an online review system and without adopting the system. The supply chain dynamic performance is measured by bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification. The results demonstrate that the online review system increases both the bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification, and this impact can be moderated by product quality, unit mismatch cost, lead time, and customer volatility. We further explore how our model could be extended to include market competition, dual sourcing, online review manipulation, and product returns. As the increase in the bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification can be associated with supply chain inefficiency, managers who are aware of such consequences induced by online review adoption can make better decisions in supply chain management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide evidence on the impact of network flexibility and its ambidextrous influence on a firm's exploratory and exploitative partnership selection. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop our hypotheses based on the literature of network flexibility and draw on a sample of publicly listed firms in Taiwan semiconductor and optoelectronics industries. The authors collect our data from survey questionnaires and archival sources and examine our hypotheses by using the generalized linear model (GLM) approach. Findings: The authors’ empirical findings show that configuration flexibility has a greater influence on exploratory partnerships, while manufacturing flexibility has a greater impact on exploitative partnerships. In addition, when firms are ambidextrous (i.e. have both types of flexibility), they are able to simultaneously obtain both exploratory and exploitative partnerships. The authors’ findings indicate that balancing network flexibility is critical when firms execute ambidextrous alliance strategies. Research limitations/implications: The authors’ use of survey data to measure network flexibility may limit our observations related to network evolution. In addition, the authors’ use of public annual reports to capture firm partnerships may cause us to ignore informal relationships between partners. Practical implications: The authors’ empirical findings suggest that the types of partnerships firms develop depend on which types of flexibility they possess. The results further suggest that decision makers have to find a way to develop a balanced strategy between network configuration and manufacturing flexibility when they would like to develop an ambidextrous alliance strategy. Originality/value: The authors’ study advances the understanding in the literature on supply chain flexibility and its ambidexterity by connecting network flexibility and ambidextrous alliance strategy. The authors offer a guide to supply chain managers in the area of network design. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the dimensions of Triple-A SCs and their concurrent impact on all three Triple-A components. Design/methodology/approach: The relationship among these factors is analyzed through Smart PLS-structured equation modeling (PLS-SEM) for which data have been collected from 243 SC professionals working in manufacturing organizations. Findings: The findings of this study reveal that the relationship between visibility and adaptability are directly significant but that the negative relationship between velocity and alignment is insignificant; however, indirectly these relationships have a positive impact using the mediating effect of agility over visibility and adaptability, velocity and alignment. However, the relationship of flexibility over SC Triple-A is positively significant, visibility over agility and alignment is positively significant and velocity over agility and adaptability is also positively significant, and each impact agility over adaptability and adaptability over alignment which is significant. Originality/value: There is a shortage of empirical studies to date that empirically provide evidence of possible relationships among Triple-A and its key dimensions when attempting to obtain Triple-A. This is the first authenticated Triple-A SC conceptual framework that provides direction to better understand the dimension and significance of Triple-A. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Due to the increasing uncertainty and diversity in supply chains (SCs), companies are aiming to develop their SC flexibility, which we define as the capability of a company, both internally and externally in conjunction with its key suppliers and customers, to respond to uncertainties and customer expectations without excessive costs, time and performance losses. SC flexibility has three dimensions–internal, supplier and customer flexibility. This study investigates how SC flexibility improves operational and financial performance from the organisational capability perspective. The conceptual model is empirically tested using data collected from 216 companies in China. Our findings suggest that only customer and internal flexibility contribute to operational performance directly, while supplier flexibility contributes to operational performance only indirectly through internal flexibility. The three dimensions of SC flexibility have no direct impacts on financial performance. We further identify complementarities between supplier and customer flexibility and tradeoffs between supplier and internal flexibility. However, no synergy effect is found for internal and customer flexibility on operational performance. This study provides a framework to understand SC flexibility from the organisational capability perspective and identifies the inter-relationships among the three dimensions of SC flexibility and operational and financial performance. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Supply chains (SC) are increasingly complex and if the resulting complexity is not managed effectively, it could lead to adverse consequences for the firm. The effect big data analytics (BDA) can have on managing distinct types of SC complexity is not well-understood in the extant literature. Based on a sample of 166 firms from Pakistan, this study empirically investigates the effects of BDA, and structural and dynamic SC complexities, on SC resilience. The study also investigates the role of BDA as a mediator between SC complexities and SC resilience. We find that structural SC complexity positively affects SC resilience, while there doesn’t seem to be a significant impact for dynamic SC complexity. We also find a mediating effect of BDA for structural and dynamic SC complexities on SC resilience. Our results contribute to the extant literature investigating BDA and SC resilience by offering a more nuanced understanding of distinct types of SC complexities. We establish a more critical understanding of the role of BDA in mediating the critical link between the two types of SC complexity and SC resilience. The proposed model highlights that there are both direct and indirect effects between structural SC complexity and SC resilience, however dynamic SC complexity only influences SC resilience via BDA. These findings provide strategic insights for SC executives as to where to invest in BDA to build much-needed SC resilience. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify which innovation implementation strategies have the highest success potential, and which factors affect the adoption of fruit-related innovations by consumers. The authors focus on consumer-driven and responsive fruit supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose a new conceptual framework that links fruit consumption to innovation implementation strategies. A total of 36 experts in four panels organised, respectively, in Spain, Poland, Greece, and The Netherlands evaluated the elements of the proposed framework. Findings: "Market orientation" and "continuous learning and knowledge acquisition" surfaced as the innovation implementation strategies with the highest success potential. However, the optimal mix of strategies depends on the particular innovation as well as the geographic and cultural characteristics of the targeted consumer population. Furthermore, improving technological competence is the single most important factor affecting fruit innovation adoption. Research limitations/implications: The reported results are derived from four small groups of purposefully chosen experts and supply chain stakeholders. Nevertheless, they provide new insights useful to policy makers, consumers, and entrepreneurs. Practical implications: In designing innovations, fruit chain actors should first and foremost consider the price premium consumers will have to pay. Furthermore, for some innovations geographic or cultural characteristics become very important. Therefore, fruit supply chains should design their innovation implementation strategies accordingly. Social implications: By adopting efficiently designed innovation implementation strategies, consumer-driven fruit supply chains will convince consumers to eat more fruit. Thus, given the critical contribution of fruit consumption to human health, an important social goal is achieved. Originality/value: While the literature on innovation is enormous, very little has been published on innovation implementation strategies adopted by consumer-driven and responsive fruit chains. The significance of addressing the previously mentioned issues stems from the need to increase fruit consumption in Europe, which lags behind the levels suggested by physicians and nutrition scientists. Fruit-related innovations are a useful means to achieving this goal. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Batik is an Indonesian cultural asset that should be preserved. In the perspective of its protection, supply chain performance is important to be assessed, especially on its industrial aspect. Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) is a method of self-assessment and a comparison of activities in the supply chain performance evaluation using five attributes; reliability, responsiveness, costs, assets management, and agility. Measurements with SCOR method presents a framework of business processes, performance indicators, best practices, as well as a unique technology to support communication and collaboration inter-supply chain, so as to improve the effectiveness of supply chain management and the effectiveness of supply chain improvement. SCOR focused on causality of the steps that are shaped linear correlation. This state of condition appears to be the weakness of SCOR method, because it cannot continue more specific steps forward that can predict performance. In this study, SCOR in combination with System Dynamics (SD) can identify the four perspectives and their interaction variables associated with causal loop design model. The design of a hybrid model SCOR-SD provides more effective and interesting value. Furthermore, the simulation of the model from data inputs in 2014 creates prediction until 2019. The results obtained for the reliability attributes associated with perfect order fulfillment started in 2015 to 2019 respectively 85.16% to 91.06%. Responsiveness attributes associated with the order fulfillment cycle time started at 69.71 days to 62.04 days. The simulation results show that the associated total cost was fluctuated ranging from IDR 1,491,041.700 to IDR 1,470,531,891. Attributes associated with cash management assets to cash cycle time in a row is 35 days to 26 days.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the underlying mechanism through which firms can achieve supply chain agility and augment business performance from the vendor’s perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on dynamic capability view and contingency theory, the study conceptualizes a moderated mediation model to investigate the underlying influence of process integration (PI), supply flexibility and product-related complexity on supply chain agility and the subsequent effect of supply chain agility on firm’s business performance. Survey data from a sample of 148 firms, in the garment manufacturing industry, in Pakistan were analyzed using partial least square methods. Findings: The results revealed that supply flexibility (i.e. volume and mix) mediates the effect of PI on supply chain agility. Supply chain agility, in turn, influences a firm’s business performance. Furthermore, the competence‒capability framework is not consistent across the varying degrees of product complexity such as product complexity hinders the effect of supply flexibility on supply chain agility, whereas it amplifies the impact of PI on supply chain agility. The conditional indirect effects suggest that the indirect effect of PI on supply chain agility through supply flexibility becomes stronger when product complexity is high. Originality/value: The study is novel in the context of an emerging economy to educate fashion vendors to tune their competencies and capabilities to regain the market share in the global market place. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To respond to these challenges, automotive supply chain incorporates flexibility in the order-fulfillment process through vehicle trades. This study focuses on a new category of vehicle trades where dealers trade vehicles that are still under production (order-trades) and in the delivery phase of the order-fulfillment process (distribution-trades). Using empirical data in an experimental design setting, order- and distribution-trades are shown to improve flexibility in order fulfillment, with no additional costs for the manufacturer. Different managerial levers such as trade fees and trade caps are evaluated to develop insights for managing vehicle trades. The results show that the involvement of the manufacturer in planning order- and distribution-trades helps in lowering inventory, reducing lost sales, and improving logistics costs for the entire supply chain. © 2018 Decision Sciences Institute},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to develop a comprehensive model that facilitates an understanding of relationships among information and communication technology, integrative capabilities, operational responsiveness and dimensions of performance in a developing economy. Data were collected from a survey administered to 140 firms in the manufacturing industry in Pakistan. Hypotheses testing were done by PLS-SEM using SMART-PLS software. The results show that the best way to achieve operational performance is to better invest in information and communication technology which improves the integrative capabilities along with operational responsiveness, which in turn improves the operational performance. This paper provides insights to many supply chain practitioners to configure their supply chain responsiveness from customer facing to supplier facing through integration. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of this research is to better understand the impact of supply chain management (SCM) and flexibility on firm performance, as well as the role of competitive advantage in mediating the model in Indonesian agriculture companies. Companies must apply supply chain management and supply chain flexibility (SCF) to boost industrial competitiveness, which impacts firm performance. To ensure that supply chain management supports the company's strategy, companies must evaluate supply chain concerns. From the literature search, researchers have not found any published studies or articles on SCM and SCF in their influence on firm performance through competitive advantage, specifically for corn companies in Indonesia. The population in this study includes agriculture companies in Indonesia. Sampling was carried out using probability sampling technique, the total population of 200 obtained a sample size of 133.333 which can be rounded up to 134 research samples. The inferential statistical method used in the data analysis of this study was the Partial Least Square Version 3 program. The study found that SCM influenced firm performance and SCF had a direct influence on firm performance. However, competitive advantage variable failed in being a mediator in SCM and SCF on firm performance. © 2022 by the authors;.},

In the generalised model, we formalize supply chain multi-structural dynamics and dynamic service composition. Our results show that the main generalized characteristics of the cloud supply chain are related to (i) multi-structural dynamics; (ii) platforms, digital supply chains, ecosystems, and visibility, (iii) dynamic service composition with dynamically changing buyer/supplier roles, (iv) resilience and viability, and (v) intertwined supply networks and circular economy.

abstract={Entering the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on supply chains. Reacting to the pandemic and adaptation in the “new normal” have been challenging tasks. Exiting the pandemic can lead to some after-shock effects such as “disruption tails.” While the research community has undertaken considerable efforts to predict the pandemic’s impacts and examine supply chain adaptive behaviors during the pandemic, little is known about supply chain management in the course of pandemic elimination and post-disruption recovery. If capacity and inventory management are unaware of the after-shock risks, this can result in highly destabilized production–inventory dynamics and decreased performance in the post-disruption period causing product deficits in the markets and high inventory costs in the supply chains. In this paper, we use a discrete-event simulation model to investigate some exit strategies for a supply chain in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model can inform managers about the existence and risk of disruption tails in their supply chains and guide the selection of post-pandemic recovery strategies. Our results show that supply chains with postponed demand and shutdown capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic are particularly prone to disruption tails. We then developed and examined two strategies to avoid these disruption tails. First, we observed a conjunction of recovery and supply chain coordination which mitigates the impact of disruption tails by demand smoothing over time in the post-disruption period. Second, we found a gradual capacity ramp-up prior to expected peaks of postponed demand to be an effective strategy for disruption tail control. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: Supply chain resilience capabilities are usually considered in light of some anticipated events and are as passive assets, which are “waiting” for use in case of an emergency. This, however, can be inefficient. Moreover, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed difficulties in the timely deployments of resilience assets and their utilization for value creation. We present a framework that consolidates different angles of efficient resilience and renders utilization of resilience capabilities for creation of value. Design/methodology/approach: We conceptualise the design of the AURA (Active Usage of Resilience Assets) framework for post-COVID-19 supply chain management through collating the extant literature on value creation-oriented resilience and practical examples and complementing our analysis with a discussion of practical implementations. Findings: Building upon and integrating the existing frameworks of VSC (Viable Supply Chain), RSC (Reconfigurable Supply Chain) and LCNSC (Low-Certainty-Need Supply Chain), we elaborate on a new idea in the AURA approach – to consider resilience as an inherent, active and value-creating component of operations management decisions, rather than as a passive “shield” to protect against rare, severe events. We identify 10 future research areas for lean resilience integrating management and digital platforms and technology. Practical implications: The outcomes of our study can be used by supply chain and operations managers to improve the efficiency and effectiveness by turning resilience from passive, cost-driving assets into a value-creating, inclusive decision-making paradigm. Originality/value: We propose a novel approach to bring more dynamics to the notion of supply chain resilience. We name our approach AURA and articulate its two major advantages as follows: (1) reduction of disruption prediction efforts and (2) value creation from resilience assets. We offer a discussion on ten future research directions towards a lean resilience. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Sourcing strategy analysis in the settings of supply chain (SC) flexibility in regard to single vs. dual sourcing has been a well-explored area over the last two decades. In recent years, single vs. dual sourcing analysis has been increasingly introduced in SC disruption management. Since most of the decision-support models for SC sourcing strategy adaptation in the case of disruptions presume real-time information and coordination, the issues of big data and business intelligence needs to be included into the consideration. A SC simulation model with consideration of capacity disruption and big data along with experimental results are presented. Based on both literature analysis and modelling example, managerial insights are derived. A set of sensitivity experiments allows us to illustrate the model's behaviour. The analysis suggests recommendation on using single sourcing, capacity flexibility and dual sourcing for different combinations of demand and inventory patterns. The paper is concluded by summarising the most important insights and outlining future research agenda. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, we develop an adaptation-based supply chain resilience framework based on the control theoretic perspective for supply chain planning domain regarding the agility and disruption-resistance to achieve maximal economic performance and stability in supply chains. We propose a detailed analysis of supply chain resilience based on a mutual classification of flexibility and reliability elements. Subsequently, an algorithm of decision-making on supply chain planning regarding ensuring both supply chain reliability and flexibility is presented. The quantitative approaches and formal tools are based on the modern control theory in combination with operations research techniques, global stability, controlled adaptation and the use of attainable sets. The developed framework and tools which are supporting it allow us to find this balance with regard to supply chain protection and adaptability. Moreover, it makes it possible to take into account individual risk perceptions of managers, different strategies with regard to risk management, and to consider not only supply chain economic performance but also supply chain stability, which is becoming more and more important in ongoing economic transformation. The developed framework contributes both to the methodical part of SCM and to its practical part where the developed methodical guidelines can be localized for concrete application issues. The framework allows us to approach the issues of mitigating uncertainty and increasing resilience of supply chains from the control theoretic perspective. From the practice point of view, the gained insights provide decision-makers with the possibility to balance reliability and flexibility to achieve maximal economic performance and resilience in supply chains. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={Supply chain disruption management aims at real-time supply chain monitoring, alerting supply chain participants about deviations and possible disruptions as well as elaborating adjustment control actions. A basis for the alerting and disruption recovery is a tolerance area of execution parameters' admissible deviations. Two important questions still remain open: (i) how to determine the borders of the tolerance area and (ii) what adjustments steps should be taken to overcome a disruption. In this paper, we propose to use dynamic robustness analysis on the basis of attainable sets and the adaptive adjustment on the basis of positional optimization as an integrated framework to extend existing techniques. We consider supply chain robustness as a dynamic supply chain property that emerges through controlled adaptability on the basis of feedback loops. With the results of this study, the borders of deviations' sectors within the tolerance area can be determined. In each of these sectors, certain adjustment actions at different adaptation levels can be interrelated. Copyright © 2013 IFAC. © IFAC.},

abstract={Based on a combination of fundamental results of modern optimal program control theory and operations research, an original approach to supply chain scheduling is developed in order to answer the challenges of dynamics, uncertainty, and adaptivity. Both supply chain schedule generation and execution control are represented as an optimal program control problem in combination with mathematical programming and interpreted as a dynamic process of operations control within an adaptive framework. Hence, the problems and models of planning, scheduling, and adaptation can be consistently integrated on a unified mathematical axiomatic of modern control theory. In addition, operations control and flow control models are integrated and applicable for both discrete and continuous processes. The application of optimal control for supply chain scheduling becomes possible by formulating the scheduling model as a linear non-stationary finite-dimensional controlled differential system with the convex area of admissible control and a reconfigurable structure. For this model class, theorems of optimal control existence can be used regarding supply chain scheduling. The essential structural property of this model are the linear right parts of differential equations. This allows applying methods of discrete optimization for optimal control calculation. The calculation procedure is based on applying Pontryagin's maximum principle and the resulting essential reduction of problem dimensionality that is under solution at each instant of time. The gained insights contribute to supply chain scheduling theory, providing advanced insights into dynamics of the whole supply chains (and not any dyadic relations in them) and transition from a partial "one-way" schedule optimization to the feedback loop-based dynamic and adaptive supply chain planning and scheduling. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

abstract={Decisions in supply chain planning and control are interconnected and depend on tackling uncertainties and dynamics. From this perspective, control theory (CT) is an interesting research avenue for the supply chain management (SCM). In this paper, the applicability of optimal CT to SCM is investigated. Our analysis is based on the fundamentals of control and systems theory and experimental modeling. The paper describes important issues and perspectives that delineate dynamics in supply chains, identifies and systemizes different streams in application of CT to production, logistics, and SCM in the period from 1960 to 2011. It derives some classifications, performs a critical analysis, and discusses further researches. Some drawbacks and missing links in the literature are pointed out. Several crucial application areas of control theory to SCM are discussed. Subsequently, optimal program control, challenges and advantages of its application in the SCM are addressed. It is shown how optimal program control can be applied to adaptive supply chain planning. In addition, it is concluded that with the help of CT, robustness, adaptability, and resilience of supply chains can be investigated in their consistency with operations planning and execution control within a conceptually and mathematically integrated framework. However, although SCs resemble control systems, they have some peculiarities which do not allow a direct application of CT methods. In this setting, further development of interdisciplinary approaches to supply chain optimization is argued. An extended co-operation between control and supply chain experts may have the potential to introduce more realism to the dynamic planning and models and improve real-time supply chain control policies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this chapter, the supply chain management perspective of sustainable management is addressed. Based on the literature analysis, we develop a qualitative adaptive framework for sustainable supply networks that is composed of the integrated elements of environment management, operations economic development and information technologies, productlife-cycle management, and social development. Subsequently, we develop a quantitative adaptive framework for sustainable supply networks. As sustainable systems are designed to support decisions on planning, analysis and improving organization's actions and operations to meet competitiveness and sustainability goals, it becomes necessary to interconnectthe stages of supply network planning and execution. Indeed, as supply networks are not static but highly dynamic and permanently evolving systems, sustainability of these networks should also be considered as a dynamic category of supply chain (SC) adaptive evolution. Mathematical framework is based on a combined application of operations research and modern control theory. Finally, we address the issue of interrelating environment and economic sustainability and propose to consider the SC property to achieve a balance between the economic output performance and resource consumption as the SC global stability. The proposed framework can be employed as a competitive strategy to increase organizations' wealth and sustainability by producing demand-corresponding products in a cost-effective manner through an increase of SC agility, resilience, stability, and adaptation capabilities. © 2012 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

abstract={Greening of supply chain operations is best to be addressed at the network design phase where strategic facility location, technology and transport mode decisionsare made. This has been an important area of research focus for almost a decade now. Given the increasing frequency and intensity of disruptive events facing today’s organizations, the greening analyses of supply chains need totake into consideration how the economic and environmental performance of the supply chain can be affected in the face of unanticipated disruptions. Thus, static greeninganalysis is simplistic and achieving a truly green supply chain requires a dynamic analysis to develop robustsupplychains whose sustainability performance remains unaffected or only lightly affected by disruptions of various types. This chapter presents a framework and optimization model for dynamic sustainability analysis. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the application of the approach in performing tradeoff analysis in business-as-usualand disruption circumstances. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={This study considers supply chain network configuration in an innovative environment while the new product development (NPD) will affect the supply chain configuration (SCC). The time of new product introduction has a significant effect on the market performance while it has an effect on the supply chain configuration. Supplier integration into the new product introduction is the key parameter for successfully new product introduction, which may contribute to supply chain reconfiguration. Consequently By considering the new product development concept, we may face with dynamic supply chain configuration during a planning horizontal time. In this study, a new model is presented to consider the dynamic configuration of a supply chain by developing new products. In the proposed model, the dynamic configuration of a supply chain and the new product launching time is optimized simultaneously. The proposed model considers production, sales and transportation planning for the entire supply chain in order to achieve an integrative and efficient supply as well. Then some numerical analyses have been done to show the applicability of the proposed model. The results show that the new product development has a significant effect on the configuration of supply chain. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The purpose of this study is to investigate and find the key factors affecting the resilience of the supply chain of medical equipment and to examine the dynamic relations among these factors. Design/methodology/approach: A hybrid methodology is used for meeting the purpose of this study. First, the Delphi method is extended by using hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets to identify the key factors of supply chain resilience. At the second phase, using the system dynamic methodology, the dynamic relations among identified resilience factors are analyzed. Findings: Using the Delphi method, agility, collaboration among actors, sharing of information, trust among actors, explicitness of supply chain, risk management culture, adaptability, structure, funding and environment conditions are identified as ten major factors affecting medical equipment’s supply chain resilience. Also, four scenarios are simulated along with their impacts on the system. Originality/value: The main contribution of this study is extending a hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets-based Delphi and applying it along a system dynamic analysis to identify the key factors affecting resilience of medical equipment’s supply chain for the first time. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Determining the supply chain length help companies to know how fast its products move from manufacturer to distributor, from distributor to retail outlets and from retail outlets to end-customer. Based on the literature review carried-out, it was found that many researchers have studied the supply chain performance using metrics at supply stage, manufacturing stage and distribution stage. Length of the supply chain of products is one of the important metrics to evaluate the supply chain performance. When it comes to perishable products, length of supply chain measured in terms of time indicates how fast the product moves and reaches the costumer hands from the time of manufacturing. No study has been attempted so far to measure the supply chain using time duration for perishable products. This paper focuses on measuring the supply chain length of products manufactured in one of the leading milk products manufacturing company located in Erode, an emerging city in south India. The sampling frame comprises the retailers those deals with dairy products in Erode district. A random sampling method is used by selecting 64 retailers. Retailers located in seven small cities in Erode district were considered for the study. Retailers taken for the study include those sell dairy and related products. 168 complete filled-in forms were collected directly in person from the owners of retailers. Five fast moving products were selected for the study that includes Panner, Lassi, Cheese, Curd and Ghee. Primary data were collected using a questionnaire. The length of the supply chain was arrived using the methodology based on time factors at the manufacturing stage, retailer stage and customer stage. Data on primary variables viz. Stock level, sales quantity, and date of manufacture were collected to determine the supply chain length. Test results on comparing the time taken for products across various locations, it was proved that there is a significant difference in the time taken to reach the customers between products at various locations. Supply chain performance is classified into the Rapid Responsive Supply Chain (RRSC) and Slow Responsive Supply Chain (SRSC) comparing the time difference between the estimated supply chain length and actual supply chain length of products. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

abstract={In order to enhance customer's loyalty in a supply chain, many efforts could be done such as upgrading the service facilities and decreasing delivery time. Although these efforts need to extra-added cost, but we can reduce the shortage cost in supply chain. In this paper we consider a five-tier supply chain and assume that the lead time of manufacturers and warehouses can be shortened at an extra crashing cost, which depends on the length of lead time. Also we consider different options with different prices for product transportation between facilities. We formulate mixed integer non-linear model for a five-tiers supply chain with controllable lead time and multiple transportation options and develop a novel meta-heuristic method that combines the Taguchi's feature with Artificial Immune System (AIS) to solve the proposed model. The performance of the proposed solution method has been examined against a set of numeric instances and the obtained results are compared with those provided by AIS and the hybrid of Taguchi-genetic algorithm (GATA). Results indicate that the proposed method can provide better results than the previous solutions effectively. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the last decade, the development of such phenomena as outsourcing, offshoring, disruption of the production chain or innovative regional clusters can be observed. Several phenomena that shape the global economy have a direct or indirect impact on supply chains and the location of production plants around the world. Currently, undoubtedly a phenomenon that has changed the world's strongest trends was the pandemic Covid - 19. The impact of the pandemic is multidimensional and visible in virtually every area of economic, social and even cultural life. There are also phenomena observed in recent years related to the New Industrial Revolution, protectionist policies pursued more and more often, as well as activities aimed at sustainable development and care for the environment. The article aims to present the possibility of including local clusters in global production chains as a consequence of technological changes as part of the New Industry Revolution, national policies and sustainability policy as well as the economic slowdown related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Currently, global value chains are shortening and production is more geographically concentrated. Reconfiguration of supply chains and directing them to the local direction can contribute to the development of local clusters, which are a combination of companies often constituting a comprehensive production chain located in one place. © University of Latvia, 2002-2021.},

abstract={In this study, a mathematical inventory model for a supply chain system made up of a vendor and a buyer under stochastic demand is formulated. The vendor serves as a manufacturer who produces items, while the buyer serves as a retailer who buys the items from the vendor and sells them to end customers. In addition to utilizing regular production as a production base, the vendor also uses green production. Green production adopts green technology, which comprises environmentally friendly inventions that are used to reduce emissions. Green production is more costly than regular production, but it generates lower emissions. The production rate is adjustable, which enables decision makers to control the emissions and production cost. The objective of this study is to find the optimal production allocation, ordering quantity, shipment frequency, safety factor, and production rate such that the joint total cost is minimized. An algorithm is suggested to solve the mathematical problems and its application is validated with a numerical example. The results show that the changes in the emissions, carbon tax, and production cost parameters exhibit significant effects in determining the optimal production allocation. Furthermore, by controlling the production rate flexibly, the supply chain can lessen the emissions released during production and maintain the total cost. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to explain the usage of the proposed model. © 2022},

abstract={Due to the consistent growth of energy consumption and its impacts on production costs and the environment, governments have recently begun to devise and implement various energy-saving (ES) strategies. This paper studies the optimal pricing decisions in a dual-channel supply chain (SC) —consists of a manufacturer and a retailer— under different government intervention policies, namely ES, revenue seeking, social welfare, and sustainable development. We develop an extended dual-channel SC model under flexible return policies, including full-refund via the direct (i.e., manufacturer) channel, the indirect (i.e., retailer) channel, and both direct and indirect channels. A dynamic multi-level Stackelberg game approach is used to examine the SC interactions and characterize the return strategy, optimal pricing, and ES level decisions under different scenarios. The results show that employing full-refund via the indirect channel policy under price incentive schemes not only maximizes the profit of dual-channel SC but also satisfies the government's objective functions. In contrast to other intervention policies, the revenue seeking policy does not necessarily improve the social welfare and energy saving level unless the government budget is increased. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Sustainability has become a critical issue for both society and businesses globally. With the increase of natural disasters and global issues such as water shortages, acid rain and climate change companies have started focusing on reducing their carbon footprint to ensure that the world’s natural resources are sustained for the foreseeable future. Many international and local companies are now looking to incorporate green initiatives into their supply chain management. This has given rise to green supply chain management which is the incorporation of sustainable initiatives into the supply chain of a company. Designing green supply chains (GSCs) requires complex decision support models that can deal with multiple dimensions of sustainability and specific characteristics of products and supply chain. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches can be used to quantify trade-offs between economic, social, and environmental criteria i.e. to identify green production options. This study presents a hybrid decision-making approach for group multi-criteria evaluation for green supply chain management (GSCM) implementation criteria, which clubs many green processes with order allocation for dynamic supply chains to cope market variations. More specifically, the developed approach imitates the knowledge acquisition and manipulation in a manner like the decision makers who have gathered considerable knowledge and expertise in this domain. Fuzzy DEMATEL is first applied to find the causal relationship between the criteria and to rank them. Fuzzy SWARA method is used for evaluation of GSCM implementation criteria weights, which are qualitatively meaningful. Thereafter, using fuzzy TOPSIS method, the criteria application is quantitatively evaluated again for order allocation of criteria. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed hybrid framework, a real-life case study is presented in the chapter, and the results are analysed accordingly. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Motivated by the recovery of modular-structured products, this study addresses the flexible design of a reverse supply chain (RSC) over a planning horizon while incorporating the dynamic uncertain behavior of product returns. The stochastic parameter is modeled as a scenario tree and therefore the concerned problem is formulated as a multistage mixed-integer stochastic program. To alleviate the computational complexity of the proposed model, it is decomposed into smaller scenario cluster submodels associated with a number of subtrees that share a certain number of predecessor nodes in the original scenario tree. The submodels are coordinated into an implementable solution via a Lagrangian-progressive hedging-based method that employs a viable Benders decomposition based algorithm for solving each scenario cluster submodel. Based on a realistic scale case, computational results indicate the superiority of the proposed flexible dynamic RSC design model compared to the existing models. Results also demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solution approach. © 2020 The Authors.

In this research, the supply flexibility has been investigated through the lens of RBV, and in this regard, contributions have been made to the existing literature on flexibility in supply chains. By recognising the role of resources in the flexibility of supply, the supply flexibility concept has been developed. The two distinct dimensions of supply flexibility were investigated: supply network flexibility and supplier flexibility. The complications in the network of the supplier can be explored with the instruments developed for supply flexibility. This can provide a great understanding of the contribution of supply flexibility in achieving competitive advantage. It is interesting to know whether the improvements in supply flexibility create an influence on product development and manufacturing flexibility. The SEM-PLS is used to analyse the data. The findings of the study have provided support to the hypothesised results. DKSH Thailand is taken as a final sample of the study. The results of the study have shown the relationship between supply flexibility, SC management and SC performance. It has been found that the current performance of the companies can be improved in the uncertain and dynamic business environment by linking the capabilities of supply network flexibility and practices of SC management.

abstract={Under the increasing pressure of global emission reduction, prefabricated buildings are becoming more and more popular. As prefabricated building manufacturers and assemblers are emerging in the market, how do they make decisions of pricing, ordering, and emission reduction? In this paper, game theory is used to make the decisions for the prefabricated building supply chain with flexible cap-and-trade and different power structures, i.e., using prefabricated building manufacturers as the leader, using the vertical Nash equilibrium, and using prefabricated building assemblers as the leader. The two-part tariff contract is designed to coordinate the supply chain and to improve the supply chain performance. Moreover, we discuss the influence of different power structures and the two-part tariff contract on the optimal decisions and profits. Finally, numerical analysis is used to verify the conclusions. This indicates that the supply chain leaders will gain a higher profit and that the power structure has a significant influence on the two-part tariff contract, which will result in an unfair distribution of profit. High carbon trading prices benefit carbon emission reduction. Consumer low-carbon awareness has a positive effect on carbon emission reduction and supply chain performance. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={As the market demand becomes more diversified and dynamic, the requirements for manufacturing systems feature a high degree of flexibility, low cost, low volume, and short delivery times. One emerging way for such flexible manufacturing is so-called "factory-in-A-box," by which production modules are installed in a container and transported by a vehicle. The factory-in-A-box manufacturing poses a unique challenge to manufacturing supply chain network since the ease of supply chain reconfiguration when the vehicle moves to a different production site has become a major concern in addition to transportation cost and delivery time. The supply chain design is further complicated by the fact that it is coupled with subassembly planning in manufacturing, which determines appropriate subassembly modules assigned to suppliers. As such, it is critical to understand the interaction between supply chain network reconfigurability and subassembly planning. This paper develops a model using a set of decision variables to jointly characterize the topology of supply chain network and subassembly planning. A binary nonlinear programming model has been developed for the concurrent optimization of subassembly planning and supply chain network with the consideration of reconfiguration of the supply chain structure. One numerical case study was conducted to demonstrate the proposed model by providing a quantitative guideline of reconfiguring supply chain network when the final production site (on a vehicle) changes locations.

abstract={Purpose: The stable relationship of one-supplier-one-customer is replaced by a dynamic relationship of multi-supplier-multi-customer in current market gradually, and efficient scheduling techniques are important tools of the dynamic supply chain relationship establishing process. This paper studies the optimization of the integrated planning and scheduling problem of a two-stage supply chain with multiple manufacturers and multiple retailers to obtain a minimum supply chain operating cost, whose manufacturers have different production capacities, holding and producing cost rates, transportation costs to retailers. Design/methodology/approach: As a complex task allocation and scheduling problem, this paper sets up an INLP model for it and designs a Unit Cost Adjusting (UCA) heuristic algorithm that adjust the suppliers’ supplying quantity according to their unit costs step by step to solve the model. Findings: Relying on the contrasting analysis between the UCA and the Lingo solvers for optimizing many numerical experiments, results show that the INLP model and the UCA algorithm can obtain its near optimal solution of the two-stage supply chain’s planning and scheduling problem within very short CPU time. Research limitations/implications: The proposed UCA heuristic can easily help managers to optimizing the two-stage supply chain scheduling problems which doesn’t include the delivery time and batch of orders. For two-stage supply chains are the most common form of actual commercial relationships, so to make some modification and study on the UCA heuristic should be able to optimize the integrated planning and scheduling problems of a supply chain with more reality constraints. Originality/value: This research proposes an innovative UCA heuristic for optimizing the integrated planning and scheduling problem of two-stage supply chains with the constraints of suppliers’ production capacity and the orders’ delivering time, and has a great practical significance to the dynamic relationship establishment of multi-supplier-multi-customer in current market. © 2014 Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

abstract={The red meat value chain in Australia is undergoing a rapid change due to globalisation, a highly competitive meat market and increased production efficiency and flexibility. This paper aims to investigate how beef producers can increase supply chain performance (SCP) flexibility by improving supply chain practices. A model was developed and hypotheses were formulated based on the literature review of agri-food supply chains. A survey questionnaire was distributed to beef producers in Australia and the results of stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that performance flexibility was significantly influenced by the supply chain practices: customer relationships and information quality (IQ). Given these findings, beef producers should focus on customer relationships and IQ in order to achieve enhanced flexibility in their SCP. The paper discusses the implications and current practices in beef cattle farming industry. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In this paper we consider a non-cooperative N players differential game affected by deterministic uncertainties. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a robust feedback Nash equilibrium are presented in a set of min-max forms of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Such conditions are then used to find the robust Nash controls for a linear affine quadratic game affected by a square integrable uncertainty, which is seen as a malicious fictitious player trying to maximize the cost function of each player. The approach allows us to find robust strategies in the solution of a group of coupled Riccati differential equation. The finite, as well as infinite, time horizon cases are solved for this last game. As an illustration of the approach, the problem of the coordination of a two-echelon supply chain with seasonal uncertain fluctuations in demand is developed. © 2020 Vilnius University.},

abstract={This research explores the mechanism through which IT infrastructure enables superior firm performance by empirically examining the links among IT-enabled sharing capability, supply chain flexibilities (as measured by a manufacturing firms product development flexibility, production flexibility, logistics flexibility, suppliers flexibility, and the flexibility of the supply base), and competitive performance. This study expands the research on ITs impact on competitive performance by focusing on IT-enabled sharing capability and the indirect effect of this capability on firm performance. Most prior research focused on the technical aspects of IT infrastructure and tested direct relationships. In this research, a large-scale survey was used to collect 198 responses from U.S. manufacturers to investigate this framework. Structural Equation Modeling was used to examine and test the measurement and structural models. The results indicated that IT-enabled sharing capability is associated with flexibilities in a manufacturers supply chain, which in turn are associated with the firms competitive performance. This finding suggests that a firm should focus on flexibilities in the supply chain to improve its performance. IT-enabled sharing capability is an antecedent for improving these flexibilities. Longitudinal research, multiple respondents, and techniques for improving response rate should be considered in future research to provide more robust results. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to explore relationships between two dimensional components of agility i.e. flexibility and responsiveness in humanitarian response operations with special reference to water based disasters such as cyclones and floods. Empirical data from four case-studies on cyclones and floods were collected to study and analyze humanitarian response operations. This includes data from 142 interviews, participant observation and documents obtained during field visits. The analysis revealed that supply chain visibility had a positive influence on both reactivity and volume flexibility. However, in-station last mile logistical capabilities mediated the relationship between reactivity and velocity of the supply chain. Delivery flexibility was observed to be dependent on reactivity. The results suggest that humanitarian organizations should focus on enhancing last mile delivery capabilities, communication and infrastructural resilience, and improve training of field forces for disaster-specific operations. Community involvement was observed to have a positive effect on response operations. This paper is the first to study agility of response operations for water based disasters. The insights will be useful for practitioners and researchers to build models that are more realistic. The theoretical contribution is the development of model capturing relationships between flexibility and responsiveness dimensions of supply chain agility. © 2021 Operations and Supply Chain Management Forum.

abstract={With the constantly increasing pressure of the competitive environment, supply chain (SC) decision makers are forced to consider several aspects of business climate. More specifically, they should take into account the endogenous features (e.g., available means of transportation, and the variety of products) and exogenous criteria (e.g., the environmental uncertainty, and transportation system conditions). In this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for dynamic design of a supply chain network is proposed. In this model, multiple products and multiple transportation modes, the time value of money, traffic congestion, and both supply-side and demand-side uncertainties are considered. Due to the complexity of such models, conventional solution methods are not applicable; therefore, two hybrid Electromagnetism-Like Algorithms (EMA) are designed and discussed for tackling the problem. The numerical results show the applicability of the proposed model and the capabilities of the solution approaches to the MINLP problem. Copyright © 2016 Javid Jouzdani and Mohammad Fathian.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel network and dynamic data envelopment analysis (DEA) model for evaluating sustainability of supply chains. In the proposed model, all links can be considered in calculation of efficiency score. Design/methodology/approach – A dynamic DEA model to evaluate sustainable supply chains in which networks have series structure is proposed. Nature of free links is defined and subsequently applied in calculating relative efficiency of supply chains. An additive network DEA model is developed to evaluate sustainability of supply chains in several periods. A case study demonstrates applicability of proposed approach. Findings – This paper assists managers to identify inefficient supply chains and take proper remedial actions for performance optimization. Besides, overall efficiency scores of supply chains have less fluctuation. By utilizing the proposed model and determining dual-role factors, managers can plan their supply chains properly and more accurately. Research limitations/implications – In real world, managers face with big data. Therefore, we need to develop an approach to deal with big data. Practical implications – The proposed model offers useful managerial implications along with means for managers to monitor and measure efficiency of their production processes. The proposed model can be applied in real world problems in which decision makers are faced with multi-stage processes such as supply chains, production systems, etc. Originality/value – For the first time, the authors present additive model of network-dynamic DEA. For the first time, the authors outline the links in a way that carry-overs of networks are connected in different periods and not in different stages. © Vahid Shokri Kahi, Saeed Yousefi, Hadi Shabanpour and Reza Farzipoor Saen.

Simulation experiments are conducted to match the results with literature and real-world scenario. It shows how spoilage information can be incorporated in the ordering decision to create highly responsive supply chain, which may not always be desirable. Amplification is lesser and stabilization is faster for supply chains of perishable items.

abstract={With the recent advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is now possible to process a large number of sensor data streams using different large-scale IoT platforms. These IoT frameworks are used to collect, process and analyse data streams in real-time and facilitate provision of smart solutions designed to provide decision support. Existing IoT-based solutions are mainly domain-dependent, providing stream processing and analytics focusing on specific areas (smart cities, healthcare etc.). In the context of agri-food industry, a variety of external parameters belonging to different domains (e.g. weather conditions, regulations etc.) have a major influence over the food supply chain, while flexible and adaptive IoT frameworks, essential to truly realize the concept of smart farming, are currently inexistent. In this paper, we propose Agri-IoT, a semantic framework for IoT-based smart farming applications, which supports reasoning over various heterogeneous sensor data streams in real-time. Agri-IoT can integrate multiple cross-domain data streams, providing a complete semantic processing pipeline, offering a common framework for smart farming applications.

abstract={South Korean manufacturers have dealt with supply chain interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic as many other manufacturers have around the world; however, it seems that some Korean manufacturers are remarkably resilient. Many Korean manufacturers have withstood perilous supply chain dynamism and maintained operational performance without interruption. This study examines the antecedents of supply chain resilience and operational performance to suggest how other manufacturers can develop and maintain continuous uninterrupted operations even amid dynamic supply chains and global disruption. This is an empirical study of South Korean manufacturers utilizing PLS-SEM analysis with mediation effects. This study examines the interrelationships of six variables including, supply chain disruption orientation, management’s intention, digital infrastructure capability, innovation adoption, supply chain resilience, and operational performance. The implications are meaningful for both scholars and practitioners alike.

abstract={We consider a dynamic food supply chain with multiple process steps where the decisions at each step include supplier selection and settings for their process parameters. We assume that the resulting quality level of the product at every step is stochastic. We also consider that this quality level at each supply chain step has a minimum accepted level and any product that does not meet the minimum accepted level is rejected. We propose an integrated approach that uses Big Data mining techniques to study the effect of these decisions on the quality of the final product and determine our state transition matrix. From there, stochastic optimization methods are implemented to find an optimal policy describing the preferred suppliers and settings for their process parameters. The goal of this policy is to maximize the supply chain's expected profit and reduce rejected product. We show how this technique outperforms traditional techniques in running time as the problem's complexity (state and action space size) grows. We also conduct experiments to explore how the optimal policy changes as the quality threshold for acceptance becomes more restrictive and exhibits a convex behavior. © 2020},

abstract={Background and purpose: Literature is lacking on how supply chain dynamic capabilities influence operational performance. This study aims to empirically investigate the impact of supply chain dynamic capabilities on operational performance in Hungarian manufacturing companies. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study used an online survey for data collection. The model is tested with data from 208 supply chain management professionals from Hungarian manufacturing industry. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the proposed hypotheses. Results: The empirical results indicate that supply chain dynamic capabilities namely; collaboration capability, agility capability, and responsiveness capability are significantly and positively associated with operational performance. However, the results show that integration capability has no significant impact on operational performance Conclusion: The study concludes that in a dynamic environment, developing supply chain dynamic capabilities can help manufacturing company managers to build effective supply chains and achieve superior performance. Further, managers need to recognize that supply chain dynamic capabilities are multidimensional and each dimension has different effects on operational performance. Also, the study provides theoretical and managerial implications that are further â€ discussed in detail. © 2020 Mohanad Ali Kareem et al., published by Sciendo 2020.},

abstract={Nowadays, rapid changes in customers' demands have redoubled the importance of new concepts such as supply chain flexibility and its application. The extent to which flexibility should be built into supply chains requires full consideration. Flexibility is defined as firms' quick and efficient response to changes. This paper quantifies the positive effects of adding different flexibility dimensions to a production planning bi-objective mathematical model. Four flexibility dimensions are proposed according to the needs of a production plant chosen as the case study. The objective functions are to minimize total costs along with the delivery time of the product, respectively. We also employ two metaheuristic algorithms, NSGA-Ⅱand MOPSO, to solve our proposed NP-hard model. Afterwards, we compare both solution strategies based on five criteria to achieve optimal results. Moreover, we compare the performance of both flexible and inflexible models in terms of costs. The results show that applying the flexible model causes a reduction of %22 in costs. © 2022,International Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Today, environmental awareness is highly interested in supply chains and logistics networks with regard to sustainable development goals. This proposes a bi-objective linear mathematical model comprising supply chain flexibility dimensions. The proposed model is to integrate environmental considerations into a flexible supply chain as an optimization framework. The first objective function is to minimize the costs, while the second one minimizes the environmental impacts of automotive industry. The goal of this paper is to find a trade-off between the total cost and the environmental pollution with regard to the supply chain flexibility dimensions. We suggest adding four different supply chain flexibility dimensions to the model which are budget for transportation, trained labor team to help the packaging process, number of active plants, and outsourcing the painting process flexibilities to curb harmful emissions from factories while reducing the costs. Six flexibility scenarios are proposed in this study to do the sensitivity analysis. The model is applicable with the use of a real data set derived from an automotive parts factory located in Iran. We use an improved augmented ε-constraint method to address the proposed bi-objective optimization framework. The results show that choosing the model with all flexibility dimensions is the best initiative to promote sustainable development, since it leads to a significant reduction in costs and environmental pollution. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={It is irrefutable that the construction industry is in need of a highly technological construction method or system for the simple aim of giving it a push it deserves. In Malaysia this technologically enhanced method is known as the Indutrialised Building System (IBS). Concerted efforts have been made for the past decade by various responsible parties especially by the government. Therefore, the IBS 'Road Map' 2003-2010 was introduced and now continues with the IBS 'road map' 2011-2015. However, its performance is still at its infancy, which target is only at an initial stage. This study seeks to identify and analyse the factor of the IBS' system's supply chain flexibility as a factor on the success of the system itself. It has been a suspicion that there exists a condition and situation where the supply chain is too rigid and is not flexible in fulfilling the needs and demands of the IBS development in Malaysia. This inflexible situation has brought about a broad range of problems and has stood in the way of the development of the industrialised building system, despite it being introduced since 1964, or 49 years ago. Flexibility in the IBS supply chain is very important and is associated with other industries like transportation, manufacturing industry, and others. Up until now, we have yet to discover any special studies related to the flexibility in the IBS supply chain in this country. Responding to this challenge, this research is hoped to be able to provide sufficient feedback to the solution to the IBS supply chain flexibility issue. The researcher is confident that the poor system flow of supply chain has impeded the advancement of the Industrialised Building System that has long been open to debate. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014.},

abstract={Environmental disaster and rapid climate change cautioned government bodies and environmental protection agencies, which resulted in legislations forcing business organizations to restrict their carbon emissions to make their supply chain a disaster resilient supply chain. In supply chain, carbon emissions are seen right away from the procurement of raw materials till the distribution of finished goods through logistics. Hence, there is strong need to fix carbon emissions and to make existing supply chain an environmentally sustainable supply chain to gain environmental disaster relief. This paper primarily focuses on minimizing carbon emissions in the raw material procurement and its logistics using a cap-and-trade method. In the raw material procurement and logistics, the carbon emission is caused during the ordering, transporting and holding the procured items from various suppliers. The paper aims to model sustainability-resilience link at the supply chain design level through the procurement and logistics of raw material which is considered as the primary stage of any supply chain. A dynamic non-linear mixed integer model featuring an environmental sustainability through cap-and-trade method of carbon emission is proposed that can be used to design sustainable procurement logistics for disaster resilient supply chain management. The proposed model in the paper is referred as SPL_DRSCM (sustainable procurement and logistics for disaster resilient supply chain management) and is validated through illustrations. Important useful managerial and practical insights are obtained from set of five different deterministic data sets. Proposed model for SPL_DRSCM MINLP shows significant cost saving while optimizing procurement and its logistics under carbon emission constraint. Comparative analysis is conducted and detailed numerical results are presented. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={It has been ten years since Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin and introduced the concept of a blockchain. The original goal was to propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. Now, Blockchain proves to have the capacity to deliver a new kind of trust to a wide range of services. Applications are being explored in healthcare (patient records), government (land registries) and electronics (Internet of Things). The supply chain is one of the fields that Blockchain is expected to be applied. The paper aims to combine blockchain with distributed storage and propose blockchain for the supply chain. Blockchain is not fit to record a lot of information. It requires both on-chain storage of the core ledger data and off-chain storage of data required by smart contracts for verification and documentation. The Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) is a concrete solution. IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. Participants can address large amounts of data with IPFS and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures their content, without having to put the data itself on the chain. By combining blockchain with distributed storage, the supply chain system is fit to the industry of the next generation. The characteristics of Industry 4.0 meets the blockchain-based system and the model can aid these changes. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Supply chains are gradually transforming into more global structures. To ensure sustainability and resilience in face of the problems that arise in globalizing supply chains, it is becoming an important issue today; a supply chain must be flexible, agile and responsive. Therefore, the aim of the study is to focus on resilience in sustainable global supply chains (GSC) to avoid disruptions caused by pandemics such as COVID-19; it is also conducted research on responsiveness of sustainable global supply chains during COVID-19. In this study, dynamic capability perspective and contingency theory are used to conceptualize theoretical models for COVID-19. Moreover, a partial least squares (PLS) model is used to analyse the research hypotheses with 200 responses collected from companies which have complex supply chain structures. As a novel result, the relationship between flexibility, agility and responsiveness of global supply chain is revealed. Supply chain agility is found to be directly affected by supply chain flexibility. Moreover, supply chain flexibility and supply chain agility directly affect the responsiveness of the global supply chain. In addition, the agility of the supply chain acts as a partial mediator variable in the effect of supply chain flexibility on responsiveness. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study suggests a supply chain design deploying a novel idea from production planning. The idea of capacity bottlenecks is used to improve flexibility in a multi-echelon multi-product supply chain. We suggest an optimization model that focuses on optimal capacity allocations to bottleneck points in order to enhance overall flexibility. The proposed mixed-integer linear programming model minimizes the total cost of facility establishment as well as their utilization and transportation cost. The performance of suggested model is investigated by several test problems with uncertainty in demand, cost, capacity, and product specifications. The results indicate the superiority of the suggested model to the previous flexibility formulation method. According to the numerical results, the proposed model decreases the total supply chain cost by up to 16 % on average. Another advantageous feature of the proposed model is its capability of solving previously insolvable test problems by optimizing flexibility levels. © 2016, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.},

abstract={Nowadays, pricing and remanufacturing problems under uncertain markets have gained increasing attention from both industrial and academic fields. In the literature, it is generally assumed that all the channel members are risk-neutral, ignoring the influences of channel members' risk attitudes in the face of dynamic market. This paper focuses on a pricing problem in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with two competitive risk-sensitive retailers under uncertain environment. The uncertainty is associated with the recycling costs, consumer demands and remanufacturing costs. Due to the dynamic market, supply chain managers may be unable to collect enough historical data to estimate these demands and costs when making pricing and remanufacturing decisions. In such cases, experts' estimations are usually employed to describe these uncertain parameters. To deal with these human estimations, an uncertainty theory-based model is proposed. Based on the equilibrium results, how the retailers' risk sensitivity and human estimations (uncertain degrees) affect the prices and profits is analyzed. It is found that both the retailers will get lower profits while the manufacturer will gain more profit when either of the two retailers becomes more risk-averse. We also find that a higher level of uncertainty in the supply chain will induce a higher collecting rate. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

abstract={In 2007 and 2008, Bangladesh was subject to a food crisis - the outcome of multiple causes - which had a severe impact on the urban poor of the country's capital. Dhaka's food supplies were repeatedly disconnected due to floods and cyclones, yet there was always enough food in the megacity thanks to wholesale traders' diverse and flexible supply networks. Despite the interim government's eviction drives aimed at slum dwellers and street vendors, the food hawkers still managed to distribute prepared food throughout the city. And despite rapidly rising food prices, most of the urban poor found ways to endure the crisis. In this article, we look at the people who made Dhaka's food system resilient enough to avoid catastrophe. We discuss three relevant actor groups - food traders in wholesale markets, street food vendors, and poor consumers - and investigate the roles they play in keeping the city fed, and how they act in the light of crises. Neither these actors nor their contributions to urban food security are acknowledged by the state, nor are they substantially supported. Significant potentials for a resilient urban food system thus remain unpromoted and even blocked. Resilience is being refused.},

abstract={Adaptive and highly synchronized supply chains can avoid a cascading rise-and-fall inventory dynamic and mitigate ripple effects caused by operational failures. This paper aims to demonstrate how a deep reinforcement learning agent based on the proximal policy optimization algorithm can synchronize inbound and outbound flows and support business continuity operating in the stochastic and nonstationary environment if end-to-end visibility is provided. The deep reinforcement learning agent is built upon the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, which does not require hardcoded action space and exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. These features, complimented with a straightforward supply chain environment, give rise to a general and task unspecific approach to adaptive control in multi-echelon supply chains. The proposed approach is compared with the base-stock policy, a well-known method in classic operations research and inventory control theory. The base-stock policy is prevalent in continuous-review inventory systems. The paper concludes with the statement that the proposed solution can perform adaptive control in complex supply chains. The paper also postulates fully fledged supply chain digital twins as a necessary infrastructural condition for scalable real-world applications. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Purpose – This paper aims to empirically explore demand-related information sharing in the extended supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – Through a single, embedded case design, a range of methods are used to collect data from companies representing three different supply chain tiers, including focal company, first-tier suppliers and first-tier customers. The collected data are analysed through the theoretical lens of interdependence. Findings – The findings indicate that the supply chain actors adapt information sharing to the pooled, serial or reciprocal type of interdependence. Information sharing is thus increased with key dyadic partners representing, for example, unique offerings and high market shares as percentage of total expenditure/sales. The study also unearths several barriers to information sharing beyond dyadic ties, including problems related to dis-aggregated, misinterpreted and/or incomplete information. Research limitations/implications – The study empirically contributes to the existing literature by exploring information sharing in the extended supply chain and by suggesting different approaches to information sharing depending on the type and intensity of interdependence between supply chain partners. Further, the paper contributes to the existing literature on barriers of information sharing in supply chains by identifying barriers specific to multi-tier information sharing. “Meta-information” (i.e. information about the shared information) is needed to overcome some of the barriers of sharing information in cases of weak, pooled interdependencies in the supply chain. Practical implications – Similar to previous empirical research, this exploratory study indicates that companies, in general, refrain from sharing information beyond dyadic ties. Supply chain managers would instead mostly focus on stronger, reciprocal interdependencies and emphasise dyadic information sharing. To further guide managers, a demand profiling framework considering market share and demand uncertainty is presented. It may be interesting to engage in multi-tier information sharing in particular cases where strong interdependence exists between three or more partners. Originality/value – This study contributes to existing research on information sharing in supply chains by empirically studying information sharing in an extended supply chain, applying interdependence theory as its analytical framework and unearthing several barriers that are specific to multi-tier information sharing. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper presents the integration of geographical information into an agent-based simulation model, named Supply Chain Building Blocks (SCBB), for enhancing its performance analysis of supply chain designs. Geographical information improves the modelling accuracy of the supply chain's static and dynamic elements for the spatial and temporal characterization. In the SCBB, static elements are the geographically located supply chain participants (modelled as generic agents) and the routes describing their interconnections. Dynamic supply chain elements are the transportation agents, who emulate the multi-modal material flows. Intances of transportation agent move material based on the lead times resulting from the transportation's mode attributes and the routes' description. Supply chain participants in SCBB incorporate geographical information to evaluate their behavioural policies for emulating business functions and for communicating with other agents. The use of geographical information enhances the SCBB modelling capabilities by supporting the holistic performance analysis of supply chain designs for the strategic decision-making (e.g. capacity allocation and location decisions), business functions configuration (e.g. management strategies for sourcing, inventory, production and distribution) and phenomena understanding (e.g. complexity management, risk management and green logistics). © 2012 EUROSIS-ETI.},

abstract={In today's market conditions, volume of demand is quite uncertain and thus it is hard to estimate. In many cases, buyer is prone to use supply chain flexibility rather than inventory holding strategy to withstand demand uncertainty. We assume that the buyer releases a replenishment order to the supplier for each cycle (or period) under the contract which is mainly composed of four parameters: (1) supply cost per unit, (2) minimum order quantity, (3) order quantity reduction penalty and (4) maximum capacity of the supplier. Based on these parameters, there are two flexibility options that buyer should evaluate in the order of cycle (1) issue an order smaller than the minimum order quantity and pay the related penalty and (2) place no order and lose the sales. Hence, Q lost emerges as a critical buyer decision, the order quantity, below which no order is placed. Total expected supply cost plus lost sales, as a function of Q lost is presented. We derive the optimal Q lost that minimises the total cost function. Since capacity of each supplier is finite, we then develop a supplier selection model with total cost minimisation over the suppliers subject to capacity constraint that has a stochastic nature stemming from demand behaviour. Linearisation on the model is performed using chance-constrained programming approach. From a given set of supply bids from the potential supply chain partners, the buyer is able to make a quantifiable choice. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={Factors driving the choice of shipper firms for services of logistics service providers have long been recognized in the freight transportation literature. However, the willingness among shippers to choose flexible transportation services, where the service package can be adapted during planning and execution, has received less attention. In particular, little is known about the contextual circumstances under which shippers would be inclined to select such flexible transportation service. In this study, experimental scenarios and discrete choice modeling are used to investigate the willingness among shippers to use flexible transportation services. We estimate multinomial logit, mixed logit, and latent class models for a sample of nearly 200 global shipper firms and calculate willingness-to-pay measures for flexibility. The findings indicate that flexible services are essential in demand-volatile markets. Since logistics services may provide external flexibility for shipper firms, we also study which related internal flexibilities in supply chains drive these choices. In particular, our findings show that it is mainly the volume flexibility of shippers that mediates the choice of flexible transportation services. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Fulfilment of the underlying structure within an indivisible system which leads to a specific pattern of behaviour was previously addressed by prominent approaches. However, there was a considerable lack for proposal of a proper idea that considers the susceptibility of structures to change with time through other adjacent structures. Considering such a point of view necessitates an alternative approach to functional perspective. Thus, a process-oriented architectural decomposition of a simplified organization structure embedded in a supply chain is applied to analyse the structure dynamics. This novel perspective to dynamic multi-structure systems is introduced in this research and the comparison with its function-oriented perspective is studied. Furthermore, the critical role of enterprise resource planning systems for data acquisition, analysis and retrieval in such a complicated worldview into organizations is discussed. Moreover, the value added to enhance these planning systems by this perspective is specified. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the problem of dynamic supply chain (SC) recovery. We consider effectiveness and efficiency of various reactive measures to recover the SC with the minimum cost at the operational level. For this purpose, a new general model based on bounded optimal control theory is developed to determine the type, the extent, and the timing of reactive measures. We demonstrate its application using an example of a two-echelon poultry SC. The intention of the proposed model is to optimise both the recovery and its costs simultaneously. The developed model is solved exactly using the Pontryagin’s maximum principle. We performed a set of sensitivity analyses to illustrate the model's behaviour. The results obtained from applying the dynamic recovery model in the case study show that the proposed model can help SC managers to deal with disruptions by comparing alternative recovery options, based on two important criteria of the time and cost of SC's recovery. The findings of this research advocate the consideration of dynamic SC characteristics and the need for simultaneous attention to the effectiveness and efficiency of reactive measures in recovery planning. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Reconfigurable manufacturing systems are complex systems that are prone to malfunctions and performance decay. Thus, such systems need to be safeguarded against quality issues and decline in production efficiency to ensure the optimal health of machines. The product quality and health of a reconfigurable manufacturing system can be analyzed by using the diagnosability characteristic. This study examines the diagnosability characteristic in a multi-stage reconfigurable manufacturing system. The aim is to understand the impact of time-based diagnostics on the functionality performance of a reconfigurable manufacturing system and the level of inventory used during production. The diagnosability is analyzed regarding product variation and system diagnosability. A mathematical model is proposed, and it is subsequently applied in deterministic and stochastic settings. The deterministic setting is examined through a set of two problem-specific heuristics. The stochastic setting, subject to the gamma process, is examined by using a simulation-based optimization approach. The results suggest that the use of line replacement units can restore a reconfigurable system to optimal functionality, reduce the level of inventory, and complete production in a minimum time at the expense of additional cost. These findings apply to the context of healthcare emergency response systems, reconfigurable supply chains, reconfigurable integrated manufacturing systems, etc. Finally, a conclusion and future research avenues are provided. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: Supply chain integration (SCI) and flexibility (SCF) are recognised as crucial business practices and capability in the global competitive market. However, limited research has paid attention to study the relationship between SCI, SCF and their impact on supply chain performance (SCP). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to establish a relationship between integration, flexibility and performance. Design/methodology/approach: The structural equation modelling technique was used to analyse the 187 data collected from Indian organisations through the survey methodology. Findings: Findings indicate that external integration contributes significantly to realise SCF and SCP. Sourcing and logistics flexibility also help to improve the SCP. The mediation analysis showed that the association of customer and supplier integration with SCP is partially and fully mediated by logistics flexibility, respectively. This study suggests that integration influences the SCP when the firm has a strong association with downstream partners and enough capability for logistics flexibility. Research limitations/implications: The study has collected cross-sectional data to analyse the relationship between SCI, SCF and SCP. However, as integration requires an effort of the years, longitudinal data and industry-specific studies may provide comprehensive views to validate the results of this study. Originality/value: Building on relational view theory and dynamic capability theory, the study has proposed the SCP assessment framework based on the relationship between SCI and SCF. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: Building on a relational view and dynamic capability theory, this paper argues that integrated flexibility is the strategy that enables organisations to achieve different positions and states to create distinctive capability. The article has proposed the conceptual framework that connects different supply chain strategies and practices to improve supply chain performance (SCP) considering the cross-disciplinary approach. Findings: The conceptual framework around the new perspective, i.e. integrated flexibility, is built to deal with issues related to operations management. The paper suggests examining the mediating effect of SCF between SCI and SCP and the moderating role of knowledge management (KM), data analytics (DA) and quality management (QM) practices on their relationship. Moreover, research direction in terms of propositions and implications are developed to showcase how underlying practices streamline the supply chain and lead to superior SCP. Practical implications: The proposed framework discusses the degree of integration and flexibility levels to guide practitioners in designing a supply chain strategy with their partners and answering how much resources need to be extended to achieve flexible operations and realise SCP.

abstract={Two different bullwhip effects with equal scores may have different sensitivities and production patterns. As a result, the difference between these two seemingly equal scores has been ignored in previous methods (such as frequency response and moving average). So, the present study constructs a model of Inverse Network Data Envelopment Analysis, to introduce the relative and interval scores of the bullwhip effect magnitude, when a series of uncertain demands are made in a specific time interval. In the first stage of the proposed network, the uncertain demands and the forecasted uncertain data are regarded respectively as the model’s inputs and outputs. These output data constitute the intermediate variables and consequently the inputs of the second stage of the study model. In the second stage, after considering the ordering policies, the uncertain orders are sent. Due to utilizing both the optimistic and pessimistic perspectives, the study methodology includes an interval value for measuring the bullwhip effect with relative attitude. In the optimistic perspective, the analyzed decision making unit has the optimal status in comparison with other decision making units. In the pessimistic perspective, the analyzed decision making unit has the worst status in comparison with other decision making units. The results show that time is an unfair factor in the size of the bullwhip effect. The impact of uncertainties on the bullwhip effect in the demand forecasting stage is greater than the ordering stage. According to the research findings, cross-sectional planning is possible at different times according to different conditions. Therefore, using the results of the research, a fair score of the bullwhip effect can be obtained by considering all perspectives. © 2021 Qazvin Islamic Azad University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The main objective of this research is to investigate the impact of manufacturing flexibility and technological dimensions of manufacturing strategy on responsiveness in the supply chain. Based on the theoretical background of dynamic capability, this study also examines the role of the business environment on the relationship between manufacturing flexibility and supply chain responsiveness. 144 structured surveys were collected and the partial least squares of structural equation modelling approach were utilised for data analysis. The result establishes relationships among various dimensions of manufacturing flexibility. Although the technological dimensions in manufacturing strategy of such advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) and e-procurement do not have any direct impact on new product and market flexibility, they increase supply chain responsiveness, which helps to react quickly against supply chain disruptions. More importantly, the business environment has a moderating effect on the relationship between market flexibility and supply chain responsiveness. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

In this study, we tested our hypothesis using structural equation model analysis to verify the structural relationship between dynamic capability and business performance in the smart supply chain environment of Korean small and medium manufacturers. We confirmed through this that dynamic capability and environmental uncertainty in a smart supply chain environment have a partially significant effect on business performance and that manufacturers must strive to implement direct, systematic policies and improve dynamic capability to respond to an uncertain business environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The balancing of demand and supply in the market is complex because of the dynamic supply chain and environment. It causes uncertain situations and is a limitation in decisions making systems that cannot produce reasonable descriptions to help decision makers eliminate uncertainties. This study proposes designing and developing a Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs) model for market understanding, which encodes a human-like approach to explain demand and supply events for decision makers. A framework for generating reasonable descriptions in Agricultural Supply Chains (ASCs) management is proposed. The qualitative and quantitative design of the CBNs model is developed and proved that the CBNs model can reasonably explain events using predictive performance measurement and sensitivity analysis for producing reasonable descriptions. The results illustrate that the CBNs model is suitable for ASCs situation explanation involving uncertain situations and is ready to apply to real-world applications to support decision-making systems. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Multi-echelon inventory optimization literature distinguishes stochastic- (SS) and guaranteed-service (GS) approaches as mutually exclusive frameworks. While the GS approach considers flexibility measures at the stages to deal with stockouts, the SS approach only relies on safety stock. Within a supply chain, flexibility levels might differ between stages rendering them appropriate candidates for one approach or the other. The existing approaches, however, require the selection of a single framework for the entire supply chain instead of a stage-wise choice. We develop an integrated hybrid-service (HS) approach which endogenously determines the overall cost-optimal approach for each stage and computes the required inventory levels. We present a dynamic programming optimization algorithm for serial supply chains that partitions the entire system into subchains of different types. From a numerical study we find that, besides implicitly choosing the better of the two pure frameworks, whose cost differences can be considerable, the HS approach enables additional pipeline and on-hand stock cost savings. We further identify drivers for the preferability of the HS approach. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to examine the effect of external supply chain (SC) flexibility on the product innovation performance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the contingent role of informal control mechanisms in moderating such an effect. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 236 UK-based SME manufacturers. Findings: Inbound supplier flexibility (ISF) has a stronger positive effect on SMEs’ product innovation performance than outbound logistics flexibility (OLF), and that the strength and direction of both effects depend on informal control mechanisms. Lead supplier influence negatively moderates the relationship between ISF and product innovation performance but positively moderates the relationship between OLF and product innovation performance. Normative integration positively moderates the relationship between ISF and product innovation performance. Research limitations/implications: This study enriches SC flexibility studies by focusing on understanding the differential effects of ISF and OLF on product innovation performance, as well as the role that contingency factors play in these relationships in the SME context. Practical implications: To promote product innovation performance, SME managers should focus on building good relationships with their suppliers rather than their logistics service providers. SME managers should be particularly aware of the different types of informal control mechanisms that govern their SC relationships and adjust their managerial approaches accordingly. Originality/value: This study distinguishes between ISF and OLF and examines their impacts on SMEs’ product innovation performance. This study investigates the differential effects of lead supplier influence and normative integration on the relationship between external SC flexibility and SMEs’ product innovation performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Increasing occurrences of natural disturbances, including windstorms and high snow cover, and supply chain risks lead to severe irregularities in wood harvest and transport. To overcome resulting supply difficulties, innovative multimodal systems via rail terminals are promising options offering the potential to increase buffer capacity, improve supply chain resilience, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, a train terminal is included in a virtual simulation environment spanning the entire wood supply chain from forest to industry to test, analyze, and evaluate a complex multimodal system in different scenario settings. Furthermore, the simulation model provides intuitive decision support through animation and a cockpit of key performance indicators, facilitating hands-on workshops with supply chain managers. Results show the advantage of a combination of unimodal and multimodal transport in the wood supply chain of the observed case-study region. This combination proves to be resilient and outperforms other tested supply chain strategies by avoiding both bottlenecks and ill-timed plans and reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Furthermore, workshops conducted with industry experts indicate that adapting collaborative supply chain control strategies by means of a participatory simulation environment enhances the development of advanced risk management and therefore improves supply chain resilience, efficiency, and sustainability. © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.

This study proposes a system for modeling and simulating a supply chain in which portable machine tools are shared among the suppliers and relocated in order to adapt to machine tool breakdowns and manufacturing volume excesses. The system supports complex decision making in terms of the logistics of these machine tools with a view to decreasing the average completion time of manufacturing tasks without adding machine tools into the supply chain as a whole.},

abstract={The fast changing business environment and the intensive market competition forces firms to adjust and remodel their business strategy continuously. As a solution, firms seek flexibility, not only internally but also at the level of their supply chain. To accomplish this, companies invest in information technology (IT), aiming to improve their business processes and collaboration with trading partners. As previous research supports, the use of IT combined with agile supply chain management improves business performance and offers sustainable competitive advantage. However, the extent to which IT enables and supports supply chain flexibility is still debatable and warrants investigation. Although contemporary Internet-based systems (web-based platforms and cloud-based solutions) seem to overcome the rigidity and inflexibility of traditional interorganisational systems (IOS), they are still associated with issues of interoperability and incompatibility. Although they facilitate supply chain collaboration, by providing access to all stakeholders and enabling information-sharing, they may often lead to closed networks of collaboration. To examine these issues, this paper primarily aims to clarify the notion of flexibility at the level of the supply chain. It also aims to contribute to the process by which organisations effectively evaluate and prioritise competing IT investments. Taking into consideration the multidimensional nature of flexibility, this paper proposes a conceptual framework of supply chain flexibility, distinguishing between the operational, structural, and strategic levels of flexibility.

abstract={Supply chain management has both in academia and practice proven its important role to sustain and further develop companies’ competitive advantages. This is with initiatives that focus on cost-efficiencies and turnover improvement. During the last two decades, companies have faced complexity in their supply chains currently with increased global operations. The dynamic business environment forces companies to secure a competitive (re-) design of their supply chains. This paper seeks to advance the understanding on the drivers and barriers for such designs. In total, 39 experts (30 from industrial enterprises, 4 senior supply chain consultants and 5 supply chain management professors) have participated in a four-step Delphi study and have identified main drivers for dynamic supply chain design as being cost reduction, delivery reliability and change in demand for agility. The main barriers are identified as forecasting being too weak, supply chain complexity and product portfolio complexity. In addition, an explorative factor analysis has been carried out to identify how drivers and barriers can be grouped together. Finally, the paper compares the drivers and barriers underlining different competitive strategies. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Turbulent environment and large demand fluctuations induce numerous enterprises to cooperate with other organizations in supply networks. Enterprises try to cooperate in different configurations enabling an increase in value added. Since the basic processes forming the usefulness of form, place and time are production operations and logistic processes, hence cooperation in these two task areas is increasingly essential. Therefore, subcontracting of production and logistic tasks is an essential factor determining the structure of contemporary supply chains which are called network chains. The resistance of network supply chains to disruptions is the same important exploratory area. Moreover, from the perspective of individual chain links forming a network supply chain, an essential issue is the skill of adapting itself to variable conditions of the environment and changes in the structure of the chain itself. The article took into consideration both of the exploratory areas: The resistance of network supply chains to disruptions and adaptive strategies of chain links in a supply chain.

A two-stage programming is composed according to Benders decomposition by allocating inventory in advance and anticipating the changes of transportation routings; thus the transportation routing is stochastic in nature. In addition, the fuzzy shortest path is developed to solve the problem complexity in terms of the multi-criteria of lead time and capacity with an efficient computational method. The results and analysis indicate that the proposed two-stage programming with fuzzy shortest path surpasses the performance of shortest path problem with time windows and capacity constraint (SPPTWCC) in terms of less computational time and CPU memory consumption.

The objective of this article is to use an axiomatic approach to make assembly planning by designing and integrating assembly into supply chain planning, particularly during supply chain reconfiguration. The effect of fixture layout planning, the accuracy of demand forecast, and the supplier capability of providing the required material quality are studied. An optimum supply chain network is configured by combining the product, assembly, and supply chain planning. Heuristic-based optimization is used to validate the proposed solution. The performance of the system is measured in terms of lead time variability, the number of backorders, and the level of safety stock. The results and analysis indicate that the axiomatic approach is capable of reducing the assembly variation and employing necessary fixture layout planning to deliver product intents. In addition, the reduction of assembly variation also reduces the safety stock, lead time variability, and backorders.

The results show that the adaptive fuzzy VMI control surpasses fuzzy VMI control and traditional VMI in terms of mitigating the Bullwhip effect and lower delivery overshoots and backorders.

abstract={A manufacturing service capability (MSC) model is essential for correct communication of MSC information between dynamic supply chain (DSC) partners. MSC information elicits service details such as locations, specialisations, capacities, certifications, and software and material processing capabilities. Presently, as in the case of web portal-enabled supply chain communications, this information is communicated using models that provide limited semantic precision. These models are also proprietary to specific industry communities; hence, access to MSC information across communities is limited. This article describes deployment of the reference-ontology-based semantic mediation approach using Web Ontology Language (OWL). The mediation introduces shared semantics that enhances access to and precision of proprietary MSC models encoded in relational databases. Detailed deployment steps are discussed using a manufacturing sourcing use case. In the first step, we analyse three alternative conventions for encoding proprietary MSC models into OWL and show that the ontology-oriented encoding convention is most suitable for semantic mediation in OWL. In the deployment step, single- or multi-community deployment is possible. It is shown that the single-community deployment enables precise and greater access to MSC information within the community, while the multi-community deployment additionally enables interoperable access to MSC information across the communities. © This work was authored as part of the Contributors official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

abstract={The exchange of accurate, computer-interpretable information is critical in todays dynamic supply chains in which manufacturers come and go as needed. This exchange begins when manufacturers, who hope to join the supply chain, provide the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) with information regarding their production capabilities. These capabilities are represented electronically in what are called manufacturing service capability (MSC) models. These models are frequently proprietary, which makes them difficult to access, and imprecise, which makes them difficult to use. Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a powerful language for capturing the semantics of such models. OWL can enhance both precision and accessibility, but it requires semantic mediation to resolve semantic conflicts and more importantly to enhance model semantics. Semantic-mediation approaches can generally be classified into two approaches mapping-based and reference-ontology-based. This paper characterises and compares the two approaches. Characterisation is based on examples of proprietary MSC models and by deployment criteria including mediation quality, scalability, evolution, and knowledge organisation. Comparison is based on the behaviours and trade-offs of the two approaches in the context of these deployment criteria. The paper also provides a decision-making template associated with these criteria. Finally, the paper uses this template to show under what conditions each mediation technique is preferred.© 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

The model can be approximated as a linear discrete system with various operating constants, like lead time, price, order policy and supply. Findings: The continuous replenishment ordering policy for a distribution node in a supply chain was analyzed using the z-transform. Characteristic equations of the closed loop transfer function are obtained. The bullwhip (BW) effect is analyzed. Study proves that the BW effect is in evitable if the standard heuristic ordering policy is employed with demand forecasting; also the paper analysed price supply trade-off for dynamic demand and supply.

abstract={In recent years, supply chains seem to be moving more towards reconfiguring their networks to become more profitable. In the times of COVID-19, where the whole supply chains have been disrupted, suppliers are unable to supply, and manufacturers are unable to manufacture because of lockdowns in the various regions around the world. This pandemic can be compared to past earthquakes and tsunamis, as the coronavirus is also a natural disaster. Due to these past disruptions, organizations have taken many precautions and developed risk mitigation strategies to manage them. Because the COVID-19 outbreak shows the importance of new business perspectives like repurposing a viability strategy, that comes with sustainability and reconfigurability. Where reconfiguration focuses on adaptation, which directly means changes in resources and capabilities and repurposing focuses on a quick response solution to address the shortage. In this paper, a study has been done in two phases to model viability in an automobile supply chain during the COVID-19 times. In the first phase, a hybrid Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach is used to get the best criteria and alternatives with sustainability and reconfigurability under consideration. The multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) model has been developed in the second phase. Suppliers' weight that is obtained will be used to get the optimal order and allocation. This model will help develop supply chain strategies to cope with situations that hinder the firm's competitiveness. A case study of an Indian automobile manufacturer has been taken to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology using GAMS/CPLEX solver. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Today, there are growing challenges on business environment because of increase in competition and customer expectations.selection of supplier and later order allocation is an essential subject matter in the area of supply chains. An well-ordered and flexible supply chain allows the firm to choose the correct suppliers at the right time for the right kind of materials, with reduced purchase cost, thereby improving competitiveness. Supply chains have the basic characteristics like multiple conflicting criteria, demand uncertainties, lead time and delivery uncertainties. In the literature isolated studies on supplier selection using mathematical models, multiple criteria decision making techniques and multiple stakeholder requirements are commonly found. Integration of these aspects give promising results. The correlated Analytic Hierarchy (CAHP) considers the correlation effect between criteria in the Analytic Hierarchy process. Linear physical programming (LPP) is a multi-objective optimization method that develops an aggregate objective function of the criteria in a piecewise, goal-programming fashion. LPP model enables decision maker to think about multiple criteria (i.e., cost, customer service, and rejections) and to express criteria preferences in terms of degrees of desirability. This paper proposes an integrated method for dealing with such problems using correlated Analytic Hierarchy- and linear physical programming techniques. The method proposed demonstrates selection of appropriate suppliers and allocates orders optimally among them.finally model calculation is presented. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Infectious diseases a curse for humanity can be curbed through immunization. Vaccination can make people more resilient toward infectious diseases and the safety of the vaccine is of prime importance for public health. A smart vaccine management system can address the issue of vaccine expiration and counterfeiting. The study was conducted in twofolds: Stage I, a quantitative cross-sectional survey design was deployed to understand stakeholder adoption intention (ADI) toward blockchain-enabled vaccine supply chain through extended technology adoption model using partial least square structural equation modeling. Findings entail stakeholders' trust and perceived ease of use for blockchain-enabled vaccine supply chain directly affect perceived usefulness (PUS) and individual subjective norm. PUS significantly influences the ADI of stakeholders toward blockchain in the vaccine supply chain. Stage II, a blockchain integrated vaccine supply chain architecture with Internet of things devices was proposed to bring transparency and flexibility to the vaccine supply chain. Architecture would benefit the beneficiary to approve or disapprove the vaccines through the self-generated report and medical health centers can see the efficacy of vaccines before clinical delivery to patients. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={Supply Chain System is an integral part of decision making in an organization. This involves a systematic and strategic coordination process to improve the overall efficiency of the organization. Due to a complex dynamic environment, supply chain management requires tools that can support individuals in making decisions. However, with the uncertain repercussion of inefficient decisions on an organization, the impact of the decisions made must be evaluated. One of the most effective and efficient tools for this purpose is Simulation. Different simulation techniques have been used in past to support supply chain management. We propose a bottom-up actor based simulation technique to capture the emergent behavior of individual decisions at the organization level. In this paper, we demonstrate a case study on decision making in supply chain system of an automotive industry. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={This paper identifies and models enablers of inland water transport mode in India. A well-known technique of Total Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM) has been used to develop the hierarchal structural model. The input to this model has come from an extensive literature review, Pentagon model based stakeholder analysis, after which several idea engineering workshops were conducted involving stakeholders. The structural model so developed is based upon ten enablers. However, this model was further analysed using Fuzzy-MICMAC and TISM approach. The extensive analysis in integrated model pointed towards the major driving power with the enablers ‘Regulator’, and ‘Incentives’. ‘Project Management’ came at the centre of the framework driven by other enablers like ‘Fairway’, ‘Private Investment’, ‘Public funding’, and ‘Cargo assurance’. This model depicts the practical use of multimodal transport in Inland waterborne transportation. Multimodal transport enhances supply chain flexibility by improving its logistics flexibility component. This model has been adopted and is successfully creating value for the government as well as for the private partners, and tells a successful story of public-private partnership in Inland Waterborne Transportation. © 2017, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.},

abstract={Purpose: In the context of emerging economies, the purpose of this paper is to seek the critical success factors (CSFs) of supply chain and identify their relationships to enhance the supply chain performance (SCP) in a sample of Indian manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of a comprehensive literature review, the authors conducted this study and proposed a new model of antecedent and outcomes for SCP in emerging markets. The empirical data for this study were drawn from a survey of 227 Indian firms, resulting in a response rate of 52 percent. The method of confirmatory factor analysis was applied to refine the CSFs and SCP scale for empirical analysis. The data were analyzed by employing the structural equation modeling technique. Findings: The results reveal that all the identified CSFs, namely, agility, flexibility, flexible innovation, information and communication technology, collaboration among conglomerate divisions, process structure, and training and leadership programs, are positively associated with SCP. The empirical study of 227 Indian firms lent good support to the hypotheses and validates it by the data analysis. Consequently, these findings highlight the prominence of these factors of supply chain for gaining a sustainable competitive advantage in emerging market scenario. Research limitations/implications: The study emphasizes on CSFs in emerging markets that will help to boost the organization’s SCP through agility and flexibility in supply chain. This study is applicable for growing markets in which there is ample amount of resources. Originality/value: As economic growth stagnates in developed economies, emerging markets grow at near double-digit rates. Somehow, this study is pioneer in terms of enhance SCP in emerging market scenario. Moreover, the outcome of the study could provide empirical evidence of the effects of CSFs on SCPs. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The framework identifies flexibility objectives and its contributing attributes at four levels of the supply chain and suggests taxonomy of flexibility performance measures. A methodology to prioritise the contribution of each performance attribute to achieve the desired flexibility objective using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has also been proposed and demonstrated in this study. The research is based on detailed literature-based study and analysis of existing frameworks of flexibility performance measurement in supply chain and expert opinion. The proposed framework is suitable for measurement, monitoring and controlling flexibility in a supply chain in addition to prioritising contributing attributes of flexibility.

abstract={Additive manufacturing (AM) appears to be a particularly attractive use case for blockchain. This research combines inductive in-depth interviews with the Delphi method to explore what potentials blockchain technology in AM creates, which adoption barriers firms need to overcome, and how supply chains will be affected by the integration of these two potentially disruptive technologies. The results suggest opportunities that are related to intellectual property (IP) rights management, the monitoring of printed parts throughout their lifecycle, process improvements, and data security. The most important barriers for blockchain adoption in AM are an absence of blockchain-skilled specialists on the labor market, missing governance mechanisms, and a lack of firm-internal technical expertise. By addressing important limitations of AM, blockchain is expected to improve the competitiveness of AM in parts’ production, catalyzing the trend toward more decentralized manufacturing resulting in more agile, resilient, and flexible supply chains and reduced logistics costs. Beyond that, blockchain-based AM platforms are expected to enhance supply chain visibility, drive supply chain digitalization, support supply chain finance, and contribute to the emergence of shared factory systems. © 2019 Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals},

abstract={Purpose: International supply chains can be severely disrupted by failures in international logistics processes. Therefore, an understanding of international logistics risks, or causes of failure, how these may interact with each other and how they can be mitigated are imperatives for the smooth operation of international supply chains. The purpose of this paper is to specifically investigate the interactions between international logistics risks within the prevailing structures of international supply chains and highlights how these risks may be inter-connected and amplified. A new dynamic supply chain logistics risk analysis model is proposed which is novel as it provides a holistic understanding of the risk event interactivity. Design/methodology/approach: The paper applies interpretive structural modelling to data collected from a survey of leading supply chain practitioners, in order to analyse their perspectives of risk elements and interactions. The risk elements and their contextual relationship were derived empirically through the use of focus groups and subsequent Delphi study. The two stages of the research rely on experts’ views on risk events and clusters and the level of interactions among those clusters. Findings: A key finding of this research is that supply chain practitioner’s perception of risk consists of inter-connected four levels: value streams risks; information and relationship risks; risks in international supply chain activities; and external environment. In particular, since level 2 risk creates feedback loops of risks, risk management at level 2 can dampen the amplification effect and the strength of the interactions. Practical implications: Several managerial implications are drawn. First, the research guides managers in the identification and evaluation of risk events which can impact the performance of their international logistics supply chain operations. Second, evidence is presented that supports the proposition that the relationships with trading partners and LSPs, and the degree of logistics information exchange, are critical to prevent, or at least mitigate, logistics risks which can substantially affect the responsiveness of the international supply chain. Originality/value: The main contribution to knowledge that this study offers to the literature on supply chain risk management is the development of a supply chain logistics risk analysis model which includes both risk elements and interactions. The research demonstrates the importance of taking into account risk interactions in the process of identification and evaluation of risk events. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The occurrence of disaster and crisis is increasing. They are complex as well as challenging for humanitarian organizations (HOs) and societies involved in disaster relief operations. This study examined the nexus between supply chain flexibility (SCF) and humanitarian supply chain performance (HSCP) among HOs with empirical evidence from HOs in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed the quantitative method to explore the interdependencies among the variables. In congruence with this, the study employed the purposive and convenience sampling technique to obtain information from 168 respondents. The analysis was done using SPSS version 23 and Smart PLS version 3. Findings: The outcome indicates that intercluster coordination (ICC) plays a significant mediating role between SCF and HSCP. Practical implications: The outcome of the study indicates that a closer and stronger relationship ensures proper channel use among the HOs. This will improve the performance of the supply chain of HOs and their ability to deal with supply chain uncertainties. Originality/value: The discovery of this study provides empirical support to the resource-based view theory. Thus, practitioners in the humanitarian setting give priority to factors that could enhance flexibility in their supply chain as well as implement coordination strategies to achieve a responsive humanitarian supply chain (HSC) system in the quest to minimize the outcome of disasters. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) are acknowledged as important R&amp;D priorities to achieve environmental goals set for next decades. This work studies biomass-based energy supply chains with CO2 capture and utilisation. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. This study presents a flexible supply chain superstructure to answer issues on economic and environmental benefits achievable by integrating biomass-coal plants, CO2 capture and utilisation plants; i.e. location of intermediate steps, fraction of CO2 emissions captured per plant, CO2 utilisation plants' size, among others. Moreover, eventual incentives and environmental revenues will be discussed to make an economically feasible project. A large-size case study located in Spain will be presented to highlight the proposed approach. Two key scenarios are envisaged: (i) Biomass, capture or utilisation of CO2 are not contemplated; (ii) Biomass, capture and CO2 utilisation are all considered. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The semiconductor sector is undergoing one of the fastest market growths. Demand is increasing and market forecasts are optimistic. New markets are emerging and product portfolios are broadening significantly. Dynamic supply chains are developing with increasing number of customers, products, suppliers and manufacturing partnerships. Up to now due to modeling complexity and computation time constraints, disjoint systems are used for local supply chain control and optimization. For efficient control, these complex semiconductor supply chains require a global approach for simulation and optimization. This is the motivation for this conceptual paper. In the conceptual part this paper introduces and discusses novel model aggregation approaches and model validity improvements with novel hierarchical modeling concepts. In the modeling part this paper incorporates that into an aggregated simulation model approach as well as a novel hierarchical interface concept for coupling of disaggregated analytical and simulation models to systematically improve overall model validity at Bosch. © 2018 IEEE},

abstract={The concept of the digital supply chain (DSC) has gained prominence across industry, business, and commerce, as it opens up new business opportunities and new business models and has the potential to revolutionize supply chain performance. Accordingly, supply chain managers are viewing the DSC as a critical source of value creation and competitive advantage. Yet, many firms are still in the early stages of adoption and there is a lack of understanding of how the DSC can develop supply chain capabilities or improve supply chain performance. The DSC concept has not yet been appropriately theoretically grounded. Drawing on dynamic capabilities and ambidexterity, we present a set of six propositions showing how digital ambidexterity can be achieved to generate high levels of supply chain performance. We introduce a conceptual framework that underlines the importance of dynamic supply chain capabilities, including visibility, agility, and flexibility, in the design of the DSC-building process. We highlight the need to possess these capabilities to create ambidextrous supply chain capabilities. The conceptual framework explains how digital technologies support and interact to enable digital ambidexterity. This chapter sets the stage for an ambitious research agenda focused on Digital Supply Chain Strategy to achieve sustainable performance gains. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: Maritime supply chains rely on electronic and paper-based processes, leading to efficiency bottlenecks. The purpose of this paper is to propose a theory for how implementing digitalization in the form of blockchain technology (BCT) can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of maritime supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper is grounded in dynamic capabilities, supply-chain management and digital supply-chain theories. Relevant literature is scrutinized to explain how BCT can improve supply-chain performance. Findings: BCT mainly benefits supply-chain performance through the development of intangible capabilities, by leveraging the capabilities (resources) that maritime supply chains provide. Research limitations/implications: This framework sets an analytical basis for future empirical research on BCT and maritime supply chains. As such, it can give only indications and aid in the theory-building process. Discussion on the value and effects of BCT on maritime supply chains is ongoing. Finally, the framework focuses on the application of one information technology in managing logistics activities, rather than taking a bundling approach. Practical implications: Investments in digitalization improve the overall information sharing, coordination and visibility capabilities and performances of supply chains. Originality/value: Although literature on BCT is extensive, this framework paper is the first to link BCT with dynamics capabilities and maritime supply-chain theory and will serve as a road map for future research and practice. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This research has considered reliability while developing a method for finding ordering policy for multiple supply chain stages through optimal lot sizing. Setup cost, production cost, inspection cost, rejection cost, interest and depreciation cost, holding cost, etc. are considered for each supply chain stage whereas the demand inputs in the costs are taken from an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system generated forecasting method. Later, a genetic algorithm has been applied to find the optimum lot size at multiple levels of supply chain network to minimize total cost. Optimal lot size, reliability and total cost are determined and the costs are accumulated to determine total minimum supply chain cost. To validate the model, a comparison with the current situation clearly indicates the superiority of proposed model over the usual company approach to ordering policy. © 2014 International Society of Management Science and Engineering Management.},

abstract={Due to its complexity, sterilization has been perceived by some professionals who lack sterility assurance expertise as a “black box” process. Historically, medical device manufacturers have selected one of the available industrial sterilization options: dry heat, moist heat, gamma, or ethylene oxide (EO). The preselection of a sterilization modality (method) typically is made without understanding its impact based on qualified sterilization processes for existing products, capability, or resources required for the specific processes. Early engagement with sterilization subject matter experts (SMEs) can redirect the decision to preselect a legacy modality and help foster innovation and operational agility. Recent focus on supply chain flexibility and sustainability by the medical device industry has been affected by concerns surrounding cobalt-60 shortages and EO emissions. These factors drive the need for early involvement with sterility assurance SMEs in the product development process and the exploration of multiple sterilization modalities. This article highlights the importance of exploring multiple sterilization modalities during the product development stage to support sustainable business continuity plans. © 2020 Allen Press Inc..

abstract={This paper investigates inbound logistics for an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing) manufacturer, who aims at short production time and JIT policy. In such a case, it can be argued that the inbound vehicle routing schedule should be combined with incoming parts inventory control. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous control method of combining vehicle scheduling and inventory control for such dynamic inbound logistics. For the transportation control, a vehicle routing system, in which delivery jobs are made with shipments of one supplier, is proposed to generate a vehicle routes plan by considering production start time, travel time, waiting time, and loading/unloading time. To evaluate the performance of the generated vehicle routing plan, a goal model is also developed by considering vehicle operating cost, stock level exceeding penalty, and transportation efficiency. A generated vehicle routing plan can be rejected when the stock level is over the capacity and an appropriate number of vehicles for its manufacturing environment can be determined. Using real data from an LCD firm, a simulation study is conducted. The simulation results indicate that the simultaneous control approach requires fewer vehicles than the existing system and shows better efficiency of transportation. This method can also be used to determine the appropriate incoming part inventory level or the number of vehicles required in dynamic inbound logistics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Supply chain integration (SCI) and reconfiguration (SCR) are two primary approaches in recent supply chain management. However, their conflicting mechanisms and axioms have engendered two branches of research. This study, based on the concept of ambidexterity, argues that pursuing SCI and SCR simultaneously as the ambidextrous management of supply chain (AMSC) is key to manufacturers to gain superior performance. Based on the dynamic capabilities view (DCV), this paper identities data analysis capability and organizational mindfulness as important drivers of the AMSC. Based on 333 samples of Taiwanese manufacturing firms, our findings demonstrate that the AMSC has a positive effect on the manufacturer performance. Data analysis capability and organizational mindfulness can support a manufacturing firm to sense environment and to facilitate the AMSC. Although research on SCI and SCR has advanced over the past years, less studies reconcile such two contradicting approaches. By considering SCI and SCR depth in terms of their mechanisms and axioms, this study clarifies the relationship between SCI and SCR and shows their effects on the manufacturer performance. Furthermore, this study extends the DCV by showing that data analysis capability and organizational mindfulness are key to foster dynamic capabilities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In today's turbulent environment, competitive pressures and market unpredictability have dramatically lashed business profits. Agility is an essential ability for firms facing such an environment. However, coping with the hostile business environment requires not only the agility from individual firms but also the collaboration from their supply chain partners. Supply chain agility (SCA) therefore is vital to the competitiveness and performance of a firm and its supply chain partners. Exploring how to effectively enable SCA is significant for both practice and theory development. Recently, firms are increasingly relying on integrated information systems and analytical tools, such as business intelligent systems, and close collaboration with their supplier chain partners to enhance their responsiveness. This paper seeks to broaden the understanding about the enabling roles of IOS integration, analytical ability of inter-organizational information systems (IOS), and supply chain flexibility on SCA based on the dynamic capabilities view and real options theory. With a sample of 147 matched-pair data gathered from the top 2000 Taiwanese manufacturing firms, our results support the effect of IOS integration on supply chain flexibility, including offering and sourcing flexibilities, which in turn facilitate SCA. We also propose and show the moderating effect of analytical ability of IOS on the process of enabling SCA. These results contribute to a better understanding of how SCA may be achieved in theory and in practice. The model and findings of this study should be able to serve as a basis for future research for studying SCA.},

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to test the hypotheses with SPSS (16.0) and AMOS (5.0). Findings: The results confirmed the importance of implementing environmental SC practices to sustain organizations' competitive advantage and performance. Increased SC flexibility helped reduce resources, through decreased cost factors and improved output.

abstract={Manufacturing enterprises are becoming globally distributed production systems. Rigid supply chains are giving way to dynamic supply networks that are cost-efficient and can respond to change quickly. A key factor in the formation of dynamic supply networks is the communication of manufacturing capabilities-both production capabilities and information processing capabilities. These are collectively referred to as manufacturing service capability (MSC) information. Presently, MSC information is provided using many different, proprietary terminologies and representations. The lack of a standard model impedes communications of MSC information. We propose the development of a standard MSC model to enhance the MSC information communications. This paper motives such development by presenting a use case analysis that illustrates the current and a desirable future state of MSC information communication. The future state, which relies on a standard MSC model can advance the current practice and allow precise and computer-interpretable representation of MSC information.

abstract={E-commerce, based in the 4th industrial revolution to respond to environmental changes such as rapid technical development, increasing global competition, and diverse customer needs, is accelerating while uncertainty in the business environment grows more severe. In order to effectively respond to this uncertain business environment, individual companies and parts of supply chains need flexibility, and this need for dynamic flexibility is growing as uncertainty increases. In this study, we tested our hypothesis using structural equation model analysis to verify the structural relationship between dynamic capability and business performance in the smart supply chain environment of Korean small and medium manufacturers. We confirmed through this that dynamic capability and environmental uncertainty in a smart supply chain environment have a partially significant effect on business performance and that manufacturers must strive to implement direct, systematic policies and improve dynamic capability to respond to an uncertain business environment. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Supply chain risk analysis is an important field in operations management and logistics. Identifying those risks, assessing the probability of those risks, and understanding how those risks change if mitigation strategies are implemented contribute to better supply chain risk management. Reliability analysis has a long tradition of assessing the probability of failure, and fault trees are typically used to understand how the failure of individual components can lead to system failure within an engineered system. More recently, fault trees have been proposed to assess the probability of a supply chain failure. Dynamic fault trees, which are relatively new in reliability analysis, model the dependency among possible component failure and how these probabilities change over time. This paper applies dynamic fault trees to model supply chain risk for different types of supply chains. The dynamic fault tree allows a firm to model complex interactions among suppliers and understand how those interactions impact its risk. The model incorporates an information system that relays information about the status of suppliers to the firm, and this information system could also fail. A Markov chain model and Monte Carlo simulation are used to numerically assess supply chain risk as modeled by these dynamic fault trees. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Fashion consumers are constantly demanding more variety of designs, better quality and service, including both reliability and faster delivery. The achievement of these objectives implies new relations, innovative processes and new modes of evaluation between supply chain stakeholders. These pressures have prompted academics and industrial leaders to investigate new methods in order to achieve effectiveness across the fashion supply chain. As such, the concepts of agile supply chain, flexible systems, and quick response have emerged and have been adopted in several ways in the industry. Despite their recognition, these concepts are often confused in the literature. To avoid those issues, this paper aims at proposing a formal analysis framework, called ASO, for conducting a literature review of the agility initiatives and models developed for the fashion industry. The proposed framework identifies key dimensions in terms of action levers related to supply chain agility, scope of improvement initiatives, and targeted objectives.

abstract={Background: A vital determinant of supply chain performance is its adaptability. It is one of essential features that affect the results of the functioning of a supply chain. Many researchers indicate adaptability as a significant source of acquiring and maintaining a long-term competitive advantage, one of major factors that guarantee the success of a supply chain, or a major development megatrend of supply chains. The main objective of the article is to analyse the impact of such factors as industry and applied competitive strategy (cost leadership, differentiation, or focus) on the level of supply chain performance and results achieved by the supply chain with regard to the key aspects of performance in the context of adaptability. Methods: In the article the author analyses results of studies conducted with CATI method at a sample of 200 enterprises representing four industries: automotive, food, furniture as well as consumer electronics and household appliances, which are among most advanced sectors in the Polish economy (leaders of Polish export). The analysis of data gathered was carried out at a few stages. Firstly, a hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis was applied. The developed model was used for measuring and assessing the performance of supply chains and its dimensions by means of designating factor scores. The last stage involved studying the impact of such factors as type of industry or applied competitive strategy on the level of performance and its four dimensions: visibility, velocity, versatility, and responsiveness. At this stage the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Results: The results of the conducted studies provided evidence that the level of supply chain performance as well as its four dimensions is not affected by the type of industry, but vary in accordance to the applied competitive strategy. Conclusions: The model, developed and positively verified in terms of quality, may constitute a useful tool for management practitioners to measure and assesses the performance of specific supply chains, as well as make comparisons between them. Thanks to determining factors that affect the level of performance and its four dimensions, managers may as well consciously indicate directions in improving supply chains. ©Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska.},

abstract={Over the last decades, supply chains have become more complex by growing the number of participants, forming supply alliances that stretch over larger distances across the globe, and increasing the frequency and complexity of the interaction among members. As these chains interweaved, they gave rise to a new, more complex and dynamic structure: supply networks. The emergence of interrelating, multi-organization supply networks (with competing or non-competing goals) created the need for new approaches to supply network management. Recent advances in supply decision networks and collaboration applied to production line control offer new opportunities to develop a novel operational management methodology. This paper explores the combination of CRP Physical and CEP Chemical dimensions with insights gained from Collaborative Production Line Control to create a new supply network management methodology. The new methodology is compared to traditional supply chain management methods and its advantages are presented.},

abstract={The term “Agri-Food 4.0” is an analogy to the term "Industry 4.0", coming from the concept “agriculture 4.0”. Since the origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand the future paths of the Agri-Food domain. © 2020},

The dynamic supply chain means the retailer can change his suppliers in every purchase period for more profits. Four categories of two-stage supply chain structures consisting of multiple suppliers and a single retailer are considered. Two categories of auction mechanisms, single-winner or multi-winner auction, are used in this paper. A multi-agent model is developed to study these four categories of supply chains. The results of experiments show that, with the decrease of safety stock, the tendencies of the retailer's profit are changed under different structures. Also, the optimal (near-optimal) safety stock, corresponding to the maximum profit, shows significant difference under different structures. The results of this paper demonstrate that the safety stock can be significantly changed and financial benefits can be achieved while working under different supply chain structures with (T, S) strategy. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract={Supplier evaluation is of great significance in green supply chain management. Influenced by factors such as economic globalization, sustainable development, a holistic index framework is difficult to establish in green supply chain. Furthermore, the initial index values of candidate suppliers are often characterized by uncertainty and incompleteness and the index weight is variable. To solve these problems, an index framework is established after comprehensive consideration of the major factors. Then an adaptive weight D-S theory model is put forward, and a fuzzy-rough-sets-AHP method is proposed to solve the adaptive weight in the index framework. The case study and the comparison with TOPSIS show that the adaptive weight D-S theory model in this paper is feasible and effective. © 2019 KIPS.},

abstract={The multi-products dynamic pricing problem based on manufacturer was studied, in which the demand of purchasers was uncertain. The cost of the raw-material, production of multi-products, the stock and the cost of executing order from downstream enterprise were considered, the unsatisfied demand and the lead time in delivering were taken into account either. The time-space network was introduced to describe this dynamic supply chain network, by which the mathematical model for dynamic pricing that make manufacturers get the biggest profit was established. Finally, a numerical example was analyzed to prove the rationality of this model. The optimal price, output and stock from the numerical example can provide manufacturers with subsidiary decision-making to formulate reasonable production plan. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We consider a decentralized two-period supply chain in which a manufacturer produces a product with benefits of cost learning, and sells it through a retailer facing a price-dependent demand. The manufacturer's second-period production cost declines linearly in the first-period production, but with a random learning rate. The manufacturer may or may not have the inventory carryover option. We formulate the resulting problems as two-period Stackelberg games and obtain their feedback equilibrium solutions explicitly. We then examine the impact of mean learning rate and learning rate variability on the pricing strategies of the channel members, on the manufacturer's production decisions, and on the retailer's procurement decisions. We show that as the mean learning rate or the learning rate variability increases, the traditional double marginalization problem becomes more severe, leading to greater efficiency loss in the channel. We obtain revenue sharing contracts that can coordinate the dynamic supply chain. In particular, when the manufacturer may hold inventory, we identify two major drivers for inventory carryover: market growth and learning rate variability. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our results by examining a model in which cost learning takes place continuously. © 2014 Production and Operations Management Society.},

abstract={Purpose: In light of the sustainable diet debate, we conducted a large-scale regionalised LCA to answer the following questions: (i) does the climate advantage hypothesis of plant-based fat spreads and creams over dairy butter and cream hold regardless of the variabilities of product recipes, geographies and the influence of land use change (LUC)? (ii) Considering the climate-water-land nexus, is there a risk of shifting impacts from climate to water scarcity and land occupation, and what are the key opportunities for impact mitigation? Methods: A framework for conducting a large-scale regionalised LCA was developed and applied to compare the environmental impacts of 212 plant-based fat spreads, 16 plant-based creams and 40 dairy alternatives sold in 21 countries per 1 kg of product. Data was compiled for different product recipes, key ingredient sourcing countries, production factory locations, energy mixes, packaging designs, transportation and end-of-life scenarios. Spatially (archetype) differentiated agricultural life cycle inventory data were generated, as well as LUC emissions for agricultural ingredients. A total of 18 environmental indicators were assessed. Results and discussion: All plant-based spreads had a significantly lower climate impact than butter, with and without LUC inclusion. The regionalised analysis highlighted large variabilities across products, ranging from 0.98 to 6.93 (mean 3.3) kg CO2-eq for 212 plant-based spreads and 8.08 to 16.93 (mean 12.1) kg CO2-eq for 21 dairy butter with 95th confidence interval. The main drivers of GHG emissions for plant-based products are oilseed farming and the associated LUC emissions, which can vary significantly depending on type of oilseeds, quantity and sourcing country; in the worst-case scenario, the climate advantage is no longer valid due to LUC. Thus, the inclusion of LUC is essential for a robust assessment and hotspot identification. Overall, the risk of shifting impact was small, as most of the plant-based spreads also had lower impacts for water scarcity footprints and land occupation; 8 of the 212 products were not lower, due to oilseed ingredients with high embodied impacts. Conclusions: This study confirmed that plant-based spreads had lower climate, water and land impacts than butter, despite variability of product recipes, geographies and influence of LUC. This research offers a framework for performing regionalised agricultural LCA for a large portfolio of products thereby enabling identification of inter-product variabilities and hotspots for the development of mitigation strategies. Key mitigation opportunities include reducing oilseed ingredients’ embodied impacts by optimising product recipe design and adapting supply chain sourcing and agricultural practice. © 2020, The Author(s).},

This study puts forth an empirically supported integrative framework to understand supply chain flexibility from market-oriented and network-oriented perspectives, interrelationships among its dimensions and the effect of supply chain complexity as a contingent factor. Design/methodology/approach: The online survey data were collected from 201 manufacturing companies and checked for common method variance, validity and reliability. Structural equation modeling was then used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results of this study demonstrate that there are interrelationships among market-oriented and network-oriented supply chain flexibility dimensions. It is the flexibility embedded in the supply chain network configuration that plays critical roles in superior performance in flexibility capabilities to create customer values. The interrelated effect among flexibility dimensions is contingent on the magnitude of the supply chain complexity corresponding to the number of supply chain tiers. Originality/value: This study takes a step to advance understanding of supply chain flexibility from an integrative point of view consisting of market-oriented and network-oriented perspectives. This study is expected to provide practitioners the foundation to implement supply chain flexibility considering the interrelationships among flexibility dimensions. Our results suggest that to carry out a supply chain flexibility strategy, the vertical complexity of the supply chain structure needs to be taken into consideration. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: From the perspective of the economic theory of complementarity, the purpose of this paper is to examine how internal collaboration and external competencies would provoke and strengthen each other, and subsequently enhance organizational innovation capability. Design/methodology/approach: The survey data were collected from 201 manufacturing firms and checked for common method variance, validity and reliability. Structural equation modeling was then used to test the hypothetical complementarity effect. Findings: The results suggest that internal collaboration (as a manifestation of exploitative learning) and external competencies, which include supply network flexibility and supplier operational capabilities (as manifestation of exploratory learning), do in fact compensate for each other’s deficiencies. Complementary deployment of internal collaboration and external competencies enhances each other’s contribution to innovation capability. Practically, the study indicates that organizations should consider making concerted efforts to develop internal collaboration, supply network flexibility and supplier operational capability as a bundle. Originality/value: Extensive discussions exist in the literature on exploration and exploitation being essential components of innovation and their conflicting impact on innovation efficiency and effectiveness. But how an organization should operationally develop supply chain competencies in order to maximize overall innovation capability still remains largely an unanswered question. The current study advances the research on the inter-relationships between exploration and exploitation by empirically demonstrating the complementary nature of internal collaboration and external competencies in developing sustainable innovation capabilities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It is one of a select few papers that explores the effect of both internal capability and external knowledge on innovation flexibility, and discusses both supply chain and human resource development implications. Results indicate that supply chain network flexibility and information spanning flexibility play a mediating role between EKA and product innovation flexibility (PIF), illustrating the importance of flexible supply chain networks and information distribution structures in facilitating the transformation of external knowledge into innovation. The study provides further evidence that strong OA allows firms to leverage external knowledge and supply chain network capability to influence PIF and performance. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Strategic supply chain design decisions are critical to the long-term success of a business. Traditional facility location models for supply chain design focus on the tradeoffs between the costs and benefits of proximity, i.e., the distance between facilities and customers. These strategic-focused models do not consider the supply chain's agility, i.e., its ability to quickly respond to unexpected fluctuations in customer needs. In this paper, we study the problem of designing a supply chain distribution network under demand uncertainty and analyze how the optimal design characteristics of proximity and agility depend on various input parameters. We are able to draw managerial insights on how agility considerations may invalidate well-established and widely accepted qualitative results derived from traditional models. In particular,we showthat it is optimal to increase the density of distribution centers (DCs) when the shortage penalty cost increases, and to decrease the density of DCs when a certain unit transportation cost parameter increases. Through these findings, our work conveys the message that traditional, proximity-based facility location models can be inadequate for designing modern responsive supply chains, and calls for the need to develop a new class of models for the task. © 2016 INFORMS.},

abstract={Developing a flexible supply chain is important for enterprises to face market volatility and diversity. In order to satisfy order requirements under demand uncertainty, this study constructs a coordinated production planning model of supply chain networks considering production capacity expansion. Besides, the proposed model involves batch production that is commonly used in many companies. The constructed model is then linearised as a mixed-integer linear programming problem to guarantee global optimality. The solution of the reformulated model determines the optimal production, transportation and inventory levels as well as the optimal batch production operations and capacity expansion strategy. Several numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the impacts of production capacity expansion on the operations of the supply chain.

abstract={To produce 16 billion gallons of ethanol from cellulosic feedstocks by 2022, the biomass based ethanol industry will undergo significant changes in biomass supply and ethanol demand as compared to the current situation where few commercial facilities are operating. Strategic level decisions such as timings, locations, and capacities of facilities within the system will be critical for the success of the cellulosic based ethanol industry. These decisions will be impacted by biomass availability, production costs, and accessibility to transportation infrastructure. A multi-stage biomass supply chain optimization model was developed to answer these systems level questions. The model minimized the total ethanol production costs throughout the planning period (2012-2022) given the projected changes of biomass supply and ethanol demand. It was assumed that a planning decision should be made each year during the planning period. The decisions include the optimal installation timings, locations, and capacities of building new facilities and/or expanding the existing facilities, as well as the optimal biomass flow patterns between facilities within the system. The results of the optimal supply chain configuration suggest building large biorefineries with the support of many small/medium centralized storage and preprocessing facilities. The average Miscanthus-ethanol production costs are $0.66 L-1.},

abstract={This paper proposes an optimal dispatch model of an integrated energy system (IES), with carbon trading and flexible loads (FLs) considered. First, the carbon trading is introduced into the dispatch model, taking into account the carbon emissions of the entire energy supply chain. Next, flexible loads are divided into three categories, i.e. curtailable, transferable and shiftable ones, which are respectively modeled in detail. On this basis, electric network constraints, natural gas network constraints, together with internal constraints of energy hubs (EHs) are integrated into the low-carbon economic dispatch model with an objective of minimizing the operation costs including the carbon trading cost, flexible loads dispatching cost and system energy cost. Finally, an integrated energy system including 9 energy hubs is employed to demonstrate the proposed model, together with detailed analysis about the impacts of the carbon trading price and FLs on the IES. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={To fight climate change, firms must adopt effective and feasible carbon management practices that promote collaboration within supply chains. Engaging suppliers and customers on carbon management reduces vulnerability to climate-related risks and increases resilience and adaptability in supply chains. Therefore, it is important to understand the motives and preconditions for pursuing supply chain engagement from companies that actively engage with supply chain members in carbon management. In this study, a relational view is applied to operationalize the supply chain engagement concept to reflect the different levels of supplier and customer engagement. Based on a sample of 345 companies from the Carbon Disclosure Project’s supply chain program, the determinants of engagement were hypothesized and tested using multinomial and ordinal logistic estimation methods. The results indicate that companies that integrate climate change into their strategies and are involved in developing environmental public policy are driven by moral motives to engage their suppliers and customers in carbon management. All these factors make a stronger impact on supplier engagement than on customer engagement. Moreover, companies operating in greenhouse gas-intensive industries are driven by instrumental motives to engage their suppliers and customers because increasing greenhouse gas intensity positively influences engagement level. Company profitability appears to increase supplier engagement, but not customer engagement. Interestingly, operating in a country with stringent environmental regulations does not appear to influence supply chain engagement. By utilizing relational capabilities and collaboration, buyers can increase their suppliers’ engagement to disclose emissions, which ultimately will lead to better results in carbon management. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper investigates a dynamic supply chain model in which a supplier decides both the wholesale price and the green process innovation investments while a manufacturer sets the retail price. We refer to Industry 4.0 technologies like Robotics, Automated Guided Vehicles and 3D printing, which allow firms to reduce the amount of resources wasted and the emissions, generating an overall environmental benefit as well as a reduction of the marginal production cost. The environmental performance positively influences the demand, which leads to larger production volume and in turn damages the environmental performance via negative externalities (e.g., emissions). We resolve this operational trade-off and compare an uncoordinated setting to a revenue sharing contract complemented by a collaborative program. We show that the overall benefit of environmental cooperation in green process innovation entails the existence of a profit-Pareto-improving region. Nevertheless, the maximum environmental performance fails to occur in the profit-Pareto-improving region, which shows the mismatch between economic and environmental performance. Moreover, a wholesale price contract might help to enhance environmental performance while supply chains might prefer a revenue sharing contract or vertical integrated chain to maximize profits. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Optimization of supply chain integration (SCI) is a key issue for traditional service firms which are seeking transition towards service mass customization (SMC). However, conventional research disregards the characteristics of SMC and the dynamic nature of SCI optimization triggered by the service firm's renewals of its strategy and operational decisions in the transition process. To address this challenge effectively, this study firstly proposes a resource evaluation method from a dynamic and integration process-oriented perspective. It then elaborates the impacts of service firm's strategic renewals, as well as the operational decisions, namely the resource scheduling decisions, on the evolution of the resource's integration value. On this basis, it illustrates the mechanism of the dynamic SCI optimization in SMC, and further designs a novel SCI optimization model along with a corresponding genetic algorithm. In particular, tradeoff between customized demands and scale effects, which is the paradox of SMC, is regarded as an essential optimization objective besides SCI performance. The feasibility and validity of the model and algorithm are verified by applying them to a numerical example. By incorporating the perspective of service operations, strategic change and the methodology of operations research, this study contributes to the literature of SCI in SMC by developing a dynamic resource evaluation method and a novel optimization model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The optimal coordination strategy is achieved when the dynamic supply chain profit is maximized. The profit of dynamical supply chain is decided by the corresponding effort level of each node enterprise. This paper presents a cooperative stochastic differential game model to research the optimal coordination strategy of a dynamic supply chain under uncertain conditions and studies how to coordinate the effort level of node enterprise to maximize supply chain profit. For this purpose, a cooperative stochastic differential game model of the enterprises’ effort level is constructed, and the optimal solution of the model is solved by converting it to the solution of the equivalent stochastic partial differential equation. As a result, the optimal strategy of a local node enterprise is achieved. Considering the gap between the independent decision of each node enterprise and the optimal decision of the supply chain system, the coordination mechanisms of the dynamic supply chain, including the temporary static allocation mechanism and the compensation mechanism, are given to narrow the gap to achieve the optimal coordination strategy under uncertain conditions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The manufacturer decides the product quality and wholesale price, while the retailer sets the retail price in the presence of a revenue-sharing contract and consumers reference quality effects. The objective of this study is to investigate the impacts of myopic behaviour regarding the reference quality on the product quality and pricing strategies and profits of both members. Our results suggest that the manufacturers myopia leads to a higher quality, higher price strategy and a higher quality-price ratio which benefits consumers. Meanwhile, relative to the far-sighted behaviour, myopia results in a more quality-sensitive but less price-sensitive market demand. Whats more, we find that the manufacturer is apt to act in a far-sighted way, but the retailer isnt always willing to cooperate with a far-sighted manufacturer. Taking myopic strategies for both members is likely to gain a high profit of the whole supply chain for a relatively high marginal contribution of product quality on demand and a relatively low revenue-sharing proportion. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Supply chain viability concerns the entire supply system rather than one company or one single chain to survive COVID-19 disruptions. Mobility restriction and overall demand decline lead to systematically cascading disruptions that are more severe and longer lasting than those caused by natural disasters and political conflicts. In the present study, the authors find that large companies and manufacturers with traditional advantages suffer greater losses than small ones, which is conceptualized as the “Hub Paradox” by empirically investigating one Warp Knitting Industrial Zone of China. An underload cascading failure model is employed to simulate supply chain viability under disruptions. Numerical simulations demonstrate that when the load decreases beyond a threshold, the viability will drop down critically. Besides, supply chain viability depends on two aspects: the adaptive capability of the manufacturers themselves and the adaptive capability of the connections of the supply network. The comparison study demonstrates that enhancing cooperative relations between hub and non-hub manufacturers will facilitate the entire supply network viability. The present study sheds light on viable supply chain management. Compared with conventionally linear or resilient supply chains, intertwined supply networks can leverage viability with higher adaptation of redistributing production capacities among manufacturers to re-establish overall scale advantages. Finally, the present study also suggests solving the “Hub Paradox” from the perspective of complex adaptive system. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={As off-shore prefabrication continues to gain momentum, supply chain management becomes increasingly complex for industrial modular construction projects and delays commonly occur to prefabricated modules. In order to make efficient utilization of limited module assembly resources (e.g., crews and bays) and reduce the waiting waste of materials on the module yard, a systematic optimization approach is desired to derive an optimal module assembly plan in coping with the dynamic supply chain and limited resource availability. By synthesizing information from the logistics management system, contract documents, and resources availability, a constraint programming based optimization algorithm is proposed. A case project abstracted from a real project is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimization approach. The information on module assembly start time, duration, and expected delivery time is generated to guide operations on the module yard. The minimum of total waiting time of materials on the module yard is derived for decision-making support. In conclusion, the proposed methodology seamlessly integrates principles of lean construction and constraints of resource scheduling into a constraint programming optimization formulation. This research potentially lends effective decision support to both crew work planning and materials logistical planning, ultimately leading to improvement on both construction productivity and logistical efficiency.},

abstract={Along with global geopolitical complex, information network security issues and increased natural disasters, risk management should be well considered in the construction material industry to re-integrate and establish stiff and flexible supply chains in order to cope with emergencies in the future market. Taking the construction material industry in Taiwan as the research object, representative enterprises with artificial intelligence applied sustainable supply chain management are studied. With the Delphi method and data envelopment analysis, the public data of annual statistics reports of the enterprises are used for selecting the performance indicators of inputs and outputs. Empirical data analysis is also performed to provide reference for the improvement. The research results are summarized as follows. 1. Substituting various input/output index values into CCR and BCC models, the overall production efficiency and pure technical efficiency of enterprises are calculated; by dividing the two, the returns to scale of enterprises are acquired. 2. Critical factors in artificial intelligence applied sustainable supply chain management could be found out through sensitivity analysis. Using the rate of sensitivity change as the evaluation baseline, sensitive factors contain financial aspect, scale aspect, financial performance, and profit before tax. Finally, discussions are proposed according to the results, expecting to help domestic businesses in the construction material industry establish steady and flexible supply chains and present diversified procurement sources to reinforce the emergency defensive ability of the construction material industry. © 2021 by the authors.

By introducing an interval-like time-varying delayed state signal to predict the order variations of downstream sites and taking into account the parametric perturbations, the dynamic supply chain is modeled as an uncertain linear discrete-time system with interval-like time-delay. Then, output feedback control scheme is proposed to improve the performance of the supply chain system. A sufficient condition to the existence of the output feedback controller is derived. It is found from simulation results that the designed output feedback controller can effectively stabilize the supply chain system with interval-like time-delay and parametric perturbations.

abstract={With business environment becoming increasingly turbulent and competitive, firms are encouraged to enhance the agility capability across the supply chain in response. However, when it comes to supply chain agility, most studies only take supply chain flexibility into account. In fact, supply chain visibility is also an important indicator for supply chain agility. Furthermore, supply chain complexity is increased by more and more factors, but the influence of supply chain complexity on the relationship between ICT usage and supply chain agility has gained little attention in academic literature. This paper hypothesizes that supply chain complexity acts as a moderator between ICT usage and supply chain agility. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The aim of this article is to develop a construction supply chain-based (CSC) material supply model to enable project participants to control the operational cost under a certain environment. Cost reductions are considered as the fundamental objectives for overall CSC improvement. CSC-based purchasing requires a dynamic purchasing plan which includes long-term capital asset procurement. So, the financial impacts are also considered. Another objective is to control the delayed quantity during the supply process. Further, the viability and operational integrity is ensured by the establishment of a real resources limitation. Then, a new hybrid simulated annealing particle swarm optimisation algorithm is applied to solve the model. Finally, a practical application case in China was studied to examine the efficiency of the proposed model. By controlling the information, material and capital flow, construction period and cost can be aligned with the uncertain environment and the limited resource conditions.

abstract={Supply chain resilience is the key for cross-border e-commerce enterprises to continuously obtain competitive advantages. This paper studies the influencing factors of cross-border e-commerce supply chain resilience (CBSCR), so as to further enhance the competitiveness of global supply chain and ensure the safe operation of cross-border e-commerce supply chain. Based on the ternary theory of supply chain resilience, this paper firstly constructs the CBSCR influencing factor system, and then analyzes the comprehensive influence degree, causal relationship and logical hierarchy among the influencing factors by using the fuzzy DEMATEL-ISM method. The results show that: recovery speed of supply chain disruption, response time of supply chain disruption, coordination ability among cross border e-commerce partners, experience sharing among cross-border e-commerce partners, joint planning among cross-border e-commerce partners, establish a good enterprise reputation for fairness, risk management team among partners, and develop a collaborative culture among partners are the key influencing factors of CBSCR. On this basis, it is proposed that the adaptability of supply chain is a top priority, which can be started from strengthening risk management culture, cooperation among partners and construction of supply chain agility. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the networking of physical items through the use of embedded sensors and other devices that gather and convey information about the items. The data collected from these devices can be used to optimize products, services, and operations. One of the earliest and best-known applications of such technology appears in the area of energy optimization: sensors deployed across the electricity grid can help utilities remotely monitor energy usage and make responses to account for peak times and downtimes. The IoT is also widely used in manufacturing enterprises to optimize production. For example, in factories, sensors enhance production efficiency by providing a constant flow of data to optimize production processes. The data collected from equipment can be used to determine the operating state of the equipment. This can greatly improve the accuracy of the equipment maintenance plan, reduce maintenance costs, and reduce unplanned downtime.

By conducting an exploratory case study with three automakers, it is found that different GO strategies require the support of different SCF dimensions. More importantly, the magnitude of the role played by each flexibility dimension varies depending on the degree of innovativeness in the green design initiatives, the types of green purchasing initiatives, and the strategic orientation of green manufacturing initiatives being adopted. Our case studies contribute to the theoretical understanding of the complex SCF-GO relationship by identifying the essential theoretical constructs and indicating their lower layer interactions in a systematic way. In practice, our findings may help managers assess which SCF dimensions can contribute more significantly to their specific GO efforts, and then strategically plan, develop, and deploy relevant flexibility to support beneficial outcomes. Our study contributes to the OM literature by clarifying the multidimensional effects of SCF on GO. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

More importantly, it examines whether this relationship between SCCs and GO is contingent on corporate environmental proactivity (EP). Theoretical predictions of the conceptual model were tested using hierarchical regression analyses of data obtained from 225 senior logistics/supply chain managers in the global auto sector. To ensure the robustness of our findings, a post-hoc analysis using the partial least squares approach was conducted. Significant positive associations exist between specific SCCs and the adoption of GO strategies. EP positively moderates the external integration capability – green purchasing and the supplier appraisal capability – green manufacturing linkages. However, unexpectedly, EP negatively moderates the effect of internal integration capability on green purchasing. Equally surprising, consistent negative moderation effects are detected for supply chain flexibility on green design, green purchasing, and green manufacturing. This study contributes to the existing resource-based view literature by focusing on the capability – strategy linkage and its specific application to environmental management. The exploration of the moderating effects of EP confirms the important role of organizing context in the effective exploitation and deployment of resources and capabilities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the specific role of supply chain capabilities (SCCs) in the implementation of particular green strategies and the extent to which this relationship is contingent upon firm size. Design/methodology/approach – A survey-based approach was used to empirically test the study hypotheses. Data that were collected from 225 senior logistics/supply chain managers across the automotive OEM and supplier base (predominantly from China, North America and Europe) were analyzed using moderated regression analyses. Findings – SCCs contribute to effective green strategy implementation and their magnitude varies significantly with respect to green design, green purchasing and green manufacturing. Firm size has positive moderating effects on supply chain flexibility in both green design and green purchasing, and on supplier appraisal capability in both green purchasing and green manufacturing. However, unexpectedly, firm size negatively moderates not only supply chain management (SCM) skills/knowledge in both green design and green purchasing but also IT/IS support in green manufacturing. Research limitations/implications – This paper adopted a cross-sectional survey design and was only conducted in the automotive industry which may affect the inferences of causality and generalizability beyond this sector. Practical implications – Managers should consider whether the green strategies that they want to follow “fit” with their existing resources/capabilities and firm-level conditions, and accordingly develop and deploy appropriate SSCs for successful implementation. Originality/value – The research contributes to the existing resource-based view literature by studying the capability–strategy link with its specific application to environmental management. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a multitiered dynamic supply chain network equilibrium modeling framework in which the decision-makers have sufficient information about the future and seek to determine their optimal plans that maximize their profits over the multiperiod planning horizon. We construct the finite-dimensional variational inequality governing the equilibrium of the multiperiod competitive supply chain network. The model allows us to investigate the interplay of the heterogeneous decision-makers in the supply chain in a dynamic setting, and to compute the resultant equilibrium pattern of product outputs, transactions, inventories, and product prices. We then establish the supernetwork equivalence of the multiperiod supply chain model with a properly configured transportation network, which provides a new interpretation of the equilibrium conditions of the former in terms of paths and path flows. This framework offers great modeling flexibility so that, for example, transportation delay and/or perishable products can be easily handled, as we also demonstrate. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate how such multiperiod supply chain problems can be reformulated and solved as transportation network equilibrium problems in practice. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Agent-based distributed simulation is an efficient methodology for modelling and analysing such complex adaptive systems as dynamic supply chain networks. However, it lacks an acceptable generic standard. Supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model is a cross-functional framework widely accepted as an industry standard. It provides the standard processes, performance metrics, best practices and associated software functionalities for modelling, evaluating and improving supply chain networks. However, it is a static tool. Integration of agent-based distributed simulation and SCOR model can exploit their advantages to form a generic methodology for modelling and simulation of a wide range of supply chain networks. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology for distributed supply chain network modelling and simulation by means of integration of agent-based distributed simulation and an improved SCOR model. The methodology contains two components: a hierarchical framework for modelling supply chain network based on the improved SCOR model and agent building blocks integrating the standard processes from the SCOR model. The hierarchical framework provides an approach for structure modelling in any level with different granularities based on the improved SCOR model, and allows rapidly mapping a supply chain network into the structure model of a multi-agent system; while agent building blocks are quite useful and convenient to fill the structure model to fulfil its function modelling. With the approach of structure modelling and function filling, not only can the process of agent-based supply chain network modelling be accelerated, but also the built models can be reused and expanded. Because the hierarchical framework is based on the conceptual framework of SCOR model and agent building blocks integrate the standard processes from SCOR model, the proposed methodology is more generic. In addition, the issues of sub-model synchronisation and data distribution management in the agent-based distributed simulation implementation are taken into consideration and the corresponding solutions for these issues are proposed. Finally, an example of a supply chain network is modelled and implemented to illustrate the proposed methodology and related solutions. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Robustness of a supply network highly depends on its structure. Although structural design methods have been proposed to create supply networks with optimal robustness, a real-life supply network can be quite different from these optimal structural designs. Meanwhile, real cases such as Thailand floods and Tohoku earthquake demonstrate the vulnerability of supply networks in real life. Obviously, it is urgent to enhance the robustness of existing real-life supply networks. Thus, in this paper, a supply network reconfiguration method based on adaptive variable neighborhood search (AVNS) is proposed to enhance the structural robustness of supply networks facing both random and target disruptions. Firstly, a supply network model considering the heterogeneous roles of entities is introduced. Based on the model, two robustness metrics, Rr and Rt, are proposed to describe the tolerance of supply networks facing random and target disruptions, respectively. Then, the problem of reconfiguration-based supply network robustness enhancement is described. To solve the problem effectively and efficiently, a new heuristic based on general variable neighborhood search, namely, AVNS, is proposed. Finally, a case study based on three real-life supply networks is presented to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed robustness enhancing method. © 2020 Ping Lou et al.},

abstract={Governments formulate different subsidy policies to incentivize manufacturers to pro-duce green products, and these policies may have different subsidy effects. The purpose of this study is to compare and analyze the dynamic effects of different subsidy policies to the manufacturer in a green supply chain composed of a manufacturer and a retailer. Three differential game models, considering the consumers preference, are established under three subsidy policies, and the corresponding optimal equilibrium strategies of the supply chain members are analyzed. An exam-ple is used to compare the effects of the three policies under the equal government subsidy expendi-ture. The study finds that the rankings of indexes to evaluate steady‐state subsidy effects under the different subsidy policies are time invariant, and the government can preliminarily evaluate these policies according to different subsidy goals. The rankings of indexes to evaluate phased subsidy effects under these policies are time varying. If both subsidy effects and subsidy efficiencies in steady state are taken into account, the optimal selection paths of subsidy policies in the whole period can be obtained. The subsidy effects of the same policy are amplified under the condition of equal steady‐state subsidy expenditure, but the rankings of effect indexes under the different subsidy policies are not affected. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Supply chain contracts are widely considered as useful and necessary tools to guide and restrict channel members' behaviors. Considering the effect of dynamic advertising, we investigate two distinct types of contracts between a dominant retailer and her manufacturer. One contract is a traditional wholesale price contract and the other is a consignment contract. The results show that, compared to the wholesale price contract, the consignment contract is always more desirable from the perspectives of the retailer and the entire channel and brings more consumer surplus. When the dominant retailer's advertising effort is very effective or channel members have enough patience, the dominant retailer and the manufacturer can achieve a Pareto improvement under the consignment contract; otherwise the manufacturer prefers the wholesale price contract. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={A reasonably constructed dynamic model of an urban water supply network is the building block for the operation, simulation, reconstruction, expansion and planning of a water supply network. A dynamic model of the water supply network was built in Ma'anshan City, Anhui Province, China, which could offer science-based operations for attaining high efficiency, low cost water supply networks that foster both economic and social benefits. The model was designed consisting of 3 water sources, 977 pipe sections and 863 nodes. After that, a hybrid optimization algorithm combined algorithms based on a chaos optimization algorithms (COA), a genetic algorithms (GA) and a Davidon-Fletcher-Powell (DFP) variable metric algorithm was employed for the precise verification of both the nodal flow quantity and pipeline friction coefficients. The results showed: 1) that the guaranteed rate of < 1.0 mH2O absolute error of pressure measurement was 84.62%; 2) that the guaranteed rate of <1.5 mH2O absolute error was 92.31%, and 3) that of <2.0 mH2O absolute error was 100%. For the flow quantity measurement, 1) the guaranteed rate of < 5.0 L/s absolute error was 86.67%; 2) the guaranteed rate of <10.0 L/s absolute error was 93.33%, and 3) that of <20.0 L/s absolute error was 100%. Judging from the results above, the dynamic model was proved to be of sufficient precision. Then the simulation analysis was performed on the current status and the planned operation of the water supply network in Ma'anshan City, which proved the practicability of the designed model.},

abstract={Integrating a partnership with potentially stronger suppliers is widely acknowledged as a contributor to the organizational competitiveness of a supply chain. This paper proposes an event-based model which lists the events related with all phases of cooperation with partners and puts events into a dynamic supply chain network in order to understand factors that affect supply chain partnership integration. We develop a multi-objective supply chain partnership integration problem by maximizing trustworthiness, supplier service, qualified products rate and minimizing cost, and then, apply a hybrid algorithm (PSACO) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO) that aims to effciently solve the problem. It combines the advantages of PSO with reliable global searching capability and ACO with great evolutionary ability and positive feedback. By using the actual data from 1688.com, experimental studies are carried out. The parameter optimizing of the hybrid algorithm is firstly deployed and then we compare the problem solution results of PSACO with the original PSO, ACO. By studying the partnership integration results and implementing analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis, it shows that the event based model with PSACO approach has validity and superiority over PSO and ACO, and can be served as a tool of decision making for supply chain coordination management in business. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare the effects on performance of two types of misfits (overfit vs underfit) as well as two types of fits (high-high fit vs low-low fit) between environmental uncertainty and supply chain flexibility. Design/methodology/approach - The two asymmetry hypotheses have been tested with survey data from 212 Chinese manufacturing firms. Findings - The results in general provided empirical evidences for the asymmetric effects in the fits and misfits between environmental uncertainty and supply chain flexibility. For the same degree of misfit, underfit deteriorates performance more than overfit. In addition, high supply chain flexibility fitting high environmental uncertainty (i.e. high-high fit) results in a higher performance than low supply chain flexibility fitting low environmental uncertainty (i.e. low-low fit). Practical implications - It suggests that managers should strive to avoid the underfit of supply chain flexibility rather than the overfit, if the perfect fit is impossible to achieve. In addition, as it is beneficial to realize the fit of supply chain flexibility to high levels of environmental uncertainty, managers should probably embrace the highly uncertain environment and enhance the supply chain flexibility of their organizations to meet the increasing uncertainty of environment. Originality/value - Fit and misfit are the core concepts to understand the relationships among environmental uncertainty, supply chain flexibility strategy, and performance. While the existing literature highlights the differential performance consequences of fit vs misfit between environmental uncertainty and supply chain flexibility strategy, the effects on performance are assumed to be the same for the two types of misfits, and two types of fits. The authors challenge these symmetry assumptions by arguing that overfit has a less negative effect on performance than underfit, and high-high fit has a stronger positive effect than low-low fit. The authors found empirical evidence in a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Supply chain dynamic has been drawn a lot of attention by researchers and entrepreneurs in past years. Many authors recognize that effective information sharing has a great influence on supply chain performance. As the information technology development, partners among the supply chain network are willing to work in closer relationship for the supply chain collaboration and coordination. Base on the literature which is emphasized on the individual impact of information sharing or with focus on the buying firm perspective, this research is trying to examine the individual and combined effect of information and knowledge sharing on buyer-supplier relationship and performance from supplier perspective. The conceptual framework is a path diagram consists of information sharing, knowledge sharing, buyer-supplier relationship and supplier performance. A survey instrument was developed based on extant researches and valid data was collected through face-to-face interview with 117 electronic components supplying firms. The result shows information sharing can prompt the knowledge sharing and improve the buyer-supplier relationship as well as the supplier performance. Besides, it is also demonstrated as evidence that a closer buyer-supplier relationship can enhance the supplier performance significantly. The findings presented in this study can be employed as a practical implication for electronics suppliers to understand how to improve their supply chain performance under the impact of information and knowledge sharing. © IFAC.},

abstract={Flexibility is an important indicator to consider the uncertain information processing ability of the supply chain comprehensively. It is a powerful way to improve the efficiency and quality of supply chain operation by evaluating the level of supply chain flexibility effectively. The traditional method is used to decompose the supply chain flexibility evaluation indicators from the perspective of system structure or cost saving, but these indicators cannot truly describe the dynamics of the supply chain operation. Otherwise, supply chain flexibility evaluation is a typical multiobjective evaluation; there are some incompatibilities between these flexible evaluation indicators, and the common evaluation methods are difficult to deal with such contradictions. In this paper, the dynamic characteristics of supply chain operation are considered, and the evaluation system of supply chain flexibility is designed from the perspective of operation efficiency. The matter-element analysis theory is used to create the comprehensive appraisal model of supply chain flexibility. The matter-element matrix solves the uncertainty and incompatibility of the evaluated factors used to assess supply chain flexibility. The paper evaluates the performance of four autoservice companies and concludes that the evaluation grades of the four companies are in line with the reality, indicating that the evaluation system and the method are effective and credible. © 2020 Xiaochun Luo et al.},

abstract={In this paper, two noncooperative dynamic pricing strategies are used in a supply chain. Two dynamic Stackelberg game models have been built involving both a manufacturer and a retailer assumed to be the leader in order. In the two models, the manufacturer sells national-brand (NB) product to an independent retailer or directly to consumers through a direct channel. The retailers sell a store-brand (SB) product when they sell the NB product coming from the manufacturer. Thus, there is competition both in different channels and in products with different brands. To analyze the complexity of the model, parameter bifurcation diagrams and strange attractor diagrams have been therefore plotted. The results show that the game leader has advantages when the market is stable, but it turns disadvantageous if the state falls into unstable as the game follower can quickly adjust the strategy to seize the market. The wholesale price and the direct selling price are high that they incur larger profits if the manufacturer is dominant, but it gets worse when the adjustment speed increases. While in the model where the retailer plays a dominant role, the increase in the adjustment speed is unfavorable to retailer. By controlling the total cost of the direct channel and increasing channel competition strength and brand competition strength, the manufacturers can increase their profits in the game dominated by the retailer. In addition, the stable region within the system will be narrow since the market is sensitive to the channel competition, brand competition, and advertising indifference. © 2019 Junhai Ma et al.},

As the demand is not always for sure, the supply chain follows Manufacturers Cooperating (MC) and Manufacturers Stackelberg (MS). The main objective of the paper is to investigate the influence of the decision parameters such as the after-sale investment, wholesale price adjustment speed and risk preference on the stability and utilities of the risk-averse supply chain. The dynamic phenomena, such as the bifurcation, chaos and sensitivity to initial values are analyzed with 2D-bifurcation diagrams, double largest Lyapunov exponent and basins of attraction. The study shows that the faster the adjustment speed is, the more profits the retailer can make, but on the other hand, it is no good to manufacturers. Risk tolerance levels (RM and RR) affect the utility of the manufacturers and that of the retailer differently. A feedback control method is used to control the chaos in the supply chain. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper studies a dynamic cooperative advertising under supply disruptions. Cooperative (Co-op) advertising is a widely used marketing tool which affects advertising effort policy and advertising subsidy policy throughout the supply chain. First, the manufacturer announces the participation rate of cooperative advertising which specifies the percentage of the retailer's advertising expenditure that it will provide, then the retailer determines its advertising effort policy. We model this supply chain problem as a Stackelberg differential game, and provide the optimal advertising effort policy and advertising subsidy policy for the manufacturer and the retailer. Based on a Co-op advertising scenarios, we consider the supply disruption. When a supply disruption occurs, the initial cooperative advertising policy need to be revised. To solve this problem, the change of margin of manufacturer and retailer and market scale of product caused by supply disruption must be explicitly considered. This paper discusses how to model the supply disruptions and their impacts, and how to design cooperative advertising scheme under supply disruption. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={E-commerce platform enterprises have typical bilateral market characteristics. The e-commerce platform provides real-time communication services for buyers and sellers. Different buyers and sellers form crossnetwork characteristics. The formulation and implementation of bilateral strategies affect both the merchants and consumers' choice of platform and registration transactions. This impact will directly lead to the transaction value of the platform. Then, the article builds an econometric model and empirically analyses the impact of e-commerce platforms. The e-commerce chain is a complex structure that consists of logistics, information flow, and capital flow and connects suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and users in the industry together. Blockchain technology can be used as a large-scale collaboration tool to adapt to supply chain management, the main factor that drives the market power of the enterprise. The research results show that the input costs of advertising, research and development, and employee training and the impact of long-term investment and taxation on market forces are quite different in different industries, both positive and negative, and subsidies, inventory, and state-owned holdings have a negative impact on the market power of companies in all industries.

abstract={Forecasts pertaining to urban freight transport and international freight transport in the European Union unanimously imply that, within at least the next thirty years, the main indicator of functionality and growth will be dynamic supply chains, as they are commonly referred to, where logistics centres supported by almost infinite possibilities of new e-technologies will play the most crucial part. Owing to industrial tradition and well-developed transport infrastructure, including primarily the most densely built network of high-class roads in the country and fast road connections with central Poland as well as neighboring countries, the territory of Silesian Province has become an important warehousing market of all-Polish and Central-Eastern European relevance. Identifying the trends observed in the development of freight transport logistics within the territory in question is the first step towards improvement of the current state of matters. It also provided grounds to perform one of tasks defined under the international S-mile project implemented within the framework of the ERANET Transport III "Sustainable Logistics and Supply Chain" programme. This article is mainly an attempt to review results of the analyses undertaken in this scope, including those pertaining to the specificity of the existing infrastructure and the projected development of the logistic infrastructure in Silesian Province along with orientations of its development proposed in strategic documents of both national and regional level, such as the Silesian Province development strategy, development plans, concepts, forecasts as well as projects concerning transport and freight transport logistics.

abstract={As disruptions and uncertainty have become emergent themes within the supply chain literature, attention has shifted towards the choices enacted to combat the negative effects of disruptions. Extant research highlights the importance of system states–namely robustness and resilience–towards mitigating the probability and magnitude of disruptions, however, there appears to be a lack of conceptual guidance surrounding two popular strategies–redundancy and flexibility–that have been proposed to mitigate the impact of disruptions. To address this issue, we review and investigate contextual factors from empirical research that may offer insight into conceptual strategies that can be utilised to improve post-disruption system performance utilising a methodology based upon an abductive approach to conceptual theory building. In this paper published research on resilience and robustness in supply chains is considered, alongside research in other areas such as risk, systems theory, and ecology. Inference drawn from empirical research is often highly contextualised, but collectively highlights unique generalisable factors. Our research proposes four broad conceptual strategies–insurance, expediting, strategic adaptive capability and reconfiguration–that each uniquely serve to reduce the probability and magnitude of supply chain disruptions. Our research concludes that the difference in utility between redundancy and flexibility as means to enhance resilience and robustness is influenced by interactions between the supply chain, the disruption characteristics (inclusive of speed of onset and time horizon) and the decision maker. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Distribution centers play a critical role in maintaining supply chains efficiency, flexibility, and reliability. Given the limited financial and physical resources of today's businesses, distribution enterprises have be-gun to embrace the far-reaching value of lean paradigm. Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is prescribed as a part of lean implementation portfolio of tools. It is employed to visually map value streams' material and information flows seeking to identify the sources of waste and non-value added activities. Integrating simulation with VSM introduces a whole new dimension for lean implementation and assessment processes given its ability to dynamically model systems complexity and uncertainty. This paper shows a value stream mapping-based simulation framework that is used to assess two basic lean distribution practices, pull replenishment and class-based storage policy, of a tire distribution company. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to examine how multinational companies from five industries can adapt to what we call Supply Chain 4.0; the supply chain created as a result of the new digital era brought forth by the fourth industrial revolution. The focus is limited to three key emerging trends this development is seeing; Big Data, cloud computing and 3D printing. This study is carried out through a literature review and empirical findings from a series of interviews, and an explorative survey. The literature review identified a substantial difference in compatibility between industry level and the digital transformation Supply Chain 4.0 implies. Empirical findings showed that among the investigated trends, 3D printing was considered to have a major impact on Supply Chain 4.0. Its use though has been limited due to uncertainty among the supply chain stakeholders about its true added value in a cost/benefit perspective. Moreover, multinationals showed a strong preference for Big Data implementations, but only had limited focus on cloud computing applications. This paper presents a graphical framework meant to give practitioners a better description and understanding of the issues that have been debated concerning Supply Chain 4.0, their adaptability and their strengths and challenges. © 2019, © 2019 Kedge Business School.},

abstract={The most common solutions to protect the supply chains for disruptions are increasing inventory, adding capacity, and using multiple suppliers. While these approaches in general prove to solve the disruption problem, they come with a negative effect on cost per product and cost of capital. In a highly volatile demand environment with fast pace changing technology, increasing inventory can constitute a big risk for obsolesce, hence additional measures are needed to create a competitive business advantage with such a supply chain. Furthermore, when competing about the same sources, as in the case of semiconductors, Operations Executives need to be able to respond fast when supply issues occur, in order to minimize the potential impact from a disruption. The ability to react and response to a disruption is enhanced with Supply chain risk tools utilizing the most recent technologies, such as Control Tower solutions enabling End-to End monitoring and transparency. However, even with the help of such technology, the decision maker will still be reactive and can merely respond to occurrences. To reach the next level of responsiveness, additional layer of intelligence is needed in the supply chain solution. From the available literature about Supply Chain Resilience, and similar advanced supply chain solutions, we can conclude that the main focus of research has so far been on the demand side, i.e., how to enhance forecast management. There are thus few practical and academic contributions on how to manage the supply side or more precise on how to manage the Inbound Supply Chain in a volatile business environment. The purpose of this paper is to investigate what factors that are crucial to regard when creating a proactive and responsive Inbound Supply Chain. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={Supply chain flexibility has been an important supply chain capability in providing firms the necessary alternate configurations and hence safeguarding them from disruptions. This study investigates the influence of supply and demand competence on supply chain flexibility and its influence on a firm's operational and relational performance. While the former competence refers to production and supply management-related activities, the latter refers to distribution and demand management-related activities. Within this framework, process compliance, that is, how well supply chain management processes are internally executed by the firm's employees, is observed as an enabler (moderator) on the relationship between supply chain competence and supply chain flexibility. Further, the model also explores the moderating influence of environmental uncertainty on the linkage between supply chain flexibility and firm performance. The model is empirically validated based on perceptual data collected from 163 supply chain professionals through web-based survey. Implications for both managers as well as practitioners are also provided. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose -The conceptualization of flexibility in organizations historically emerged from three views which relate to economic, to organizational and to manufacturing perspectives. Despite the growing number of publications about supply chain flexibility in the area of supply chain management, there is a lack of consensus on how to define and to conceptualize supply chain flexibility froma management point of view. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview of the literature on the supply chain flexibility perspective and contributes to our understanding of the current state of research and its future development. Design/methodology/approach -The researchmethodology used is the systematic literature review. In total 92 articles were selected from databases of well-known journal publishers in the field of economics, business studies and management sciences as well as grey literature to cover the topic of supply chain flexibility. Findings -A limited number of studies in the field of supply chain flexibility apply theories and define the term supply chain flexibility. Instead they focus on a particular part or dimension of the supply chain. Based on the analysis, a distinction is made between flexibility in the supply chain and supply chain flexibility. Based on the function and characteristics of the supply chain, the authors selected 30 flexibility dimensions that cover supply chain flexibility by concentrating on the different business areas involved. Research limitations/implications -The results support researchers and practitioners by identifying relevant trends and gaps in the field of supply chain flexibility. Originality/value -The authors review the dimensions and aspects of supply chain flexibility that are currently taken into account in the literature. In this way, the authors provide an overarching perspective on the flexibility literature relating to supply chains. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Empirical studies about supply chain flexibility have mainly focused on one (manufacturing) company, occasionally incorporating the adjoining view from a supplier, distributor, or retailer. The present paper argues that a dyadic perspective is not sufficient and that an integrated perspective is required. In-depth case study data was collected and analyzed. The data covers eight organizations in a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) food supply chain, including suppliers, the main manufacturer, the logistics service provider, and retailers. Drawing on network theory and stakeholder theory, the study analyzed how these eight organizations experience flexibility across the supply chain. The findings show that each chain member implements flexibility to fulfill the direct needs of the next-tier chain member. Organizations at different positions in the supply chain prioritize other flexibilities. There is no support for overall supply chain flexibility. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Additive manufacturing is an emerging technology that is gaining more ground in various production areas, like medicine, industrial production, and consumer product printing. Aim of this paper is to analyze the applications of this technology on supply chains, investigate how it affects the structure and characteristics of the traditional supply chain, and finally, develop a business model for its optimal use, through the case study of the LEAP-1A jet engine fuel nozzle supply chain. This was achieved in three steps. First, current literature was reviewed, to fully understand the technology, its applications and the production processes it affects. Second, three different supply chain scenarios, i.e. conventional supply chain, centralized 3D printing and decentralized 3D printing were developed and elaborated, so as to allow the easier identification of the differences of the supply chain processes among the scenarios. To select the most effective scenario, an online survey with the participation of experts was conducted, to attribute weights to indicators identified through the literature review. Finally, a business model for the chosen scenario was developed using the Business Model Canvas. The analysis and evaluation of the indicators revealed that the most effective supply chain model is a decentralized additive manufacturing model. Based on the overall results it can be concluded that additive manufacturing simplifies the supply chain, increases flexibility in design and production and reduces transport and logistics costs. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Driven by the policy imperatives of mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improving energy security, an increasing proportion of global energy demand is being met by nonfossil energy sources. The socioeconomic and environmental benefits of replacing fossil fuels with bioenergy are complex; however, debate continues about issues such as best practices for biomass removal, stable supply chains, and GHG mitigation. With the greatest biomass per capita in the world, Canada could play an increasing role in the future of global bioenergy and the emerging bioeconomy. This paper reviews the utilization of feedstock salvaged after natural disturbances (fire and insect outbreaks) to supply wood-based bioenergy, by addressing the following multidisciplinary questions: (1) How much salvaged feedstock is available, and what are the uncertainties around these estimates? (2) How can sustainable practices to support increased removal of biomass be implemented? (3) What are the constraints on development of an integrated supply chain and cost-effective mobilization of the biomass? (4) Is the quality of biomass from salvaged trees suitable for conversion to bioenergy? (5) What is the potential for climate change mitigation? In average, salvaged feedstock from fire and insects could theoretically provide about 100 × 106 oven Dry ton (ODT) biomass per year, with high variability over time and space. Existing policies and guidelines for harvesting of woody biomass in Canadian jurisdictions could support sustainable biomass removal. However, uncertainties remain as to the development of competitive and profitable supply chains, because of the large distances between the locations of this feedstock and available processing sites. Another uncertainty lies in the time needed for a benefit in climate change mitigation to occur. A flexible supply chain, integrated with other sources of biomass residues, is needed to develop a cost-efficient bioenergy sector.

Design/methodology/approach: A random sample of 260 companies obtained from a population of 1,717 Spanish companies that occupy an intermediate position in the supply chain has been used to test the proposed hypothetical framework. Telephone surveys using a computerized system have been used to collect data, obtaining a response rate of 15.6 and a structural equation model has been designed to test the six proposed hypotheses. Findings: Companies initially implement Lean Production to optimize Mass Personalization processes and improve business performance. However, in the presence of Supply Chain Flexibility, Lean Production implementation no longer has a direct impact on Mass Personalization and business performance, but it does have an indirect impact through the flexibility it achieves (shown as a total mediating path). Therefore, companies should implement Lean Production to achieve flexibility and thus optimize the Mass Personalization processes and obtain better performance. Originality/value: Academics and business managers may have supporting evidence on the role played by the total mediating effect of Supply Chain Flexibility on the relationship between Lean Production, Mass Personalization and business performance. A better knowledge of these management resources and their relationship could affect the way researchers and practitioners approach them, becoming more aware of the important role of the supply chain in competitiveness. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Retail companies, as production systems, must use their resources efficiently and make strategic decisions to obtain growing and stable revenues, especially when market conditions are becoming more competitive and profit margins are increasingly pressured. Thus, sales forecasting is crucial to maintain competitiveness in the retail segment, but obtaining inaccurate forecasts can lead to stock shortages, causing delays in deliveries and generating customer dissatisfaction, as well as increasing inventory, increasing the cost of warehousing, forcing the “burn” of stock through promotional campaigns, directly affecting profitability. Forecasting the demand for products and services and adapting the supply chain by finding a balance has always been and will continue to be a challenge in the retail segment. This research aims to evaluate the main methods and identify the one with the greatest accuracy in sales prediction. Based on an integrative literature review (ILR), three main methods were evaluated: time series, artificial neural networks and machine learning algorithms. The results show that machine learning is more suitable in terms of accuracy, particularly when models contain exogenous and endogenous variables, in addition to allowing the identification of hidden patterns in demand that can be used to identify market trends. However, in markets with constant demands and few external interferences, its use is not justified because, for these cases, the use of time series is simpler and less costly. © 2022 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

abstract={An important attribute of a supply chain in a competitive and volatile market environment is the ability to respond rapidly to demand variation. A particularly relevant application is the forest products industry, where a promising strategy to improve the struggling business model entails the shift from commodity products toward high-value specialty products. A key implication is that new process and supply chain designs have sufficient capability to respond quickly to market changes, such that product availability is high. In this study, we develop a computational framework for dynamic operability analysis of process supply chains. A dynamic model of a multiproduct, multiechelon system supply chain system is developed, and incorporated within an optimization framework. A two-stage stochastic programming approach is applied for the treatment of demand uncertainty. A bicriterion optimization problem is formulated for generating the Pareto frontier between an economic and responsiveness criterion. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the applicability of this framework. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Different procurement decisions taken by relief organizations can result in considerably different implications in regards to transport, storage, and distribution of humanitarian aid and ultimately can influence the performance of the humanitarian supply chain and the delivery of the humanitarian aid. In this article, we look into what resources are needed and how these resources evolve in the delivery of humanitarian aid. Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, we develop a framework to categorize the impact of local resources on the configuration of humanitarian supply chains. In contrast to other papers, the importance of localizing the configuration of the humanitarian supply chain is not only conceptually recognized, but empirical investigations are also provided. In terms of methodology, this article is based on the analysis of secondary data from two housing reconstruction projects. Findings indicate that the use of local resources in humanitarian aid has positive effects on programs' overall supply chain performance and these effects are not only related to the macroeconomic perspective, but benefits expand to improvements related to the use of knowledge. At the same time, it was found that local sourcing often comes with a number of problems. For example, in one of the cases, significant problems existed, which were related to the scarcity of local supplies. Both housing reconstruction projects have indicated the continuous need for changes throughout the programs as a dynamic supply chain configuration is important for the long-term sustainability of reconstruction aid. © 2014 Decision Sciences Institute.},

Each company can handle only its own strategy or planning. We also propose a simple strategy for manufacturing agents focusing on individual profit.

abstract={We consider a generalization of the well-known generalized assignment problem (GAP) over discrete time periods encompassed within a finite planning horizon. The resulting model, MultiGAP, addresses the assignment of tasks to agents within each time period, with the attendant single-period assignment costs and agent-capacity constraint requirements, in conjunction with transition costs arising between any two consecutive periods in which a task is reassigned to a different agent. As is the case for its single-period antecedent, MultiGAP offers a robust tool for modeling a wide range of capacity planning problems occurring within supply chain management. We provide two formulations for MultiGAP and establish that the second (alternative) formulation provides a tighter bound. We define a Lagrangian relaxation-based heuristic as well as a branch-and-bound algorithm for MultiGAP. Computational experience with the heuristic and branch-and-bound algorithm on over 2500 test problems is reported. The Lagrangian heuristic consistently generates high-quality and in many cases near-optimal solutions. The branch-and-bound algorithm is also seen to constitute an effective means for solving to optimality MultiGAP problems of reasonable size. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={Blockchain technology has been hailed as the technology of the future, not only for banking and finance but also for supply chain management and logistics. As lack of transparency in global supply chains is a major risk for sustainability, blockchain offers an attractive solution in the form of a reliable platform to create transparency and risk management. Not considering the nascent stage of the technology, companies are investing millions of dollars into blockchain solutions for many business problems including that of supply chains. However, blockchain-enabled networkwide transparency and visibility also inject new dynamics into supply chains through introduction of structural changes like redefining what is organizational boundary, creating new resources, and a new transactional economy for supply chain management. The structural changes also create a fundamental need for organizations in a supply network to adapt their supply chain processes to this new and emerging supply chain structural dynamics for organizational and network-level efficiency and sustainability. For efficient restructuring of the supply chain processes, organizations need clarity regarding what should be the focus of their processes for creating sources of competitive advantage. Using topic modeling, a text mining technique, this work finds the focus areas of supply chain processes in organizations with examples of successful application of blockchain technology. Apart from how these organizations have integrated the strengths of blockchain in their supply chain processes, we also provide an exhaustive theoretical explanation about how firms can create sources of competitive advantage from blockchain technology. Identification of the focus areas will also help operations and supply chain managers planning to implement blockchain technology and devise plans for data-centric decision-making for their SCM processes for efficiency. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

The results in this study suggest a number of issues which must be addressed by the researchers and managers. Therefore, assessing the third variable is vital to have a meaningful interpretation of the association among study variables. In a study, if a relationship does not take into account the mediating mechanism, then it fails to get complete understanding of the relationship. In addition, failing to consider the effect of a mediator may not have clear explanation of the relationship outcome. Contrarily, a model which considers the mediating mechanism is likely to estimate accurate relationship among variables under study. Therefore, in order to reach to the legitimate conclusions and decisions, the practitioners and scholars must consider the significance of competitive advantage on performance and intellectual capital (CAP) nexus.

The optimization takes into consideration of disturbances of banana quality and estimated arrival time. Therefore, decisions are updated each day to cope with the possible disturbances.

abstract={Concrete formwork is a system supporting and shaping concrete components and its potential reuse has been increasingly considered in recent years. On-site concrete formwork reuse contributes to cost savings and material waste reduction. However, concrete formwork reuse among different construction sites is still limited. In addition, on-site formwork planning is inherently complicated, and dynamic processes of formwork reuse increase the complexity since on-site emergencies result in various changes. This study aims to provide an appropriate approach to analyze the dynamic processes of formwork reuse among construction sites, for minimizing both the total cost of each site and the overall formwork consumptions. A mathematical model is first developed to analyze formwork utilization on a single site, and an agent-based model is then proposed along with discrete events to implement and simulate formwork reuse with dynamic changes among construction sites configuring a supply chain. The mathematical model minimizing the total cost of concrete formwork enables the understanding of decisions and behaviors of a single construction site and provides a basis for simulation modeling. In the agent-based model, four major decision agents consisting of construction sites, commercial formwork suppliers, waste disposal centers, and transportation trucks are developed. Considering asymmetric information, a negotiation protocol is integrated into agents’ behaviors to facilitate interactions. With the agent-based modeling and simulation, the optimal strategies for construction sites to reuse formwork can be generated. The results of a case study indicate that formwork reuse in the supply chain can outperform that on a single site and results in a cost saving of 25.38%, a quantity reduction of 33.56%, and a surplus reuse value reduction of 73.18%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Firms are grappling with multiple challenges because of COVID-19, such as supply discontinuity, disruptions, irregular demand patterns, and service delivery issues, among others. The disruption brought by the pandemic has highlighted the relevance of responsiveness and agility in service chains in particular. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic, however, has made design of agile and responsive supply chains difficult, especially for services that draw on intangible, unique resources. In this paper, we develop relevant—and thus far largely absent—theory for the design of service supply chains through a model of service supply chain fit that will guide service firms to prepare better for COVID and future threats. Our model guides the identification of the right supply chain (responsive, efficient, or agile) for services based on their operant resources, which are the intangible resources that act on other resources. Using a qualitative study, we first draw on service-dominant logic and supply chain fit framework to develop the concept of service supply chain fit; that is, the strategic consistency between a service firm’s operant resources and its supply chain. We then validate our model using survey data. The results indicate that service supply chain acts as both moderator and mediator for the relationship between operant resources and firm performance. Our findings indicate that, unless managers view service supply chain fit strategically and invest in developing operant resources for the right supply chain, future COVID-like disruptions may continue to severely impact firm performance. © 2022 INFORMS},

abstract={Background: The South African public sector faces numerous internal and external risks that limit the performance of its entire supply chain. An understanding of these risks and their effects is an important milestone in overcoming them. Aim: This article tested the relationship between supply chain risks, flexibility and performance in the South African public sector. Method: A survey questionnaire was administered to 307 supply chain practitioners who were based in the public sector in Gauteng. A structural equation modelling procedure was utilised in testing the proposed relationships. Results: The results of the study showed that six supply chain risk factors, namely government policies, supply complexity, availability of skills, supplier performance monitoring, information security and process efficiency exert significant influences on supply chain flexibility. In turn, supply chain flexibility exerts a positive influence on the performance of the public supply chain. Conclusion: Managers in government may be able to improve the public supply chain management function through the suitable management of the supply chain risk factors considered in this study. © 2019.

abstract={Recently, crossdocking techniques have been successfully applied in responsive supply chain management. However, most researches focused on physical layout of a crossdock, or scheduling operations within a crossdock. In this paper, we study a multi-crossdock transshipment service problem with both soft and hard time windows. The flows from suppliers to customers via the crossdocks are constrained by fixed transportation schedules. Cargos can be delayed and consolidated in crossdocks, and both suppliers and customers have specific hard time windows. In addition to hard time windows, customers also have less-restrictive time windows, called soft time windows. The problem to minimize the total cost of the multi-crossdock distribution network, including transportation cost, inventory handling cost and penalty cost, can be proved to be NP-hard in the strong sense and hence efficient heuristics are desired. We propose two types of meta-heuristic algorithms, called Adaptive Tabu Search and Adaptive Genetic Algorithm, respectively, to solve the problem efficiently. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show that both of them outperform CPLEX solver and provide fairly good solutions within realistic timescales. We also perform sensitivity analysis and obtain a number of managerial insights. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to reflect on recent closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) practices using a natural resource-based view (NRBV) and dynamic capabilities (DC) perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Two empirical case studies of CLSC exemplars are used to discuss the theoretical relevance of these views. Findings: The paper shows how strategic resources help companies in two sectors achieve successful CLSC designs. Strategic supply chain collaboration is an important success factor but also presents a number of challenges. The NRBV is used to explain the importance of new resources in technology, knowledge and relationships and stresses the role of DCs to constantly address changes in the business environment to renew these strategic resources. Research limitations/implications: This research elaborates on NRBV theory related to CLSCs and reinforces the inclusion of DCs. It specifies the application of NRBV in the context of textiles and carpet manufacture and highlights the inherent conflicts in seeking value while moving towards sustainable development. Practical implications: Investments in technical and operational resources are required to create CLSCs. Pure closed-loop applications are impractical, requiring relationships with multiple external partners to obtain supply and demand for recycled products. Social implications: CLSCs may provide opportunities for social enterprises or third sector organizations collaborating with manufacturers. Originality/value: This paper provides insights into the constituent resources needed for successful CLSCs. It also helps move CLSC research from a tactical logistics problem to a problem of strategic resources and relational capabilities: what we term “dynamic supply chain execution”. This paper develops a framework for transitioning towards CLSCs, underlining the importance of co-development and forging new relationships through commitment to supply chain redesign, co-evolution with customers and suppliers and control of supply chain activities. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Led by the Obama administration, health-care laws, regulations, and policies have recently undergone dramatic changes with the hopes of improving universal access to quality health care. Such changes, however, pose unprecedented challenges of controlling ever-rising health care costs, while sustaining the high level of heath care services. To cope with these challenges, the health-care community and policy makers have long sought innovative solutions that can allow them to streamline health care practices and enhance productivity to the full potential. Though often overlooked in the past, an innovative solution that was increasingly put forward by many managerial experts is the adaptation of supply chain principles for health care that are designed to reduce wasteful spending, strengthen connectivity among health care partners, and increase visibility of needed care and resources. In an effort to help health care professionals add value to their systems, this paper traces the evolution of health care supply chain research, synthesizes the past and current research efforts to develop viable health care solutions and then proposes promising future research themes that can fine-tune these solutions. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Nowadays, it is necessary to paying attention to the opportunities and threats in the field of industry and trade, and evaluate the ability of industries and companies in dealing with uncertainties and existing risks, and it is very important to manage supply chain risk. The main purpose of this study is to be careful against risky suppliers and reducing the injury rate in the event of a disruption. Therefore, in this regard, a multi-stage mixed integer programming model with a proactive approach has been used; that in the first stage, the model reports the amount of supply from suppliers without considering the risk criterion, and at the same time, it seeks to optimal state of minimization the supply chain costs (including purchase cost, shipping, maintenance, supplier selection and return goods). In the second stage, after the suppliers which supplying the parts, have been identified, the model seeks to minimize the identified risks of suppliers under different scenarios. In the third stage, the model tries to achieve an optimal state of supplying the parts from less risky suppliers. In the continuation of this study, an integrated multi-objective programming model has been designed, which will be solved by the epsilon constraint method, and the best output will be reported from the Pareto’s optimal set of answers; Finally the results of the model will be compared in two multi-stage and integrated multi-objective modes and the correctness of the performance is confirmed. © 2021 KIIE},

abstract={In this paper we develop a stochastic programming approach to solve a multi-period multi-product multi-site aggregate production planning problem in a green supply chain for a medium-term planning horizon under the assumption of demand uncertainty. The proposed model has the following features: (i) the majority of supply chain cost parameters are considered; (ii) quantity discounts to encourage the producer to order more from the suppliers in one period, instead of splitting the order into periodical small quantities, are considered; (iii) the interrelationship between lead time and transportation cost is considered, as well as that between lead time and greenhouse gas emission level; (iv) demand uncertainty is assumed to follow a pre-specified distribution function; (v) shortages are penalized by a general multiple breakpoint function, to persuade producers to reduce backorders as much as possible; (vi) some indicators of a green supply chain, such as greenhouse gas emissions and waste management are also incorporated into the model. The proposed model is first a nonlinear mixed integer programming which is converted into a linear one by applying some theoretical and numerical techniques. Due to the convexity of the model, the local solution obtained from linear programming solvers is also the global solution. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={While past studies showcased the importance of supply side capability in customer orientation, not much has been said on matching the specific aspects of customer side fulfilment with supplier side exchange. The present study broadly aims at establishing the linkage between various aspects of customer orientations and nature of supply chain exchanges. It serves to address the dilemma which the firm faces while choosing the nature of its exchange relationship with supplier and how does this relationship can impact various aspects of customer orientations. We test our hypotheses on 2000 firms from four countries in Latin America. We take advantage of the 2017 World Bank Enterprise Survey. In addition to descriptive statistics, multiple hierarchical regressions were used to test the study hypotheses and use robust variance estimator to deal with sources of heteroskedasticity in the data. The findings revealed that in order to achieve market flexibility in the form of tailor-made customer fulfilment, firms not only require specificity in exchange with suppliers, but also they should not engage in deep and frequent exchange relationship with its suppliers. Therefore, the supply side capability of flexibly searching and screening suppliers and forming ad hoc contracts as per requirements is necessary to achieve market side flexibility in the form of tailor-made customer fulfilments. It is necessary for firms to resort to matching their customer orientations with their supply side strategy. Only close matching of supplier side relational strategies with customer orientation by aligning firm’s supply side flexibility with market flexibility works well for the firms. The present study makes theoretical and practical contributions to the strategic market/customer flexibility, supply chain exchange and customer orientation literature and relational capital perspectives. © 2019, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.},

abstract={Remanufacturing is a processing for recycling the availability value of used product; it contains recovery, disassembly, cleaning, overhaul, repair, and replacement operations, and product recovery operations in remanufacturing supply chains face continually changing product demand. In this paper, according to the principle and procedure of system dynamics modeling, system dynamic model of two-stage remanufacturing reverse supply chain including a reproducer and recycler is established. The simulation of model can be used to analyze the remanufacturing supply chain system from the macroscopic qualitative view and microcosmic quantitative view, and to improve the structure and get parameter optimization. As for the purpose of reducing the operation cost and improving the gross profit, this paper analyzes the influence of different factors to the cost and total profit of remanufacturing reverse supply chain through dynamic simulation. Through analyzing and controlling the change of the impact factors, this paper presents the remanufacturing supply chain operation mode with higher benefits. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={Purpose: COVID-19 has pushed many supply chains to re-think and strengthen their resilience and how it can help organisations survive in difficult times. Considering the availability of data and the huge number of supply chains that had their weak links exposed during COVID-19, the objective of the study is to employ artificial intelligence to develop supply chain resilience to withstand extreme disruptions such as COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: We adopted a qualitative approach for interviewing respondents using a semi-structured interview schedule through the lens of organisational information processing theory. A total of 31 respondents from the supply chain and information systems field shared their views on employing artificial intelligence (AI) for supply chain resilience during COVID-19. We used a process of open, axial and selective coding to extract interrelated themes and proposals that resulted in the establishment of our framework. Findings: An AI-facilitated supply chain helps systematically develop resilience in its structure and network. Resilient supply chains in dynamic settings and during extreme disruption scenarios are capable of recognising (sensing risks, degree of localisation, failure modes and data trends), analysing (what-if scenarios, realistic customer demand, stress test simulation and constraints), reconfiguring (automation, re-alignment of a network, tracking effort, physical security threats and control) and activating (establishing operating rules, contingency management, managing demand volatility and mitigating supply chain shock) operations quickly. Research limitations/implications: As the present research was conducted through semi-structured qualitative interviews to understand the role of AI in supply chain resilience during COVID-19, the respondents may have an inclination towards a specific role of AI due to their limited exposure. Practical implications: Supply chain managers can utilise data to embed the required degree of resilience in their supply chains by considering the proposed framework elements and phases. Originality/value: The present research contributes a framework that presents a four-phased, structured and systematic platform considering the required information processing capabilities to recognise, analyse, reconfigure and activate phases to ensure supply chain resilience. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Additive manufacturing (AM) offers unique production characteristics which among those, toollessness and production of complex geometries are potentially significant to operations efficiency. Previous research has illustrated the potential sufficiency of this technology to affect the supply chains‟ arrangements and enabling decentralized production configurations. While, one of the important advantages of AM enabled distributed production is the increased flexibility, which is a necessity in today‟s competitive and ever changing global supply chains, number of obstacles have kept this method from wide implementation. In this paper, we study the possible supply chain modifications to decrease the cost of an AM-enabled decentralized production system. In other words, we perform a cost-benefit analysis on various AM supply chain strategies in a spare parts context to realize the independent operational factors affecting the implementation cost of additive manufacturing. Moreover, we analyze the ways to adapt the supply chain management to enable full potential of AM considering the present technology. © SFF 2014.All rights reserved.},

abstract={Supply chain integration has become a major challenge for companies in the current context. Information sharing, and collaboration improve supply chain flexibility, tractability, and efficiency. Several studies have demonstrated, the positive and the significant relationship between supply chain integration and firm performance. Other studies have focused on the factors that affect this relationship. Supply chain complexity is a contingency factor that affects this relationship. Based on the literature review and through a confrontational approach, the authors propose a conceptual model to show how the complexity of supply chain affects the benefit of integration. Propositions are posited with suggestions for further research. Authors suggest that there are three dimensions of supply chain complexity which moderate the effect of supply chain integration on the firm performance: upstream, internal and downstream complexity; that there is a taxonomy of firm’s group based on their level of each dimension of complexity and the effect of integration differs from one group to another.

abstract={This paper investigates how organization should design their supply chains (SCs) and use risk mitigation strategies to meet different performance objectives. To do this, we develop two mixed integer nonlinear (MINL) lean and responsive models for a four-tier SC to understand these four strategies: i) holding back-up emergency stocks at the DCs, ii) holding back-up emergency stock for transshipment to all DCs at a strategic DC (for risk pooling in the SC), iii) reserving excess capacity in the facilities, and iv) using other facilities in the SC's network to back-up the primary facilities. A new method for designing the network is developed which works based on the definition of path to cover all possible disturbances. To solve the two proposed MINL models, a linear regression approximation is suggested to linearize the models; this technique works based on a piecewise linear transformation. The efficiency of the solution technique is tested for two prevalent distribution functions. We then explore how these models operate using empirical data from an automotive SC. This enables us to develop a more comprehensive risk mitigation framework than previous studies and show how it can be used to determine the optimal SC design and risk mitigation strategies given the uncertainties faced by practitioners and the performance objectives they wish to meet. © 2015},

abstract={Supply chain flexibility (SCF) represents the capability of firms to respond to unanticipated changes in customer needs and competitor actions. Given the growing research interest in flexibility strategies, the development of a valid and reliable instrument to measure organizational responses toward environmental uncertainties or risks is imperative. However, no systematic and scientific research has been conducted to develop such an instrument. The present study adopts a comprehensive and rigorous procedure to develop a multifaceted scale for SCF through an empirical investigation. The results of a confirmatory factor analysis suggest that SCF can be operationalized as a second-order factor model comprising four dimensions, namely: sourcing flexibility, operating system flexibility, distribution flexibility, and information system flexibility. A series of goodness-of-fit indices further demonstrates that this scale is internally consistent, reliable, and valid. The various findings suggested in the present study provide a more succinct picture of SCF, and the well-validated scale could be used as a basis for further research and theoretical groundwork in the field of supply chain management. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To adapt, reduce or eliminate stimuli (uncertainty, disturbances or changes), making the SC more flexible is emerging as a new strategic tool. In reality, SCs are managed by various performance measures and flexibility is one of them, which is being more focused by researchers and industry practitioners. However, Supply Chain Flexibility (SCF) has continued to be a major challenge to comprehend and put it into real practice. An attempt has been made to develop a flexibility scorecard focusing on the flexibility metric in a balanced way.

abstract={Today's supply chains are operating in complex, risky, ambiguous and uncertain business environments. Managers of supply chain (SC) are therefore under pressure to build high level of flexibility in the SC operations. However, supply chain flexibility (SCF) is a complex, dynamic, multifaceted, context specific and application-oriented concept, viewed from a strategic and customer perspective. SCF is not easy to comprehend and put into real practice, the foremost reason is the diverse nature of the three forces viz. stimuli, enablers and inhibitors and their dynamics in the SC. In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate SCF from a company perspective, especially in the viewpoint of making SCF a reality. The relevant data collected from the organisation is used to analyse the dynamics among the three forces using force field analysis (FFA). The study appears to be promising in the point of view of developing a decision support system for managing SCF. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Organisations have been facing several disturbing events, problems and changes affecting overall performance of their Supply Chains (SCs). To be competitive by quickly responding to disruptions, building enough flexibility in SCs is emerging as a new business strategy. However, it is very difficult to identify how much flexibility is required in different functions of the SC, as it depends on the nature and level of uncertainty faced by the process, facility or organization. In this paper, SCF is logically attributed to a business function synonymously with the efficiency of the corresponding business unit, wherein the leveraging factors are treated as the inputs and the benefits as the outputs. Here, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach is used as a benchmarking tool for deriving the advantage of optimisation in many ways. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Performance measurement systems (PMS) have commonly been applied to evaluate and reward performances at managerial levels, especially in the context of supply chain management. However, evidence suggests that the effective use of PMS can also positively influence the behaviour and improve performance at an operational level. The motivation is to accomplish organisational goals, namely to increase supply chain flexibility by responding to evermore-varying customer demands in a timely manner. The purpose of the study described in this paper was to develop a conceptual framework that adopts performance measures for ex-ante decision-making at an operational level within the supply chain. To guide the research, five questions were asked and subsequently key gaps have been identified. In an attempt to fill the gaps, a case study at a major global brand beverage company has been carried out, and as a result, a conceptual framework of the PMS has been developed. Overall, the research offers a foundation of the applicability and impact of PMS in the supply chain and provides a framework that attends to some of the potential uses of PMS that so far have not been practically applied. The outcomes from the testing indicate that the initial gaps identified in the literature have been addressed and that the framework is judicious with scope for practical applicability. The framework is deemed worthy of further testing in different operational contexts of the supply chain. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The aim of the study is to better understand the effectiveness of a fundamental question in supply chain management is: 'How should supply chains be managed when operations compete in different ways in different markets?' Demand for the former products will be relatively stable and predictable, but demand for the latter will be far more uncertain. In addition, the profit margin commanded by the innovative product will probably be higher than that of the more functional product. However, the price (and therefore the margin) of the innovative product may drop rapidly once it has become unfashionable in the market. The supply chain policies that are seen to be appropriate for functional products and innovative products are termed by Fisher efficient supply chain policies and responsive supply chain policies, respectively. By contrast, responsive supply chain policy stresses high service levels and responsive supply to the end-customer. The inventory in the network will be deployed as closely as possible to the customer. In this way, the chain can still supply even when dramatic changes occur in customer demand. Fast throughput from the upstream parts of the chain will still be needed to replenish downstream stocks. However, those downstream stocks are needed to ensure high levels of availability to end-customers. © 2018 Newswood Limited. . All rights reserved.},

abstract={Given the limited number of middlemen in short food supply chains, producers marketing through such channels must carry out various tasks associated with production, processing (if applicable) and marketing. Since productivity increases with specialization, it is presumably difficult for such producers to achieve high levels of labor productivity in each of the tasks they perform (in terms of organizing the work and controlling for costs). This study reports on the results of a detailed analysis of the apparent labor productivity in each activity segment (production, processing and distribution) on farms in Quebec (Canada) that market through short food supply chains. We adapted the concept of a complex activity system and the Work Assessment method to reflect the context in Quebec and the unique features of integrated farming models based on direct marketing. In total, we analyzed work organization on 32 Quebec farms to determine how added value and work hours are allocated among different activity segments. Our analysis of apparent labor productivity highlights the heterogeneity of farms involved in direct marketing as every farm studied had a unique profile. In addition, work patterns reflected the background, choices and skillsets of farmers and different combinations of production factors were utilized. Overall, labor productivity was lower in production-related tasks, although this was often offset by higher productivity levels in other activity segments. Our results indicate that greater productivity in the areas of processing or distribution allows farms in short food supply chains to be financially sustainable. The findings of our study also confirm that farmers involved in direct marketing work hard to sustain their activity systems, even though net earnings are often low when compared to the amount of effort involved. However, farmers are partially compensated in other ways, such as through client appreciation and work enjoyment. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2019.},

The data were analysed using ethnographic content analysis in three stages, which generated propositions aligned to aggregate dimensions identified in the literature. The findings suggest that there is an underlying demand and value for increased integration, and a willingness and trust amongst the focal actors to integrate more with upstream and horizontal partners. However, implementation would be hindered by the focal actors’ limited capabilities and maturity in supply chain management and supply chain integration. The research concludes that focal actors, delivering long-term programmes of planned and response works, could adapt prevailing supply chain methodologies to benefit from increased integration. The research contributes to knowledge through an increased understanding of supply chain integration considerations in asset maintenance and renewal programmes. © 2018, Massey University.

Science mapping analysis was employed, using co-word networks in a longitudinal framework. Science mapping analysis differs from other tools in that it includes the use of bibliometric indicators. The great number of studies published makes it possible to undertake a conceptual analysis of how qualitative marketing research has evolved. To show the conceptual evolution of qualitative marketing research, four study periods were chosen. The results made it possible to identify eight thematic areas that employ qualitative research in the field of marketing: Consumer behaviour, Supply chain management, Dynamic capabilities, Methodology, Media, Business to business marketing, International Marketing and Customer Satisfaction. © 2014, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={This research was carried out as an effort to encourage performance improvement of renewable energy power plants. The purpose of this study was conducted to measure the level of influence of strategic partnerships in creating better business performance in renewable energy industry companies in Indonesia. Strategic partnerships have an important role in developing business performance, including by encouraging dynamic capabilities, supply chains, and improving the regulatory system owned by the renewable energy business lines in Indonesia. Our previous research model that we published shows that regulation plays a very dominant role, then we modify it by issuing regulatory variables that uncontrollable by management. We try to see the effect of exogenous variables that can be fully controlled. Data related to renewable energy industry is collected and presented in this study for completeness. Test data using partial least square equipped with various supporting data obtained from government institutions and private sector that have sufficient information about renewable energy industry. The findings of this study state that to improve business performance, strategic partnerships need to be carried out optimally through various efforts including strengthening collaboration in aligning the supply chain and developing dynamic capabilities within the organization. For the future, it is expected that all stakeholders involved in the renewable electricity generation industry in Indonesia can improve their business performance so that they can increase electricity supply to remote villages and able to transform use of primary energy sources from fossils to environmentally friendly renewable energy where potential is widely spread throughout region so that sustainable life in the world is more awake. © 2019, Econjournals.

abstract={Recent advancements in information technology have enabled a paradigm shift in product manufacturing. Specifically, cloud-based distributed manufacturing has become a viable service for small and medium companies and prosumers, since it caters to the needs of these stakeholders. Distributed manufacturing offers significant benefits, including reduced cost, shorter lead time, and increased supply-chain flexibility. With interest in these services on the rise, however, there have not been substantial efforts to assess the sustainability performance of cloud-based distributed manufacturing. Sustainability assessment tools are not able to accommodate the unique attributes of cloud-based manufacturing, including broad geographic distribution, real-time autonomous customer support, and dynamic supply chains and processes driven by customer preferences. Thus, this research aims to develop an adaptive sustainability assessment framework for evaluating cloud-based distributed manufacturing systems using an integrated sustainability indicator for environmental, economic, and social impacts. The framework is demonstrated for distributed additive manufacturing as a service. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.},

In this research, we proposed an IoT based Dynamic Food Supply Chain for Smart Cities which not only ensures the food quality but also provides intelligent vehicle routing as well as tracing sources of contamination in FCM. Furthermore, a smart sensor data collection strategy based on IoT is utilized which would improve the efficiency and accuracy of the supply chain network with the minimized size of dataset and vehicle routing algorithm is introduced and tracing the contamination sources of infected food in the markets. Our proposed model is evaluated with the comprehensive evaluation and used various performance metrics such as tracing accuracy, delay, execution time, and traveling time.

Design/methodology/approach – A survey of 75 Indian small-scale manufacturers in Coimbatore (Southern India) was conducted. Findings – India, which is a thriving emerging economy, is an ideal location for this study. Results indicate that if managers wish to ensure improved supply chain flexibility, firms must work to improve information quality. Research limitations/implications – The small sample size is a limitation of the study, so too is the narrow sector targeted (small-scale manufacturing). Practical implications – The results reinforce the fact that supply chain management has many elements that can impact a manufacturing firm's responsiveness, which is especially true in an emerging market like India.

abstract={Purpose - This paper aims to empirically analyze how adaptive collaboration in supply chain management impacts demand forecast accuracy in short life-cycle products, depending on collaboration intensity, product life-cycle stage, retailer type and product category. Design/methodology/approach - The authors assembled a data set of forecasts and sales of 169 still-camera models, made by the same manufacturer and sold by three different retailers in France over five years. Collaboration intensity, coded by collaborative planning forecasting and replenishment level, was used to analyze the main effects and specific interaction effects of all variables using ANOVA and ordered feature evaluation analysis (OFEA). Findings - The findings lend empirical support to the long-standing assumption that supply chain collaboration intensity increases demand forecast accuracy and that product maturation also increases forecast accuracy even in short life-cycle products. Furthermore, the findings show that it is particularly the lack of collaboration that causes negative effects on forecast accuracy, while positive interaction effects are only found for life cycle stage and product category. Practical implications - Investment in adaptive supply chain collaboration is shown to increase demand forecast accuracy. However, the choice of collaboration intensity should account for life cycle stage, retailer type and product category. Originality/value - This paper provides empirical support for the adaptive collaboration concept, exploring not only the actual benefits but also the way it is achieved in the context of innovative products with short life cycles. The authors used a real-world data set and pushed its statistical analysis to a new level of detail using OFEA. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In this paper, we respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by constructing supply chain network optimization models, which explicitly include labor as an important variable in the network economic activity links, along with associated capacities. Labor is a critical resource in supply chains from production to transportation, storage, and distribution. In a pandemic, the availability of labor for different supply chain network activities may be disrupted due to illness, fear of contagion, morbidity, necessity of social/physical distancing, etc. The modeling framework considers first elastic demands for a product and then fixed demands, coupled with distinct types of labor capacities in order to capture the availability of this valuable resource in a pandemic, as well as possible flexibility. The supply chain network framework, which includes electronic commerce, is relevant to many different supply chain applications including protective personal and medical equipment, as well as to particular food items. Theoretical results as well as computed numerical examples are presented. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this chapter, we develop static and dynamic competitive supply chain network models with multiple manufacturers and freight service providers. The manufacturers compete with one another in terms of price and quality of the product manufactured, whereas the freight service providers compete on price and quality of the transportation service that they provide for multiple modes. In contrast to the models in preceding chapters in which either demand price functions or fixed demands were utilized, here we use direct demand functions. In addition, in this chapter, we consider both product quality as well as freight service quality in consumer decision-making. Manufacturers and freight service providers maximize their profits while considering the consequences of the competitors’ prices and quality levels. Bounds on prices and quality levels are included that have relevant policy-related implications. The governing equilibrium conditions of the static model are formulated as a variational inequality problem. The underlying dynamics are then described, with the stationary point corresponding to the variational inequality solution. An algorithm, which provides a discrete-time adjustment process and tracks the evolution of the quality levels and prices over time is proposed, and convergence results given. Numerical examples illustrate how such a supply chain network framework, which is relevant to products ranging from high value to low value ones, can be applied in practice. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

An algorithm which provides a discrete-time adjustment process and tracks the evolution of the quality levels and prices over time is proposed, and convergence results given. Numerical examples illustrate how such a supply chain network framework, which is relevant to products ranging from high value to low value ones, can be applied in practice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

It was initially applied to the production process, displaying a competency enhancing effect but not changing substantially the industry structure and governance pattern. It was only when applied to the distribution process, the governance-granting process, that its impacts were fully deployed, allowing the entry of new types of players adopting new business models and challenging the former governance pattern: the hierarchical governance was replaced by a pattern in which agents organise themselves in project-based, adhoc configurations, and market access is not controlled by large companies.},

This is especially apparent in areas such as financial institutions and enterprise risk management, where the actions of a single agent (firm or bank) can impact all the other agents in interconnected networks. In this paper, we use agent-based modeling (ABM) in order to analyze how local defaults of supply chain participants propagate through the dynamic supply chain network and interbank networks and form avalanches of bankruptcy. We focus on the linkage dependence among agents at the micro-level and estimate the impact on the macro activities. Combining agent-based modeling with the network analysis can shed light on understanding the primary role of banks in lending to the wider real economy. Understanding the linkage dependency among firms and banks can help in the design of regulatory paradigms that rein in systemic risk while enhancing economic growth. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={The construction industry has dynamic supply chains with multiple suppliers usually engaged in short-term relationships. Government legislation, novel types of payment agreements, conventional information technology solutions, and supply chain management best practices have endeavoured to solve payment-related financial issues in the construction industry, which are mainly caused by the complexities of the construction supply chain. Nevertheless, payment-related issues persist as one of the key challenges in the industry. Applications of blockchain technology-a trusted, distributed data storing mechanism-along with smart contracts are gaining focus as solutions for complex interorganisational processes. A smart contract is a self-executing script that codifies a set of rules or agreements between multiple parties and runs across the blockchain network. This paper identifies the suitability of blockchain and smart contract technologies in solving payment issues in the construction industry. An expert forum of construction industry stakeholders served as the primary data collection method through a structured questionnaire. The key finding of the paper is that blockchain and smart contract powered solutions can significantly mitigate the payment and related financial issues in the construction industry, including partial payments, nonpayments, cost of finance, long payment cycle, retention, and security of payments. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={In the current context characterized by turbulent market conditions and the increasing relevance of sustainability requirements, reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) offer great potentialities for supply chains and networks. While plenty of contributions have addressed RMSs from a technological and system-specific perspective since the mid-1990s, the research interest for the strategic potentialities of RMSs at the supply chain level is recent and mainly related to building supply chains’ resilience and sustainability. Despite the interest, methods to support supply chains to strategically exploit RMSs are still missing, while being highly needed. In this paper, a method—consisting of an index to assess machines reusability and a mixed integer programming (MIP) algorithm—is provided to support the identification of reusable and reconfigurable machine candidates at the early stage of the strategic network design. The overall method allows machines to be compared based on their reusability and geographical locations. The application of the method, as well as an example referring to the production of emergency devices during the COVID-19 pandemic are reported. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are also discussed, and, among others, strategic parameters related to machines have been identified and elaborated as enablers of supply chain reconfigurability; the proposed method supports practitioners in improving supply chain resilience and sustainability. The method also encourages practitioners towards the development and adoption of reconfigurable machines. Finally, this study also has social impacts for local communities and stimulates customer-centric collaboration among companies belonging to similar industries and sectors. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={In recent years, the hyper-competitive marketplace has led to a drastic enhancement in the importance of the supply chain problem. Hence, the attention of managers and researchers has been attracted to one of the most crucial problems in the supply chain management area called the supply chain network design problem. In this regard, this research attempts to design an integrated forward and backward logistics network by proposing a multi-objective mathematical model. The suggested model aims at minimizing the environmental impacts and the costs while maximizing the resilience and responsiveness of the supply chain. Since uncertainty is a major issue in the supply chain problem, the present paper studies the research problem under the mixed uncertainty and utilizes the robust possibilistic stochastic method to cope with the uncertainty. On the other side, since configuring a supply chain is known as an NP-Hard problem, this research develops an enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain optimal/near-optimal solutions in a reasonable time. Based on the achieved results, the developed algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions (i.e. solutions with zero or a very small gap from the optimal solution) in a reasonable amount of time. The achieved results demonstrate the negative impact of the enhancement of the demand on environmental damages and the total cost. Also, according to the outputs, by increasing the service level, the total cost and environmental impacts have increased by 41% and 10%, respectively. On the other hand, the results show that increasing the disrupted capacity parameters has led to a 17% increase in the total costs and a 7% increase in carbon emissions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Wine producers are facing financial and operational challenges as they operate and compete in a highly traded global arena where consumers are spoilt for choice. Consequently, it is vital for wine producers to implement the industry best practices and continuously adapt their supply chain processes in order to survive. As supply chain management practices create value for wine producers, stakeholders and throughout the supply chain, it is key that the performance of the supply chain is measured. Currently limited research has been conducted in supply chain efficiency and the utilisation of performance metrics in the South African wine industry. It is against this background that this study aims to determine whether the South African wine industry should have a standard set of metrics to be used for comparative purposes across the South African. A case study approach was adopted for this study. Data was collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews using an interview guide with ten participants at five wine producing estates located in the different wine growing areas within the Stellenbosch region. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. The findings reveal that the participating wine producing estates have simple internal performance metrics in place that meet their immediate operational needs. However, they do not look beyond to see how measuring, and monitoring key supply chain metrics, and by using these to benchmark their supply chain performance against their competitors, may help them identify opportunities for improvement for their estates. Providing details of the potential insights and benefits that the South African wine producers could gain by measuring and monitoring supply chain performance and benchmarking their results against their peers and the industry leaders. We contribute by providing approaches for vineyards and wineries to improve their supply chain performance using metrics. This approach will assist the wine producing estates to prioritise better, manage their resources in a more efficient and effective way, and to reduce costs. © 2019 Academic Conferences Limited.

Implementing circularity in business operations is a practice of achieving sustainability which is of utmost significance for achieving sustainable development goals established by the United Nations. This study empirically examines the relation among flexibility, AI–IoT adoption, and SC firm performance under the circular economy (CE) environment based on resource orchestration theory (ROT), an integrated version of the extended-resource-based view, and dynamic capability theory (DCT). Data were collected from Indian manufacturing firms through a questionnaire-based survey and examined using “structural equation modeling (SEM).” The study results show that information flexibility and organizational flexibility have the highest impact on AI–IoT adoption. Organizational flexibility shows full mediation with AI–IoT, which would influence the SC firm performance directly. The analysis also indicates that CE will affect the relation between organizational flexibility and AI–IoT adoption. These findings pave the way for cross-country analysis, formation of practical strategies, and policies related to AI–IoT and CE implementations. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Given the requirements of international businesses, this research addresses the supply chain network design problem in the real-world situation by considering four critical features: sustainability, resiliency, responsiveness, and globalization. For this purpose, a multi-objective mathematical model is proposed that minimizes the environmental impacts and the total costs and maximizes the social impacts while considering the resilience and responsiveness of the global supply chain. Then, the modified fuzzy robust stochastic method is employed to tackle the uncertainty. This study selects one of the most important medical devices during the pandemic (COVID-19) namely the blood bank refrigerator as a case study. Afterwards, the proposed multi-objective model is solved by developing a novel method named as augmented lexicographic weighted Tchebycheff method. Based on the obtained results, an increase in the responsiveness level of the supply chain can lead to increasing the sustainability dimensions, including job opportunities, safety, carbon emission, and economic aspects. Moreover, an increase in demands harms the economic, environmental, and responsiveness targets. The demand has a pivotal role in selecting resilience strategy, as well. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: The main aim of this paper is to develop a supply chain efficiency framework to improve overall business performance in the competitive era. This paper offers a critical literature review on supply chain efficiency that aims to reveal the basic research that has been carried out, the problem areas and requirements for the efficiency in the new era of the supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology followed during this research involves beginning with a wide base of articles lying at the supply chain intersection, performance measurement topics, and then screening the list to concentrate on supply chain efficiency. Findings: Findings show that supply chain efficiency in the modern era remains an open research field. This research contributes to the supply chain literature by clarifying the supply chain efficiency definition, defining key measurements and variables for supply chain efficiency and developing a supply chain efficiency framework to improve overall performance. Practical implications: This study will be very useful to the scholars working in this field. The proposed framework would help researchers and academicians to understand every dimension and variable of supply chain efficiency, allowing practitioners to measure efficiency levels and identify improvement measures. This framework would also act as a comprehensive guide for future studies and business practices. Originality/value: As there are several state-of-the-art review papers on various supply chain areas, there is a lack of literature available on supply chain efficiency studies that can provide a comprehensive framework for researchers on related literature. Thus, the present study seeks to bridge this gap in the supply chain literature. Also, this study will provide a strong basis for researchers and academicians to apply the supply chain efficiency measurement system to the dynamic supply chain. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={By increasing advances in the production networks planning, understanding of relations and dynamics of production networks is gaining more attention in order to use all network capabilities. To achieve this understanding, it is not only important to have a good understanding of individual firm’s manufacturing flexibility next to supply chain flexibility, but also to consider the internal (among production network’s facilities) and external (other tiers of supply chain) relationships in a production network. Studying the production network’s flexibility dimensions facilitates the effective use of the synergy of cooperation in the network. On other words, the potential in the network structure cannot be exploited unless the planning and control of network consider the available flexibility of network and operationalize the opportunities which arise. This paper identifies different dimensions of flexibility in a production network and describes how they can support firms in responding to customers’ needs. This research employs exploratory and descriptive approaches and uses a single case study of Norwegian diary to capture the dynamics of production networks. Three product categories with different network characteristics are selected, and the identified network flexibility dimensions are investigated for these products. The status of case company under each flexibility dimension is presented and discussed. © 2015, Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This paper presents an active learning approach implemented in the Supply Chain Management (SCM) course. In this course, the fundamentals of supply chain and logistics, drivers of supply chain performance and analytical tools necessary to develop solutions for a variety of supply chain design problems are covered through class lectures and case study discussions. In the past few years, due to the growth in the needs of organizations for "Lean" principles, the course was modified to satisfy this requirement more efficiently. For this purpose a hands on experience workshop, TimeWise simulation game, was utilized where the students could physically simulate the implementation of lean principles in a supply chain network. Through this simulation, students explored the impact of various lean tools such as Kanban, pull and just-in-time production systems, and flow management in a dynamic supply chain. In addition, this game empowers the learners with a better understanding of the fundamental concepts of a collaborative supply chain such as demand management, inventory management, role of information system and coordination, transportation, finance and accounting. The implemented simulation game could enhance material retention and foster critical thinking among the students by increasing visibility and illustrating the concerns of any supply chain. Moreover, several directed presentations by speakers invited from diverse industries and ISM (Institute of Supply Chain Management) were arranged to expose the students to some real case studies. To assess the effectiveness of the course modules and applied pedagogical methods, and measure learning satisfaction, a survey is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each instructional tool, students' perception of knowledge and satisfaction in this course and the results are analyzed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.},

To overcome the potential adverse selection problem due to the asymmetric information, the supplier designs a menu of supply contracts that stipulates both the wholesale price and the purchasing quantity. We find that under information asymmetry, the supplier will optimally set a higher wholesale price but a lower purchasing quantity for the manufacturer with high innovation efficiency than that for the manufacturer with low innovation efficiency. As a consequence, the manufacturer with high innovation efficiency will significantly underinvest in innovation due to information asymmetry in addition to the impact of the double marginalization effect. Moreover, although a longer contract period tends to better motivate innovation, it can also magnify the influences of adverse selection on supply chain contracting, leading to a higher wholesale price for the manufacturer with high innovation efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Economic incentives are among the key drivers of outcomes and the evolution of food systems. This is particularly true in market economies and for agricultural commodities, but the economic performance of food systems has global relevance. Analysis of markets for food-especially from a systems perspective-provides insights about how to improve outcomes from food systems. In addition, the organizational structures that link different actors in a food system can often be usefully considered from the perspective of supply chains. As a result, economic and supply chain analyses of food systems issues can complement other analytical perspectives and support informed decision making to improve desired outcomes. This chapter emphasizes three commonly-used types of economic and supply chain models: spatial optimization models, partial equilibrium models, and dynamic supply chain models based on participatory group modeling building and system dynamics. For each, we provide an overview of the mathematical structure of the model, discuss the kinds of food system issues for which these models are most appropriate, indicate data needs and suggest priority areas for future development and application. We also illustrate a small number of environmental and food security metrics that can be included in analyses based on these methods. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Electromobility is one of the main solutions for tackling current challenges such as climate change or the scarcity of fossil resources [1]. Currently, there are large uncertainties regarding future production volumes of electric vehicles with forecast for 2025 varying between 4 % and 38% [2]-[4]. This demand volatility combined with rising importance of supply chain partners requires a fast adaptability of production volumes within the supply chain leading to a higher need of supply chain flexibility [1]. In this paper we present a method to optimize the contractual volumes between two supply chain partners coordinated by a quantity flexibility contract with fixed flexibility. Specifically, we examine whether a quantity flexibility contract fulfils its coordinating role in settings of changeable production systems. We validate our method with an example from the production of electrified automotive powertrains. The results show that we can further improve both costs and supply chain flexibility but that the coordinating role of the quantity flexibility contract is limited. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The electric mobility market is characterized by demand volatility and a changing supply chain with new to the industry suppliers. In order to cope with demand volatility, the production capacities must be synchronized with external supply chain partners through changeability and flexibility measures. We define flexibility as the ability to quickly react to changing demand volumes within the current supply chain and production structure. Changeability needs further investments to adapt to the changing environment. This paper presents a method for the design of flexible and changeable supply chains, predicated on an examination of two companies’ production systems and two different supply contract designs. We consider a quantity flexibility contract and a new developed contracting matrix. The method is being validated by a prototypical application in the production of electrified automotive powertrains. The results show an increase in supply chain flexibility for the quantity flexibility contract and we are able to introduce a changeable supply chain with the use of the contracting matrix. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Purpose: Rethinking how to build resilience in supply chains is once again highlighted by COVID-19. Research on supply chain resilience has established flexibility as a firm-level antecedent that contributes to supply chain resilience. However, the authors know little about how supply chain flexibility is developed within a firm. Drawing on social capital theory, the authors claim that the way supply chain managers are embedded in their social networks plays a critical role in developing this antecedent. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that supply chain managers' structural and relational embeddedness in their reference network, comprised of individuals from whom they seek advice, is instrumental to developing supply chain flexibility, which subsequently enhances the firm's supply chain resilience. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data collected from 485 manufacturing firms in Australia and Hayes and Preacher's (2014) parallel multiple mediator model were employed to empirically test the hypotheses. Findings: The findings of the study establish that supply chain managers' structural and relational embeddedness in their reference network indeed have implications for developing supply chain resilience. Furthermore, the mediator through which managers' social embeddedness influences supply chain resilience is identified in the current study. Originality/value: The study contributes to the extant literature on supply chain resilience, investigating the role that supply chain managers' social capital play in developing the resilience of their firm. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper takes up the mathematical modelling and dynamic behaviour of a distribution warehouse of a responsive supply chain when subject to sudden increases in replenishment lead times, which are dynamic in nature. The warehouse is at the downstream end of the supply chain, and caters to the demand off-take of the responsive chain. We study analytically the effect of large and sudden increases in replenishment lead times on the system, and derive the performance behaviour of the system, looking at how quickly the system recovers from the disruption and is restored to normal operation, with the objective of being able to come up with a dynamic control scheme with enhanced performance. We find that the conventional dynamic control schemes perform poorly; and we therefore propose a modified dynamic control scheme which enhances the control and performance of such systems. Additionally, we present a comparison of the performance of this system with that of one with zero lag and sudden demand increase, which highlights the increased difficulty of controlling this system with sudden lags compared to the other. Concomitantly, the comparison also highlights the utility of such dynamic controls in achieving better performance of the chain under such conditions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to conduct an exploratory study that will assist supply chain firms in the development of partner satisfaction, flexibility, and supply chain performance. The authors examine how the interaction of information exchange, partner interaction, knowledge sharing and flexibility as mediated through partner satisfaction effectuates firm performance. The goal of this research is to answer the supply chain managers’ need to better understand where to invest their time and effort to get improved firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The model was tested with panel data from 105 experienced, US-based supply chain managers. Structural equation modeling using partial least squares approach was utilized to conduct the analysis. Findings: The results provide crucial evidence that simple information exchange among supply chain partners does not result in improvements in firm performance or partner satisfaction, but, when mediated through the flexibility construct, it does. Further, the use of integration tools has a moderating effect on the relationship between flexibility and firm performance. The results suggest that working closely with supply chain partners helps ensure improved relationship satisfaction, and can reduce issues that can impact firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The empirical research presented requires additional validation though larger sample data from supply chain managers. Practical implications: This study stresses on the importance of managers using information exchange, partner interaction, and knowledge sharing as a means of improving their firm’s indirect influence on firm performance through flexibility and integration tools. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies in the supply chain literature that integrates flexibility as a mediator variable. Additionally, this study introduces the new construct of integration tools to the supply chain literature. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The manufacturing industry in India started moving towards multi channel supply chain for delivering products to the customer by his preferred channel of purchasing. But firms are far behind to achieve a goal of omnichannel where there exists better interface between various channels which increases their customer range and customer comfort. Also, today consumer awareness had increased with respect to environmental protection while at the other end the government rules and regulations also force firms to go with adopting sustainability concepts like green and recycling processes in supply chains. This work deals with this major issue faced by the firms in India that how to integrate multiples channels in designing their supply chain network considering economic and environmental sustainability simultaneously. This paper presents a mathematical model for an integrated multi channel closed loop supply chain network problem, the modeling decisions that include the selection of the entity that will fulfill the demands of the omni channel customer during different time periods and the supplier selection process integrated with the production amounts, inventory levels, stock-outs and shipment quantities. The aim of the model is to minimize the total cost incurred to the customer, total cost incurred in running the supply chain and minimize the total pollution emissions from all the transportations of the products between the different stages of the supply chain. It is a mixed integer programming problem considered for a leading kitchenware company in southern part of India and solved using IBM CPLEX optimizer. The result shows that how the dynamics of omni channel customer options affects the optimal supply chain structure. © 2019, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

Most of conventional works assume that the leader-follower relations for multiple companies are treated as constant in all time periods. However, in order to accommodate changes caused by uncertainties, it is necessary to develop reconfigurable supply chain that can flexibly change its structure of supply chain according to the dynamical changes of manufacturing environment. In this paper, a multi-period supply chain planning model that can change the structure of supply chain over time periods under uncertainty is developed. We provide a novel production planning model that can effectively determine the optimal configuration of leader-follower relationship in the bilevel supply chain planning problem. Then, the total profit of the supply chain is analyzed by a game theoretical analysis. The effects on the change of configurations are investigated from computational experiments. © 2017 The Authors.

In order to have a dynamic design, multiple strategic periods are considered during the planning horizon. Furthermore, different short-term decisions are integrated with long-term decisions related to the network design problem. Two of these short-term decisions determine selling price of products in forward logistics and buying price of used products from customer zones in reverse logistics. Due to the complexity of the proposed multi-objective model, a Multi-Objective Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (MOICA) is proposed to solve the model, and the results are compared with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Finally, to evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm, several numerical examples are used of which the results indicate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2018 Sharif University of Technology.

abstract={This paper presents the analysis of the relationship among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) internationalization, logistics capabilities, and supply chain flexibility (SCF) from an integrative perspective to address this gap in the literature. We analyzed the networking process of SMEs internationalization using a system dynamics approach in order to determine the behavior of the relationship between internationalization, SCF, logistics capabilities, trust and commitment. The analysis of these relationships provides a better understanding of the role of trust and commitment as enablers of SCF through the development of logistics capabilities in the networking process of SMEs internationalization. This work constitutes the basis to prove further hypothesis and empirical research in order to develop strategies regarding SCF as a sustainable competitive advantage for SMEs internationalization. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={In our globalised world today, in which companies increasingly compete with one another not only on their products that may be manufactured anywhere on the planet, but undoubtedly also on their functional and flexible supply chain and its visibility. Owing to unpredictable catastrophes on the opposite side of the Earth, or due to bad planning of its customers any producer may be affected - through a chain of mutually interconnected suppliers - by supply shortages. Here information systems and the ability of the whole system to identify, in real time, the situation of the required material play an irreplaceable role. Following correct identification, the next condition of successful delivery is material flow control. The company that can be considered as the winner is the one that - thanks to its high flexibility and visibility of its own supply chain - is capable to inform its customers in real time while being ready to offer them the best alternative solution if necessary. The aim of this article is to characterise individual features of the supply chain visibility problem, proposing systemic solutions employing available technologies as well as standardised processes.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of three important relational capabilities – absorptive capacity (AC), transactive memory systems (TMS), and organisational interoperability (OI); on the flexibility of buyer-supplier relationships and performance in retail supply chains. Drawing on the relational view of strategic management, the impact of relational capabilities on two forms of supply chain flexibility is examined – configuration flexibility (CF) for switching suppliers with minimal penalties, and planning and control flexibility (PCF) for altering supply schedules, quality, and delivery lead-time. Design/methodology/approach: Strategic- and tactical-level managers from 211 retail stores in the UK were surveyed. The authors validated a measurement model with structural equation modelling and tested four hypotheses on the mediating role of relational capabilities on supply chain flexibility and retail performance, controlling for size, duration of relationship, and market segment. Findings: Results showed that the three relational capabilities partially mediated the positive effect of CF and PCF on operational performance in big middle and niche retailers. Examining the interaction effect of the forms of flexibility on the relational capabilities and performance, the authors found positive interaction effects on TMS and OI but a non-significant effect on AC. Practical implications: In addition to providing novel theoretical insights on supply chain flexibility, the findings have practical implications for supplier selection and buyer-supplier relationship management. Originality/value: Overall, the study highlights the impacts of relational capabilities on adopted operational strategies such as flexibility, buyer-supplier relationships, and retail performance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Summary: A dissolved air flotation (DAF) system upgrade was proposed for an urban paper mill to recycle effluent. To understand the influence of operating variables on the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water consumption, a dynamic supply chain model was linked with life cycle assessment (LCA) to produce an environmental inventory. Water is a critical natural resource, and understanding the environmental impacts of recycling water is paramount in continued development of sustainable supply chains involving water. The methodology used in this study bridged the gap between detailed process models and static LCA modeling so that operating variables beyond discrete scenario analysis could be investigated without creating unnecessarily complex models. The model performed well in evaluating environmental impacts. It was found that there was no single optimum operating regime for all environmental impacts. For a mill discharging 80 cubic meters of effluent per hour (m3/hour), GHGs could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 17.5 m3/hour, while water consumption could be minimized with a DAF capacity of 25 m3/hour, which allowed insight into where environmental trade-offs would occur. The study shows that more complexity can be achieved in supply chain modeling without requiring a full technical model. It also illustrates the need to consider multiple environmental impacts and highlights the trade-off of GHG emissions with water consumption in water recycling. The supply chain model used in this water treatment case study was able to identify the environmental trade-offs from the operating variables selected. © 2013 by Yale University.},

abstract={Because the supply network of an enterprise should be flexible enough to capture and overcome market dynamics, one of the major concerns of global enterprises is to make their supply network reconfigurable. Although many strategies for flexible management of a supply network have been proposed, especially for mitigating supply network risks, it still remains unclear how to apply the strategies to a supply network and how to reconfigure the supply network. This paper examines the influence of flexibility strategies in a dynamic global market environment on the structure of supply network, and proposes a method of reconfiguring the supply network of an enterprise to cope with its flexibility strategies. A reconfigurable supply network model is proposed, and flexibility strategies are classified, and critical indices of strategies are defined. In the proposed model, each business actor is defined as a network node and each node has its own goal. A node optimizes its goal to reduce and overcome the risk of market environments. The result of optimization indicates that the supply network structure is reconfigured dynamically. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Projects supply chain is overwhelmed with unethical practices. Managing construction projects supply chain, which is traditionally void of transparency, has led to issues of corruption, vested interest, clientelism, ghosting, bid rigging and poor professional ethical standards. The centralized nature of data management in the construction industry is characterized by the lack of visibility and transparency of details and this lack of visibility is a major cause of inefficiency in construction project delivery. The objective of the paper is to assess the indicators for adaptability of projects supply chain using blockchain technology. The article adopts a bibliometrix strategy to extract qualitative data from existing peer-reviewed articles. The research design is a combination of different approaches, including bibliometric and visualization, bibliometric and content analysis, as well as bibliometric, visualization and content analysis. Data was obtained from articles indexed on SCOPUS and Web of Science. R-studio was used for data analysis, while VosViewer was used for visualization. The paper is a part of an on-going research. The research is exploratory and adopts a pragmatist approach. The research is expected to develop a framework that will introduce transparency and provenance in projects supply chain using blockchain technology. Findings from this review show that there are indicators for adaptability of construction projects supply chain using blockchain. © 2021 ISEC Press.},

abstract={The recent Covid-19 outbreak has caused severe disruption of the global supply chain, which tests firms’ ability to survive and build resilience. The concept of adaptive supply chain management (A-SCM) has never been tested against a severe supply chain disruption, such as a pandemic. Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine how firms in Indonesia develop resilience through the implementation of components of adaptive supply chain management, namely risk management, resource reconfiguration and supply chain flexibility, in order to survive severe supply chain disruption. Research design, data and methodology: A qualitative method and PLS-SEM were used to analyze 120 data collected from Indonesian manufacturing firms in various industries. Results: The findings show that risk management, resource reconfiguration, and supply chain flexibility are important components that make up A-SCM. However, only risk management contributes to help build firm resilience in the presence of severe supply chain disruption. Conclusions: The components of A-SCM have been empirically tested. The implication is that managers should carefully use RM to prepare firms for different scenarios to develop contingency strategies. This research contributes to the supply chain management body of knowledge in the context of pandemic-level disruption and broadens the dynamic capabilities perspective. © 2020.

abstract={Offshoring manufacturing activities to low-cost countries has been an industry mantra for decades. Some companies have started to re-think this supply chain configuration choice; bringing production back home. Reshoring or backshoring production has seen increased interest. This evolution poses a major question for sustainable supply chain management scholars: what is the relationship between reshoring, or global supply chain reconfiguration, and environmental sustainability at firm, country, and global levels? In this paper we propose a set of potential research directions facing this question. Main aspects of reshoring, including motivations, implementation and impact are all discussed in this context. © 2018},

abstract={World markets are highly interlinked and local economies extensively rely on global supply and value chains. Consequently, local production disruptions, for instance caused by extreme weather events, are likely to induce indirect losses along supply chains with potentially global repercussions. These complex loss dynamics represent a challenge for comprehensive disaster risk assessments. Here, we introduce the numerical agent-based model acclimate designed to analyze the cascading of economic losses in the global supply network. Using national sectors as agents, we apply the model to study the global propagation of losses induced by stylized disasters. We find that indirect losses can become comparable in size to direct ones, but can be efficiently mitigated by warehousing and idle capacities. Consequently, a comprehensive risk assessment cannot focus solely on first-tier suppliers, but has to take the whole supply chain into account. To render the supply network climate-proof, national adaptation policies have to be complemented by international adaptation efforts. In that regard, our model can be employed to assess reasonable leverage points and to identify dynamic bottlenecks inaccessible to static analyses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The paper investigates the extent to which capacity investment considerations interact with the double marginalization effect in a simple supply chain governed by a wholesale price contract. To do so, a non-cooperative differential game model is formulated to study the pricing and capacity investment decisions in a supply chain, which consists of a supplier and a manufacturer. In such a game, there are different decision rules-open-loop, closed-loop, feedback-that are available to the supply chain participants, depending on the observability of the current state of the supply chain. While closed-loop and feedback equilibrium strategies involve the observability of other chain member's production capacity, open-loop equilibrium strategies do not have such requirement. We examine how the supplier and the manufacturer determine, with the different decision rules, their production capacities and pricing policies to maximize their profits over an infinite planning horizon, and determine how the observability of other supply chain's members' production capacity affects the magnitude of the double marginalization effect. Our study suggests that the observability of other chain member's current production capacity entails a lower production efficiency that results in a greater double marginalization effect. This allows us to conclude that observability of other chain member's current production capacity is associated with a greater double marginalization effect. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.

abstract={Purpose: Current understandings of innovation in construction portray it as linear, deterministic phenomena centered around novel objects and technologies deployed in sequentially-organized supply chains. This study aims to develop an enriched understanding of construction innovation as non-linear, socio-material and dynamic phenomena in complex networks by formulating a novel conceptual apparatus of complex adaptive supply networks (CASNs) expanded through actor-network theory (ANT) concepts. Design/methodology/approach: This combined CASN/ANT apparatus is mobilized in the context of a qualitative case study involving a housing construction supply network in Australia making use of offsite manufacturing (OSM) techniques. Findings: The study shows that innovative technologies such as novel OSM products can play an important though not necessarily deterministic role in the evolution of CASNs. The study also explicates the process by which the enrollment of non-human agents and the resulting CASN evolution are linked: innovative technologies shape human and non-human interactions in ways that redefine task delegation, role definition and schemas that are fundamental to the shape of CASNs. Originality/value: Findings provide a compelling empirical basis for arguing that CASNs must be conceptualized as heterogeneous systems and that innovation in construction must be understood as non-linear, socio-material and dynamic, rather than linear and driven by technological determinism. The study also interrogates limiting notions of supply chains and supports the notion of alternative inter-organizational forms to understand construction project work. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In the pharmaceutical sector, supply chain management (SCM) requirements have changed significantly in recent years. The buzzword nowadays when managing global supply chains is adaptation to increasing global complexity and volatility. Growing pressure from financial markets and the difficulty of increasing operating margins and working capital in this environment require efficient planning and execution of global production processes. More and more companies are relying therefore on LEAN SCM - a planning concept for harmonized production and replenishment planning across the entire supply chain with close linkages to organizational processes and IT infrastructure. It is designed expressly to simplify existing planning processes and to improve the synchronization and variability management of global supply chains. This article provides an overview of the key elements of LEAN SCM and its applications in the pharmaceutical sector. It constitutes the first part in a series of five articles that cover the management principles and methods of this new planning approach - featuring production planning, replenishment strategies, organization and performance management, and IT integration in the subsequent articles of this series in detail. © ECV • Editio Cantor Verlag.},

More and more companies are relying therefore on LEAN SCM - a planning concept designed to facilitate harmonized production and replenishment planning along the entire supply chain with close linkage to IT applications. LEAN SCM is designed expressly to simplify existing planning processes and to improve the synchronization and variability management of global supply chains. A series of five articles provides further insights into the concept featuring its key elements, LEAN SCM production planning, LEAN SCM replenishment planning, organization and performance management, and IT integration. This article constitutes the second part of the series and provides an overview of local, site-specific, and asset-based production planning and scheduling. The planning approach is based on the new end-toend LEAN SCM philosophy, emphasizing the paradigm change it represents in mastering increasing variability and uncertainty at production sites and along synchronized supply chains. First, we point out why traditional production planning concepts embedded in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Advanced Planning Systems (APS) systems are reaching their limit in the face of today's market dynamics. Second, we discuss major benefits of cyclic scheduling with product wheels and their recent enhancements, combined in High-Mix Rhythm Wheels, for pharmaceutical and other process manufacturers. Finally, we point out how variability in planning and volatility in final customer orders can be managed most effectively for improved speed at production sites that are embedded in a LEAN-orchestrated supply chain. © ECV · Editio Cantor Verlag, Aulendorf (Germany).},

abstract={Major concern in utilising renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind, is their intermittent nature. Therefore, whether they can be reliable energy sources to provide uninterrupted energy demand when reaching a high share of renewable energy in the system depends on the whole energy supply network. Higher flexibility of RES-based systems can be reached through the development of smart energy concepts. The system dynamics model coupled with a geographical information system platform has been used to analyse space and time dimensions of RES potential using geo-referenced information. This approach allows analysing the whole energy system by determining the best-suited development scenario for each region separately, based on their resource, economic, and technological capabilities. Furthermore, the system dynamics model is complemented with different policies to evaluate their impact on renewable and local energy resource development and economic potential. The results show that the potential for large-scale onshore wind farm capacities with suitable land conditions could be around 5.5 GW, but the forecasted necessary wind power capacity to reach climate neutrality in 2050 is 1.55 GW. Therefore, onshore wind turbines should be promoted to move toward a smart and renewable power system in Latvia. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Due to high energy-intensive processes and a dependence on carbon-based materials, the process industry plays a major role in climate change. Therefore, the substitution of fossil resources by bio-based resources is indispensable. This leads to challenges arising from accompanying changes of the type, amount and location of resources. At the same time, transformable production systems are currently in the focus of research addressing the required flexibility. These systems which consist of modular production and logistics units offer the possibility to adapt flexibly in volatile conditions within dynamic supply chains. Hence, this work compiles elements for environmental sustainability, which minimize the carbon footprint in the process industry: transformable production systems, the utilization of bio-based resources, carbon dioxide and renewable energy as well as the application of these elements in decentral production networks. Finally, possible use cases are determined based on the combination of these elements through a multi-criteria analysis. © 2020 The Authors. ChemBioEng Reviews published by Wiley-VCH GmbH},

abstract={Two logisticians from the Department of Defense offer ideas that may apply to either military and commercial supply chains or combinations thereof. A stable supply chain is where operations are routinized across smooth inter-organizational relationships. When faced with familiar situations, supply chain partners can rely on past experience which has become the basis for routine work; that is, partners employ the reliable frames of reference imbedded in their standard operating procedures. However, unusual situations present emergent, unpredictable risk and require management that is qualitatively different from that in standardized practice. In the face of risky supply chains, adaptive leaders exercise “creative deviance,” and seek to influence others in the chain to diverge from their habitualized frames of reference through divergence and value patterning. While adaptive leadership becomes a mitigation strategy for confusingly novel situations, there are also social risks for supply chain innovators. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This book contains of the investigation is about the process of decision making in supply chain management using a real options analysis framework. Specifically, the authors address issues regarding the optimal inventory level to hedge against demand uncertainties; the timing for equipment capacity implementation under market product mix complexity; the timing for workforce capacity reinforcement aiming market service requirements; and the decisions between integration and outsourcing in an uncertainty environment. Discrete and continuous time methodologies were used to identify the optimal value and timing of the options to adopt, when the demand is stochastic. Additionally, the effect of market requirements, such as product mix complexity and service level, were also taken into consideration. The demand is modeled under different stochastic processes; the impact of unexpected shocks is also explored, which enhances the generalization of the models to different business conditions. The applicability of the models enables the diversification and enrichment of the literature on the real options approach, within supply chain concept. Flexible inventory levels and the flexible capacity are supply chain features that can be used to deal with demand uncertainty. © Exceling Tech Pub.},

abstract={In this paper, two objective functions related to supply chain performance are considered for optimization during several demand periods. Due to fast and dynamic demand variations in recent times, the supply chains for outsourced components also need agility and quick reconfiguration to adapt to these challenges. For a known demand scenario, the manufacturer must select the optimum combination of suppliers to minimize the total cost of supplies as well as the transportation cost. The two objective functions developed in this model represent the minimization of the total cost of supplies including transportation and maximization of reliability of the set of suppliers. As the two objectives may have trade-offs in many instances, a set of Pareto optimal non-dominated solutions is searched using an evolutionary algorithm called self-organizing migration algorithm or SOMA. A case study on the supply chain of a laptop computer manufacturer is selected from the literature to illustrate the implementation of algorithm to real industrial problems. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

abstract={Process automation and information sharing are becoming increasingly important to the successful operation of supply chains. While previous works have investigated the effects of radio frequency identification (RFID), electronic data interchange (EDI), and other transparency technologies on model production/distribution systems, the studies completed to date have not fully examined the implications of these technologies on the supply chains' dynamic behaviour. This is especially true for supply chains which feature heterogeneously implemented transparency technologies. The present work seeks to fill this apparent technical void, by characterizing the impact of both heterogeneously and homogeneously implemented EDI and RFID technologies on the system dynamics of a prototypical multi-stage supply chain model: the beer distribution game. To this end, the effort utilizes high-throughput numerical simulation to characterize the influence of transparency technologies on transient performance metrics (e.g. settling time, cost, and stock outages), and to form a series of succinct conclusions on the technologies' relative utility.},

abstract={The study on big data capability was initiated just recently. The impact of big data capability on companies, such as on companies' other capabilities, is still unclear. Grounded on dynamic capabilities theory, this study proposed a model and tested the impact of big data capability on supply chain dynamic capability and dynamic innovation capability. The research objects are high-tech listed companies in China. By PLS path modelling, the major findings are: 1) big data capability showed positive impact on supply chain dynamic capability; 2) however, unexpectedly, big data capability was found showing negative impact on dynamic innovation capability. In our opinion, the potential reason is that big data application is just initiated, so may lead to certain disorder in the companies. Based on this finding, we call for attention to big data paradox; 3) further, supply chain dynamic capability showed positive impact on dynamic innovation capability; 4) possibly owing to the mediating and moderating effects of supply chain dynamic capability, the total effect of big data capability on dynamic innovation capability is positive and significant.

These requirements can be met by encoding the MSC information using shared domain ontologies. However, difficulty in understanding the syntax and semantics of the shared ontologies hinders the adoption of such ontology-based approach. In this paper, we propose an Ontology-based eXtensible Dynamic Form (OXDF) user interface architecture to assist non-expert users to collect MSC information and represent that information as instances of the shared domain ontology. To achieve this result, we introduce three key innovations: 1) intelligent ontology navigation that dynamically generates forms and form components from the relevant parts of the ontology; 2) intelligent search engine that helps finding relevant ontology entities; and 3) an update mechanism that allows users to define new terminologies to the shared domain ontology. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},

abstract={Today's supply chains are becoming increasingly flexible in nature. While adaptability is vastly increased, these more dynamic associations necessitate more extensive data sharing among different stakeholders while simultaneously overturning previously established levels of trust. Hence, manufacturers' demand to track goods and to investigate root causes of issues across their supply chains becomes more challenging to satisfy within these now untrusted environments. Complementarily, suppliers need to keep any data irrelevant to such routine checks secret to remain competitive. To bridge the needs of contractors and suppliers in increasingly flexible supply chains, we thus propose to establish a privacy-preserving and distributed multi-hop accountability log among the involved stakeholders based on Attribute-based Encryption and backed by a blockchain. Our large-scale feasibility study is motivated by a real-world manufacturing process, i.e., a fine blanking line, and reveals only modest costs for multi-hop tracing and tracking of goods. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is twofold: first, to establish the current themes on the topic of manufacturing and supply chain flexibility (MSCF), assess their level of maturity in relation to each other, identify the emerging ones and reflect on how they can inform each other, and second, to develop a conceptual model of MSCF that links different themes connect and highlight future research opportunities. The study builds on a sample of 222 articles published from 1996 to 2018 in international, peer-reviewed journals. The analysis of the sample involves two complementary approaches: the co-word technique to identify the thematic clusters as well as their relative standing and a critical reflection on the papers to explain the intellectual content of these thematic clusters. The results of the co-word analysis show that MSCF is a dynamic topic with a rich and complex structure that comprises five thematic clusters. The value chain, capability and volatility clusters showed research topics that were taking a central role in the discussion on MSCF but were not mature yet. The SC purchasing practices and SC planning clusters involved work that was more focused and could be considered more mature. These clusters were then integrated in a framework that built on the competence–capability perspective and identified the major structural and infrastructural elements of MSCF as well as its antecedents and consequences. This paper proposes an integrative framework helping managers keep track the various decisions they need to make to increase flexibility from the viewpoint of the entire value chain. © 2019, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.},

abstract={Efficient and effective management of inventory throughout the supply chain significantly improves the ultimate service provided to the customer. Efficient inventory management is a complex process which entails the management of the inventory in the whole supply chain. The dynamic nature of the excess stock level and shortage level over all the periods is a serious issue when implementation is considered. In addition, consideration of multiple factories manufacturing the same product leads to very complex inventory management process The complexity of the problem increases when lead times of stocks are involved. In this paper, these issues of inventory management have been focused and a novel approach based on Genetic Algorithm has been proposed in which the most probable excess stock level and shortage level required for inventory optimization in the supply chain is distinctively determined so as to achieve minimum total supply chain cost. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Keeping safety stocks and designing flexible production systems have long been known to be effective measures for compensating variations in demand. However, current research lacks appropriate methods guiding practitioners in successfully implementing these measures. As implementing flexibility in most cases comes along with an increase in costs, the decisions which flexibility measures to implement require a trade-off between the benefit gained from an increased flexibility, and the costs which apply. The purpose of this paper is to provide a first approach to evaluating this trade-off using discrete event simulation. The concept is presented and evaluated by means of a practical scenario from the table-top product manufacturing industry using the adjustment of production lot sizes and safety stock levels as example flexibility measures. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to determine the cost-optimal flexibility configuration, and find a utilizable flexibility potential lying in different configurations of these measures. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This study examines the tradeoffs in sourcing and sales strategies (i.e., upstream and downstream supply chain strategies) by considering them as components of an integral end-to-end supply chain strategy. We evaluate four end-to-end supply chain strategies under various scenarios using a newsvendor model, and compare the model's predictions against the prescriptions in Fisher's () framework, which recommends “cost-efficient” supply chains for “functional” products and “responsive” supply chains for “innovative” products. We considered combinations of offshore vs. nearshore sourcing, and online vs. brick-and-mortar retailing. This study's key finding is that sourcing and sales strategies are not completely modular: an integral end-to-end strategy may not decompose into an optimal sourcing strategy and a separately computed optimal sales strategy. Our analyses sharpen strategic supply chain thinking by identifying realistic conditions in which an end-to-end strategy with cost-efficient components could outperform one with responsive components for innovative products, or when one with responsive components could be more profitable than one with cost-efficient components for functional products. © 2017 Production and Operations Management Society},

abstract={Recently, there has been a growing literature on biologically inspired algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms and genetic programming, applied to supply chain modelling and inventory control optimisation. Due to the rigidity of the genetic algorithms approach, it is difficult to change the underlying model logic and add richness to the supply chain. While genetic programming provides a more flexible approach than that provided by genetic algorithms, to date its application has been limited to small supply chain modelling problems in relation to optimal inventory policies. This research applies Grammatical Evolution, a relatively new biologically inspired algorithm, to the field of supply chain optimisation, employing human readable rules called grammars. These grammars provide a single mechanism to describe a variety of complex structures and can incorporate the domain knowledge of the practitioner to bias the algorithm towards regions of the search space containing better solutions. Results are presented showing Grammatical Evolution is at least competitive in cost terms, and superior in flexibility, with these methods applicable to any supply chain of the serial or distribution type. Furthermore, Grammatical Evolution shows an adaptive ability that augurs well for supply chains in dynamic environments, such as disruption. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={Natural disasters and unexpected disruptive events have forced practitioners and researchers to build resilience capability into their systems to survive and grow in tempestuous and turbulent times. This study empirically examined the effect of multi-dimensional supply chain flexibility (MDSCF) in improving supply chain resilience (SCRES) under a high supply chain (SC) risk environment. The study incorporated a survey technique and utilized valid responses from 191 large-scale manufacturing (LSM) firms of Pakistan. PLS-SEM is employed to analyze the hypothesized relationships. The findings indicated that MDSCF significantly contributes to improving SCRES. Moreover, the study shows strong significant moderating effects of the customer-oriented and external risks and the weak moderating effect of supplier-oriented risks towards augmenting SCRES. The study contributes to the SC (SC) risk management literature by providing empirical support for the need for multi-dimensional SC flexibility measures in bolstering SCRES under the high SC risk environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Manufacturing organizations aim to adopt integrated supply chain planning to improve their operational performance. Technologies driving the 4th Industrial Revolution can support them by providing real-time data from physically distributed processes. However, in order to achieve an optimal allocation of interdependent production, inventory and transport resources, several planning and control problems have to be considered, which pose theoretical and computational challenges. In this direction, the challenges of dynamic supply chains can be addressed using adaptive simulation-based optimization and Industry 4.0 technologies. Therefore, this research proposes an adaptive simulation-based optimization approach to integrate manufacturing supply chain planning tasks. This approach is capable of dealing with complex systems as well as considering a dynamic environment with stochastic behavior. Finally, a test case is presented to evaluate the computation time feasibility and quality of the solutions provided by the method. In the present application, the method provided a convergence to a best solution in different experiments within a short amount of time, coping with the requirements of complex and uncertain scenarios. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze cross-functional integration processes and their respective impacts on resilience capabilities, with particular emphasis on collaboration, in an automotive supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: A case study was conducted in an automotive supply chain through 18 in-depth interviews with managers from six different companies, namely, two suppliers, one focal manufacturer and three customers. The automotive industry is one of the most vital industries in the Brazilian economy and is still recovering from the 2015 financial crisis, making it an interesting case for this research. Findings: The findings reveal several links between resilience and cross-functional integration literatures through the analysis of three basic categories, namely, disruptions (lack of product, interruption of production, delivery delay, organizational bankruptcy and sales loss); capabilities (redundancy, flexibility, adaptability, collaboration, visibility and agility); and integration factors (cross-functional meetings, adequate communication, longevity of relationships, cross-functional training, recognition of interdependence and the consideration given to informal groups). Practical implications: This research addresses several implications for practitioners. Managers should pay attention to the cross-functional teams, which may provide internal collaboration, and hence collaboration in the supply chain. Originality/value: This paper suggests a new concept for the collaboration capability. According to the results, collaboration is the capability of dealing with formal and informal factors to integrate both the internal functions and supply chain members, which can provide visibility, agility and adaptability toward supply chain resilience. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to focus on the impact of supply chain (SC) integration, demand forecasting and supplier performance on patient responsiveness at public hospitals through the mediating role of SC flexibility. Design/methodology/approach: To measure the above stated correlation, a Likert scale with five points and 23 items was used and structural equation modeling was applied. The scale was applied to public hospitals. Statistical software programs (SPSS 18 and LISREL 8.8) were used to analyze the data. The analysis of reported statistics is based on a sample of 129 logistics and SC specialists at public hospitals in the cities representing different regions of Turkey. Findings: The research hypotheses are supported as a result of the analysis. The research reveals that SC flexibility has a mediation effect between SC integration, demand forecasting, supplier performance and patient responsiveness. Practical implications: The increasing number of population, geopolitical position, migration waves, man-made and natural disasters lead Turkish health-care industry to have effective SC plans to satisfy the patients’ needs successfully and reduce the effects of these fatal events. In this sense, SC flexibility is an important factor for health-care industry in responding changing patient demands. At this juncture, the main point is to bring required resources together in the right place and at the right time. Otherwise, health-care institutions cannot serve the affected people because of the non-availability of supply. To achieve it, public health-care institutions should give more importance to the SC principles. Originality/value: Success in SC flexibility in health care can directly affect patient welfare. Thus, focusing on the patient responsiveness is an important aim of the health-care industry. However, it was determined that less attention has been given to understanding patient satisfaction as a result of SC operations. The results indicate that patient responsiveness improvement should be included into strategic plans, and SC efforts should be used as a means of satisfying patient needs quickly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the mentioned relationships at public hospitals. Findings of this paper will have a significant contribution for researchers and health-care professionals in understanding the impact of SC to patient responsiveness. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Maritime port infrastructures rely on the use of information systems for collaboration, while a vital part of collaborating is to provide protection to these systems. Attack graph analysis and risk assessment provide information that can be used to protect the assets of a network from cyber-attacks. Furthermore, attack graphs provide functionality that can be used to identify vulnerabilities in a network and how these can be exploited by potential attackers. Existing attack graph generation methods are inadequate in satisfying certain requirements necessary in a dynamic supply chain risk management environment, since they do not consider variables that assist in exploring specific network parts that satisfy certain criteria, such as the entry and target points, the propagation length and the location and capability of the potential attacker. In this paper, we present a cyber-attack path discovery method that is used as a component of a maritime risk management system. The method uses constraints and Depth-first search to effectively generate attack graphs that the administrator is interested in. To support our method and to show its effectiveness we have evaluated it using real data from a maritime supply chain. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Supply chain networks of modern era are complex adaptive systems that are dynamic and highly interdependent in nature. Business continuity of these complex systems depend vastly on understanding as to how the supply chain network evolves over time (based on the policies it adapts), and identifying the susceptibility of the evolved networks to external disruptions. The objective of this article is to illustrate as to how an agent-based network analytic perspective can aid this understanding on the network-evolution dynamics, and identification of disruption effects on the evolved networks. To this end, we developed a 4-tier agent based supply chain model and simulated the evolution of the supply chain network based on two different partner selection scenarios. Network-evolution diagrams, change in structural characteristics over time and effect of disruptions on the critical nodes for the two different partner selection scenarios are presented. The networkevolution characteristics (social network analysis based node/network level metrics) over time have been quantified and the vulnerability of the evolved networks, due to disruptions that result in reduction in production of the network's critical producer node, has been identified. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Assessing risks in supply chains is a key activity for ensuring the resilience to appearances of common or less predictable adverse events. Such assessments are traditionally carried out based on purely economic factors, leaving out other factors like sustainability, which also encompasses environmental and social dimensions. This paper show the feasibility of supporting the sustainability of supply chains, starting from a risk modelling and simulation framework that was not initially developed with that goal in mind. We first propose an indicative list of sustainability requirements classified by stage in the supply chain organisation. Afterwards, we demonstrate how those requirements can be translated in our framework using queries on simulations that are expressed in a rich language. We then investigate on some strategies to adapt the supply chain to better cope with sustainability requirements. Our work is driven by and illustrated on a manufacturing case study. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The Bullwhip Effect manifests itself in the form of an increased order and inventory variability in the uppermost nodes of the supply chain. This dynamic phenomenon is not yet well understood in closed-loop supply chain settings, despite their growing importance in modern societies pursuing circular economy opportunities. Indeed, the problem-specific literature has provided somewhat conflicting findings. To better understand the Bullwhip Effect in closed-loop systems, we obtain expressions for the order and inventory variance amplification in four archetypes that differ in the structure of information transparency. Interestingly, we observe that the impact of return rates and lead times on the system performance strongly depend on the degree of supply chain visibility. This perspective allows us to revisit discrepancies in prior works. We later move the study from the operational to the economic prism. Here we prove the existence of an optimal return rate, and we derive its expression in the four closed-loop supply chain archetypes. We show that the optimal rate is dependent on the node's cost structure, the lead times, and the variability of demand. Properties of the different closed-loop systems and relevant managerial implications are also discussed in our work. © 2020},

abstract={The paper explores the meaning of flexibility in the context of lean, agile and leagile supply networks and articulates a supply network flexibility framework. Two key 'sources' of flexibility are investigated: vendor flexibility and sourcing flexibility. The paper introduces an extension of the 'leagility' concept beyond the simple material flow decoupling point concept. Two new types of leagility are put forward: (1) leagile with vendor flexibility systems, which combine the use of agile vendors with lean sourcing practices and (2) leagile with sourcing flexibility systems, which combine the use of lean vendors with agile sourcing practices. Case studies of two UK based specialist fashion retailers' supply networks are presented in order to gain insights into the sourcing strategies used and the sources of flexibility employed by retailers at supply network level. A new taxonomy that dynamically links vendor and sourcing flexibility with lean, agile and leagile supply network strategies is proposed. We suggest that the proposed taxonomy can be used as a guideline for firms designing and managing parallel supply pipelines that match different operating environments. The findings add to the understanding of the ways in which the two sources of supply network flexibility (vendor and sourcing) interact in practice and provide evidence of the ways in which companies can strike balances between these sources, as well as the effects that can be achieved and some of the trade-offs involved. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Given the recent dynamics of the automotive industry in the UK, the ability for a firm to be flexible has often taken priority over other performance indicators. Using the notion of distinct business models and trade-offs as our theoretical lens, the purpose of this study was to: (1) Distinguish lean and agile firms based upon production methods; and (2) Compare lean and agile levels of external flexibility (EF) and supply chain flexibility (SCF). Data was obtained from 140 automotive firms in the Midlands (UK) via a survey which was sent by emails. Findings supported the theoretical notion of trade-offs, as firms implementing agile production methods were found to be more flexible in comparison with firms implementing lean production methods. More importantly, the agile firms that possessed high EF levels and SCF levels were predominantly positioned at the lower end of the automotive supply chain, whereas the lean firms were largely found to be operating at the top of the supply chain. First, we provide an innovative way in which lean and agile firms can be conceptualised. Second, as flexibility levels were assessed on actual numerical values, as opposed to using opinion based Likert Scale questions, a methodological contribution is made. Third, as flexibility is in its infancy stage of theoretical development we make an empirical contribution by developing a taxonomy that distinguishes each production concept. Finally, given the supply chain position to where lean and agile firms were found, we invoked a power perspective better understand this phenomenon. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We investigate RFID-enabled Third-party Supply chain (RTS) systems and identify several inherent security and efficiency requirements. We further design a Secure RTS system called SRTS, which leverages RFID tags to deliver computation-lightweight crypto-IDs in the RTS system to meet both the security and efficiency requirements. SRTS introduces a Private Verifiable Signature (PVS) scheme to generate computation-lightweight crypto-IDs for product batches, and couples the primitive in RTS system through careful design. We conduct theoretical analysis and experiments to demonstrate the security and efficiency of SRTS. © 2016 IEEE.},

This paper analyzed the concept of supply chain flexibility evolution and division of the flexibility capacity of supply chain. Then it presented the construction stages and evolution factors of the supply chain flexibility. Due to the timeliness and dynamics of supply chain flexibility, supply chain has to dynamically adjust and real-time monitor the degree of flexibility.

abstract={Combining with the supply chain resources and core enterprise capacity, the flexibility status can be classified into potential flexibility, realistic flexibility and demand flexibility. It establishes the generation and evolution frameworks of the supply chain flexibility, which suggest that dynamic capacity factors and adaptability factors are essential elements to balance the level of flexibility. The findings indicate that there are three principles that supply chain must be followed so as to response quickly: real-time sensing, dynamic control and contingency principles. The evolution mechanism and procedure of supply chain flexibility present that supply chain must coordinate itself with environmental uncertainty and match its flexibility against demand closely in order to stay competitive and being responsive to customers, which is essential to construct an effectively supply chain and has deeply theoretical and practical value.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine alignment between supplier management practices and information systems (IS) strategies (i.e. particular IS applications portfolios), and its effects on supply chain integration and supply chain flexibility. Design/methodology/approach: The paper develops a model and hypotheses suggesting that "lean" supplier practices, when aligned with the "IS for Efficiency" IS strategy, have a positive association with supply chain integration. Similarly, "agile" supplier practices when aligned with the "IS for Flexibility" IS strategy, have a positive association with supply chain flexibility. The paper empirically validates the model using survey data from directors and senior managers in purchasing and supply chain functions from 205 manufacturing firms in the USA. Factor analysis was conducted to test convergent and discriminant validity. Hypotheses testing was done via structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis using SMART Partial Least Square (PLS) software. Findings: The study finds that lean (agile) supplier management practices are positively associated with supply chain integration (flexibility). Further, alignment of lean supplier practices and IS for Efficiency enhances supply chain integration, as assessed by a positive moderating effect of IS for Efficiency on the relationship between lean supplier practices and supply chain integration. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the supply chain - IS interface literature by developing a theoretical basis for analyzing the benefits of different types of IS applications to particular types of supplier management practices. Limitations are that it considers primarily internal supply chain integration as a representative of the entire supply chain's integration (internal and external), and that it relies on data from one person from each organization responding to the survey. Originality/value: The paper theoretically develops and empirically examines a framework proposing that the respective fit or alignment between lean and agile supplier practices with efficient and flexible IS application portfolios has implications for the integration and flexibility of the particular supply chain. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Enterprises in an industrial cluster could dynamically alliance in the form of cluster supply chains to share inner-cluster resources and services, and respond to the ever-fluctuating customer demands in a cost-effective way. However, an effective and feasible method enabling such dynamic cluster supply chain configuration (CSCC) lags behind practice due to the conflict of interests. Researchers are designing All-in-One theoretic models to optimize CSCC with the assumed decision details of all enterprises, while in fact clustered enterprises are seeking effective decentralized decision mechanisms which protect their decision autonomy in the frequently re-configured CSC. A newly emerged multi-disciplinary optimization method, Augmented Lagrangian Coordination (ALC), which supports the open-structure collaboration with strict optimization convergence, is thoroughly investigated in this paper and applied to solve the conflict. Through a complete analysis of CSC's configuration policies in typical stages, a generic CSCC model is proposed and then partitioned into an ALC-based decentralized decision model by the typical decision autonomy distribution in clusters. Clustered enterprises collaborate vertically and laterally along the ALC model through multi-dimensional couplings to achieve the overall consistency and optimality. Results have proved the effectiveness of ALC for CSCC problem. A set of sensitivity analysis is also conducted to find out the condition in which an order has to be fulfilled in a CSC and the most appropriate configuration. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper aims to investigate some dimensions (agility, robustness, disruption orientation and resource reconfiguration) of the SCR during this unprecedented disruption in the Brazilian supply chain context. Design/methodology/approach: Supported by the resource-based view, dynamic capabilities and the SCR literature, we developed a model, which in turn was analyzed and validated by partial least squares structural equation modelling. Findings: The results revealed that while resource reconfiguration and supply chain disruption orientation positively affect SCR, we found a non-significant effect of supply chain robustness and agility. Practical implications: The findings suggest that in a considerable disruption scenario, managers with their supply chain operations in emerging economies should prioritize the development of resources to support the disruption orientation and manage the scarce resources adequately by reconfiguring them.

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to global operations and supply chains. While the huge impact of the pandemic has nurtured important literature over the last couple of years, little is being said about the role of resource orchestration in supporting resilience in highly disruptive contexts. Thus, this study aims to this knowledge gap by proposing an original model to explore supply chain resilience (SCRE) antecedents, considering supply chain alertness (SCAL) as a central point to support resilience. This study focuses on the resource orchestration theory (ROT) to design a conceptual model. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) served to validate the model, exploring data from the UK supply chain decision-makers. The study reveals a number of both expected and unexpected findings. These include the evidence that supply chain disruption orientation (SCDO) has a strong positive effect on the SCAL. In addition, SCAL plays a strong positive effect in resource reconfiguration (RREC), supply chain efficiency (SCEF) and SCRE. We further identified a partial mediation effect of RREC on the relationship between SCAL and SCRE. Surprisingly, it appeared that SCAL strongly influences SCEF, while SCEF itself does not create any significant effect on SCRE. For managers and practitioners, the importance of resource orchestration as a decisive approach to adequately respond to huge disruptions is clearly highlighted by our results. Finally, this paper helps to grasp better how important resource orchestration in operations and supply chains remains for appropriate responses to high disruptions such as the COVID-19 impacts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to explore the current state of research on supply chain flexibility (SCF) and mass personalization (MP) to identify the literature findings to date, research gaps and to provide guidelines for future research in this area. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of 64 papers was undertaken to address the use of SCF as a productive response to MP environments. The methodology used is made up of five steps: formulation of the research questions, identification of studies, selection and evaluation of studies, analysis and synthesis and presentation of the results. Findings: Three main research topics have been identified: personalization levels and flexible processes in supply chain, where flexible processes in supply chain are analysed as a productive response to high levels of MP; supply chain collaborative processes for SCF and MP, where product co-creation and relationships between supply chain members is analysed; and SCF and MP enabling technologies, in which technologies to support MP implementation and SCF are considered. Each of these three main topics have been divided into research lines and research sublines that allowed identifying a positive relationship between the SCF and the MP strategies. Research limitations/implications: Systematic literature review is a methodology reliable and recommended by a large number of scientific papers. However, it depends on available and accessible research studies and the researcher’s criteria. The selection of certain criteria for inclusion and exclusion of papers introduces publication bias, which should be considered an intrinsic limitation to systematic literature review. Originality/value: The main literature findings in each research line and subline related to the SCF-MP relationship are identified and analysed. Furthermore, research gaps and further research lines in the SCF-MP area are highlighted. The information presented in this paper improves the literature on the advances in the SCF use as a productive response to MP environments. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Resilience and flexibility in manufacturing and supply chains are widely discussed at times of the present crises situation due to COVID-19 pandemic. It is a question of ongoing debate among practitioners about the role of flexibility and complexity in building resilience for firms and their supply chains. In this research, we examine the flexible business strategies at the demand, supply, and process side of supply chains contributing to resilience. Five of the major flexible business strategies were acknowledged in this research and the single items for constructing them were posited. In this study, we observe the correlations among the constructs based on survey-based research in electronics manufacturing firms, followed by a dimensionality reduction of constructs using factor analysis. The data collected were subject to several initial tests for ensuring validity, reliability, and adequacy using relevant statistical indicators. The measurement model was converted into a structural model and path coefficients were determined. From the path analysis, the latent variables contributing to flexibility in supply chains were found to be independent estimators of resilience. Adding to it, we observe that the single items for measuring the flexibility of supply, process, product, and pricing strategies were evidenced to be strongly correlated. The results are useful to managers for taking decisions related to flexibility implementation, towards enhancing resilience in supply chains. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

abstract={A key decision in design of a supply chain is the configuration of the network. In this study, supply chain network design problem is investigated and an efficient solution approach is presented. Specifically, a heuristic graph theoretic-based algorithm is proposed for solving a multi-echelon responsive supply chain network design problem with lateral-transshipment among retailers. The possibility of lateral-transshipment is considered to increase the customer satisfaction by increasing the availability of the goods, and to reduce total inventory handling costs. Consideration of lateral transshipment provides a trade-off between transportation costs and inventory handling costs at the retailers. Graph theory is used to investigate and study the structure of the supply chain network and it is shown that the network can be reduced to a k-partite graph. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with an exact commercial solver on test problems. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm generates high-quality solutions in a reasonable time in comparison with the exact solver. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The dynamic nature of the excess stock level and shortage level over all the periods is a serious issue when implementation is considered. In addition, consideration of a factory manufacturing the multiple product leads to very complex inventory management process The complexity of the problem increases when lead times of stocks and raw materials are involved.

abstract={Many developing countries suffer severe energy deficiencies despite their ample reserves of resources – the so-called predicament of “resource rich, energy poor." A leading driver is the energy-economy cycle, where poor economic status, inefficient utilization of limited budget, and energy deficiency reinforced each other and led these countries into a spiral of economic downfall. How to turn this cycle around? It is a classic question but not well answered in the energy policy/economics literature and barely studied in the operations management literature. We apply supply chain design and location optimization models to address the unique features of the energy sector in these countries and present a new class of mathematical models for designing coal-fired energy supply chains. The model captures the interaction among different parts of an integrated energy supply chain, the unique economics of power transmission such as yield losses, the political issues associated with equity, and the dynamic interaction among energy consumption, economy and budget. The model attempts to answer the classic question by determining the optimal and politically feasible ways to build up an energy supply chain under limited budgets for energy security and economic prosperity. Applying the model to Pakistan's recent energy crises, we show that the solutions can significantly outperform the government's plan by reducing the energy gaps faster, boosting the economy stronger with less greenhouse gas emissions. We develop insights as to how an energy supply chain should be built up strategically for developing countries, and how various system parameters may affect the results. © 2017 Production and Operations Management Society},

abstract={Disasters have been striking mankind quite regularly from time immemorial. The way mankind responded to these disasters has changed from just fleeing from the location to modern-day ability to stay put and face the scenario of aftereffects of the disaster. This change in perception and requirement is the result of a sea change in sociopolitical factors as well as advancement in science and technology to cater for the exigencies of a disaster. However, the more the ability to stay back and fight the disaster, the better need be the agility and flexibility to convey the benefits of research and technology to the location where it is needed most at the quickest possible time. This is possible only if there is a robust supply chain (SC) designed to cater for all eventualities. This paper is an attempt to identify the configurations of the SC for disaster management and thus analyze humanitarian logistic issues and try to suggest a model for incorporating humanitarian logistics into SC models. © 2016, Springer India.},

abstract={Even though extensive technologies have been applied to all stages of a supply-chain, the performance of many supply chains has been quite dismal. One potential cause for failure is the lack of comprehending the nature of the demand and therefore being unable to device a supply-chain that would better satisfy that demand. A common mistake is to use an efficient supply chain that calls for a responsive supply chain and vice versa. The paper aims to develop the first wave of empirical investigations related to the impact of supply chain design practices on performance. It investigated a supply chain design model that linked efficiency with responsiveness to optimize performance by deploying postponement. An in-depth case study methodology was adopted to uncover the strategies undertaken by one of the Bangladesh's fastest growing cement manufacturers to create a competitive advantage through its management of the supply chain design alignment. The major elements were verified by surveys. Applicability and exploitability of the diagnostic instrument was validated using action research. Generally, the adoption of segmenting the supply chain process by diffusing the postponing style led to an improved performance, which, in turn, positively impact operational performance. Operational performance enhances organizational performance. Just as processes can be broken into parts, so can supply-chain processes be segmented to achieve optimal performance. This paper underpins the under-researched area of action research in supply chain design and practitioners are provided with a framework for assessing the synergistic impact of postponing practices for optimum upshot. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of customer demand, manufacturing flexibility, cost, and supply chain on product modularity. This study employed a cross-sectional design and a proportionate random sampling procedure was used to select 150 manufacturers from a list of 250 manufacturing companies in Malaysia, which are registered in Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) and Association of Proton vendors. Data was collected from the middle and top management from these selected manufacturing organizations. Findings of this study noted that customer demand, manufacturing flexibility and supply chain has a significant positive effect on product modularity, whereas cost has a negative association with product modularity. Manufacturers, therefore, need to develop customer demand, manufacturing flexibility, cost, and supply chains to ensure the success in developing modularity product manufacturing. This study shows strong association for customer demand, manufacturing flexibility, cost, and supply chain to develop modularity product manufacturing.},

abstract={A p-robust supply chain network (SCN) reconfiguration model under disruptions in dynamic mid-term horizon considering decision-maker (DM)’s risk-attitude is presented. Reconfiguration of SCN within a time horizon by utilising excess resources of undisrupted facilities, outsourcing and capacity expansion is studied. At first, the single-objective cost minimisation problem is formulated and extended as a multi-objective problem incorporating responsiveness as another objective. Pareto solutions are obtained using augmented ε-constraint (AUGMECON) method. The major inferences include: 1) the cost minimisation model opens a fewer facility under nominal condition and prefers capacity expansion strategy under disruptions; 2) the inclusion of responsiveness objective results in opening more facilities with outsourcing as preferred reactive strategy; 3) DM’s attitude significantly affect structural decisions but not the parametric decisions such as capacity expansion, material flow redirection, and outsourcing; 4) a neutral DM selects a dispersed and diversified portfolio of facilities, whereas averse DM opens backup facilities closer to critical facilities.

abstract={Purpose: There is the propensity of airline catering supply chains to adapt their performance measures in order to meet desired service level due to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this paper is to develop a set of metrics for airline catering organisations and explore the choices of SCOR based performance metrics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Case study approach involving an airline catering supply chain organisation is adopted in this research. The SCOR framework is applied in the context of the case study supply chain to develop a performance metrics model for the chain. The performance metrics model is analysed and validated by a set of experts in the case study organisation. The experts are formed into a focus group. The performance metrics were prioritised using MoSCoW method based on the experience of the focus group participants on COVID-19 challenges. Findings: A hierarchical performance measure framework is proposed, and a set of 55 metrics from the SCOR framework is identified and validated for airline catering supply chains. MoSCoW based prioritisation of the metrics by the focus group participants results in 7 Level-1 SCOR metrics and 13 Levels 2 & 3 SCOR metrics been considered as necessary to better mitigate COVID-19 pandemic challenges. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on a single case study and a small number of participants, which limits the generalisability of the results. Practical implications: With the development of performance metrics and the prioritisation presented in this paper, airline catering organisations can monitor their catering logistics performance and use techniques such as MoSCoW to decide performance measures priorities in situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: The work contributes to measuring performance in the airline catering supply chain and the need for considering adapting performance metrics using techniques such as MoSCoW, during challenging periods as in the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, OmniaScience.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved in the recent days, connecting almost everything, starting from electronic devices to people, products, and machines together. Data collected from these connections serve as the basis for solving any real-world problems. In a supply chain network, several data are collected across different players and at different levels. The collected data are processed using different techniques to transform data into meaningful information. This gathered information is internal to the organization, helps in improving the internal or immediate supply chain. The information collected can be stored centralized where all the supply chain partners can access and share required information, leading to performance improvement of the entire [1] supply chain. A research framework is proposed which aims to achieve performance improvement along the entire supply chain. The framework starts by explaining how data collection can be done smartly using IoT. Next, how big data analytical tools can be used to transform data into information is discussed. Then, a mathematical model is proposed to measure the performance of internal and immediate supply chain. Then, how information sharing across the different supply chain partners can be achieved using state-of-the-art technologies is explained. Mathematical model proposed is expanded to measure the performance of the external and the entire supply chain. A case study was done to prove the proposed framework. Lastly how this research paves way for future research is discussed. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Firms are involved in supply chains to achieve operative efficiency, develop strategic advantages, and generate financial profits. However, there is limited evidence regarding how governance mechanisms influence the generation of value from collaboration. Furthermore, how a particular buyer or supplier position provides benefits to partners is unclear. In this paper, we examine the roles of management control information as both a governance mechanism and a source of dynamic capabilities, and its interaction with relational variables to create and capture value following a demand-side perspective. Two separate studies are developed using multigroup structural equation modelling, which analyse buyer and supplier positions played by the firm as a complex supply chain node. The results demonstrate that the characteristics of information sharing have different impacts on value, depending on the role played in the relationship. Although timely information sharing appears to be the key source of operative and financial value in downstream relationships, disaggregated information sharing generates additional strategic advantages in upstream relationships. The presence of different control-trust frameworks mediates the process of value generation, leading to different managerial and theoretical implications. © 2017 by the authors.

Supply chains range from responsive supply chains to efficient supply chains. Supply chain selection depends on different criteria like total supply chain cost, volume flexibility, service level etc. In lieu of this, supply chain selection is considered as Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem. Several authors solved MCDM problems without considering vagueness in the decision-maker's subjective judgements. Hence an attempt is now made in this paper to focus on vagueness in ranking supply chains against multiple criteria.

abstract={Respiratory failure complicates most critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is characterized by heterogeneous pulmonary parenchymal involvement, profound hypoxemia and pulmonary vascular injury. The high incidence of COVID-19 related respiratory failure has exposed critical shortages in the supply of mechanical ventilators, and providers with the necessary skills to treat. Traditional mass-produced ventilators rely on an internal compressor and mixer to moderate and control the gas mixture delivered to a patient. However, the current emergency has energized the pursuit of alternative designs, enabling greater flexibility in supply chain, manufacturing, storage, and maintenance considerations. To achieve this, we hypothesized that using the medical gasses and flow interruption strategy would allow for a high performance, low cost, functional ventilator. A low-cost ventilator designed and built-in accordance with the Emergency Use guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is presented wherein pressurized medical grade gases enter the ventilator and time limited flow interruption determines the ventilator rate and tidal volume. This simple strategy obviates the need for many components needed in traditional ventilators, thereby dramatically shortening the time from storage to clinical deployment, increasing reliability, while still providing life-saving ventilatory support. The overall design philosophy and its applicability in this new crisis is described, followed by both bench top and animal testing results used to confirm the precision, safety and reliability of this low cost and novel approach to mechanical ventilation. The ventilator meets and exceeds the critical requirements included in the FDA emergency use guidelines. The ventilator has received emergency use authorization from the FDA.

abstract={The recent studies on hydrogen supply chain (HSC) explicitly state that optimising the HSC flows is one of the main elements leads to have an efficient hydrogen supply network and plays a vital role in total costs minimisation of hydrogen production and transportation. Considering the importance of this issue, this study presents a mathematical programming optimisation model to help the HSC managers make robust strategic and tactical decisions related to HSC management. Generally, the HSC echelons include gathering raw material centres, production facilities and hydrogen distribution and storage centres. The proposed approach introduces a mix-integer linear programming (MILP) model optimising the HSC network at the strategic level of decision-making through minimising both capital and operational costs of the HSC. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is accomplished on the transportation cost of materials within the HSC network which constitutes the major share of total costs. Moreover, a numerical example is performed to demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the proposed optimisation model. The obtained results confirm the capability of the presented model for HSC network optimisation. The main finding of the research indicated that hydrogen transportation cost is completely sensitive to HSC network structure. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={In supply chain management sustainability is often neglected or only addressed in a disconnected fashion. Traditionally the main aims of a supply chain are of an economic nature, i.e. to provide high service levels at the lowest possible cost. Social and environmental dimensions are usually not considered as part of comprehensive supply chain strategy. Rising consumer awareness and stricter governmental regulations are driving factors that force companies to extend the sustainability concept into their supply chains. Integral supply chain concepts like Just-In-Time, outsourcing, offshoring, small batch sizes and frequent deliveries appear to be incompatible with an integrated sustainability approach. This research addresses several associated problems in three interconnected steps. Firstly, key issues in supply chain management have to be identified. Secondly, trade-offs between economic, environmental, and social goals have to be assessed. Finally, these findings have to be formulated into an integrated approach that outlines how supply chains can adapt key operational issues to support a holistic sustainability strategy. The developed artefacts leverage and integrate features from established frameworks and may be used in a prescriptive manner to support sustainability within supply chains. © Common Ground, Hendrik Reefke, David Sundaram, All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Unfortunately, we must admit that we discovered an error in our previous calculation. The work that we presented had an error related to the GH2 truck-supplied fuel station. In our script, we highlighted that the model includes additional trailer costs at the fuelling station under the assumption that the trailer serves as low pressure storage. Unfortunately, the model did not factor this cost into the fueling station's cost as intended, and thereby underestimated the specific cost of hydrogen for gaseous trailer-supplied fueling stations by 0.34€/kWh. This influences the costs noted in to Figs. 6–9 and 14. The new figures are shown below: Fig. 6.

abstract={A viable hydrogen infrastructure is one of the main challenges for fuel cells in mobile applications. Several studies have investigated the most cost-efficient hydrogen supply chain structure, with a focus on hydrogen transportation. However, supply chain models based on hydrogen produced by electrolysis require additional seasonal hydrogen storage capacity to close the gap between fluctuation in renewable generation from surplus electricity and fuelling station demand. To address this issue, we developed a model that draws on and extends approaches in the literature with respect to long-term storage. Thus, we analyse Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) and show their potential impact on future hydrogen mobility. We demonstrate that LOHC-based pathways are highly promising especially for smaller-scale hydrogen demand and if storage in salt caverns remains uncompetitive, but emit more greenhouse gases (GHG) than other gaseous or hydrogen ones. Liquid hydrogen as a seasonal storage medium offers no advantage compared to LOHC or cavern storage since lower electricity prices for flexible operation cannot balance the investment costs of liquefaction plants. A well-to-wheel analysis indicates that all investigated pathways have less than 30% GHG-emissions compared to conventional fossil fuel pathways within a European framework. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={This paper presents a two-stage stochastic programming model to design a green supply chain in a carbon trading environment. The model solves a discrete location problem and determines the optimal material flows and the number of carbon credits/allowances traded. The study contributes to the existing literature by incorporating uncertainty in carbon price and product demand. The proposed model is applied to a real world case study and the numerical results are carefully analyzed and interpreted. We find that the supply chain configuration can be highly sensitive to the probability distribution of the carbon credit price. More importantly, we observe that carbon price and budget availability for supply chain reconfiguration can both have a positive but nonlinear relationship with greening of the supply chain. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={In today’s business environment, data analytics capability has gained popularity among organizations as a source of competitive advantage. Furthermore, due to the current business outsourcing, supply chain management is known to be an extremely challenging task. Most previous studies focused on the relationship between data analytics capability and competitive advantage regardless of the role of organizational characteristics, particularly supply chain resilience. This paper aimed to assess the impact of data analytics capability on competitive advantage in the textile industry concerning the mediating role of supply chain resilience and organizational flexibility. To this end, a new conceptual model was developed to investigate the relationships and partial least squares–structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied for analysis. The population of this study comprised 450 qualified persons and four well-known brands of sleep products. In addition, a pilot survey was conducted with 30 respondents before the questionnaire was used for the final survey. Based on the results, data analytics capability positively affected competitive advantage, supply chain resilience, and organizational flexibility. Additionally, supply chain resilience and organizational flexibility played mediating roles in the relationship between data analytics capability and competitive advantage. Finally, some management insights are presented that are of interest to top managers. However, the results of this study were limited to the area of the textile industry (sleeping goods manufacturers) in Iran in order to maintain the uniformity of the research constructs. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Today's supply chains are very different from those of just a few years ago, and they continue to evolve within an extremely competitive economy. Dynamic supply chain processes require a technology that can cope with their increasing complexity. In recent years, several functional supply chain applications based on artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged, yet very few studies have addressed the applications of AI in supply chain processes. Machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics are all potential enablers of supply chain transformation. Aware of the potential advantages of AI implementation in supply chains and of the paucity of work done regarding it, we explore what researchers have done so far with respect to AI and what needs further exploration. We reviewed 136 research papers published between 1996 and 2020 from the Scopus database and provided a classification of the research material according to four critical structural dimensions (level of analytics, AI algorithms or techniques, sector or industry of application, and supply chain processes). This study is the first attempt to study the AI applications in SC from a process perspective and provides a decisional framework for adequate use of AI techniques in the different SC processes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Changes in consumer behavior are forcing companies to rapidly shift their distribution channels toward an omnichannel model. In the case of the ophthalmology sector, however, the purchase of contact lenses and prescription glasses requires professional examination by a trained eye specialist. This peculiarity of the sector affects the shift toward omnichannel. This paper is novel in that it addresses a research gap by studying the distribution channels for regulated products and services such as health products that required a closer professional service. This paper addresses the transformation of companies toward an omnichannel model using a common scientific forecasting method (i.e., the Delphi method) to identify trends and problems. In this scenario of high complexity and uncertainty where there is insufficient relevant quantitative information for decision making, the Delphi method is applied to ensure a consensual decision-making process. Consensus was reached by a panel of 11 experts on the Spanish ophthalmology sector after three rounds of questioning. The final set of indicators involve 19 different criteria grouped into four categories (1) current situation of the distribution channel, (2) changes in distribution channels, (3) trends and near future of the distribution channel, and (4) consequences and adaptations for supply chain agents. The results from each round of consultation were then analyzed by means of statistical analysis with SPSS and discussed for each category. The results confirm that traditional intermediaries face difficulties to avoid being squeezed out of the sector because of shortening distribution channels and the entry of new online intermediaries with service integration models. We identify future scenarios and define actions that different agents can take to enhance their competitiveness in the short and long term. The arrival of omnichannel distribution is inevitable in the ophthalmology sector, entailing a major transformation from a rigid traditional distribution model to a more complex and flexible model following the entry of new online intermediaries. © Copyright © 2020 Rivero Gutiérrez and Samino García.},

abstract={Almost 20 years ago, Marshall L. Fisher asked on the Harvard Business Review "What is the right supply chain for your product?" To search for an answer, he proposed a matrix to understand if the nature of a company's products and the priority of its supply chain match or not. The aim of this work is to determine quantitatively the level of strategic fit of Italian companies from different sectors (e.g. automotive, rubber and plastics, fashion and apparel and machineries and equipment). To achieve our goal, we built a multiple-choice questionnaire with 11 questions on a company's supply chain and 9 questions on its products, to determine products characteristics and supply chain priorities. Also, the questionnaire is provided with some general questions to describe the characteristics of the company. The questionnaire was sent to around 2,000 companies, and we received 172 answers. Firstly, we built the Fisher matrix, and found out that around 61% of companies resulted to match supply chain priorities with product's characteristics. Around 27% of companies, instead, presented a responsive supply chain with functional products, and another 12% of companies have an efficient supply chain with innovative products: both these solutions present criticalities. Finally, we investigated the degree of coherence of the different sectors, and this produces interesting suggestions, both for researchers and practitioners.},

The false positive rate and true positive rates are established for various organizational structures and compared to a basic tree. This study provides a baseline understanding for the accuracy that can be expected when discovering organizational networks using these techniques.

abstract={Supply networks existing today in many industries can behave as complex adaptive systems making them more difficult to analyze and assess. Being able to fully understand both the complex static and dynamic structures of a complex adaptive supply network (CASN) are key to being able to make more informed management decisions and prioritize resources and production throughout the network. Previous efforts to model and analyze CASN have been impeded by the complex, dynamic nature of the systems. However, drawing from other complex adaptive systems sciences, information theory provides a model-free methodology removing many of those barriers, especially concerning complex network structure and dynamics. With minimal information about the network nodes, transfer entropy can be used to reverse engineer the network structure while local transfer entropy can be used to analyze the network structure's dynamics. Both simulated and real-world networks were analyzed using this methodology. Applying the methodology to CASNs allows the practitioner to capitalize on observations from the highly multidisciplinary field of information theory which provides insights into CASN's self-organization, emergence, stability/instability, and distributed computation. This not only provides managers with a more thorough understanding of a system's structure and dynamics for management purposes, but also opens up research opportunities into eventual strategies to monitor and manage emergence and adaption within the environment. © 2016 by the authors.},

abstract={Information-theoretic principles can be applied to the study of complex adaptive supply networks (CASN). Previous modeling efforts of CASN were impeded by the complex, dynamic nature of the systems. However, information theory provides a model-free approach to the problem removing many of those barriers. Understanding how principles such as transfer entropy, excess entropy/predictive information, information storage, and separable information apply in the context of supply networks opens up new ways of studying these complex systems. Additionally, these principles provide the potential for new business analytics which give managers of CASN new insights into the system's health, behavior, and eventual control strategies.},

abstract={Parts backorder reduction has become increasingly important in supply chain management.When it is difficult or time consuming to acquire parts, the operational availability of a system is reduced. This study describes a technique that helps planners proactively identify potential problem spare parts to better manage spare parts acquisition in military weapon systems. The paper reports on the results of fuzzy induced linguistic ordered weighted averaging for group decision support evaluation of backorder risk triggers to ensure that equipment is available and fully operational when needed. Risk factors were identified, the impact importance and probability metric performance ratings were determined via induced linguistic ordered weighted averaging, and a risk mitigation strategy was used to identify and predict supply chain backorder risk triggers (SCBORT). L-Project is an illustrative example that utilizes Petri nets and Pareto charts to present the evaluation hierarchy of supply chain risk. Cluster analysis is utilized to determine that there are five triggers of engineering, obsolescence, demand, NSN unique sustainment, and cataloging in light of the five SCBORT probability performance metric dimensions of quality, cost, lead time, service level, and information availability. There are also four aggregated SCBORT impact clusters of market sensitiveness, process integration, information drivers, and flexibility.

abstract={Recently, supply chain operations have been influenced by three concepts such as sustainable supply chain, dynamic capabilities, and disruptive innovation. First, sustainability has become a necessary goal for businesses and a powerful strategy for competitive advantage. Sustainable innovations along the supply chain are increasingly important regarding firm competitiveness to respond to rapid changes in the market. Secondly, disruptive innovations are particularly adopted by firms, because they aim to provide product or process to a new set of customers (or customers with new sets of requirements). Big data and predictive analytics are one of them and may have the ability to generate considerably more business and social value while significantly reducing the use of scarce resources. This disruptive innovation could improve the ability to help with the sustainability of sourcing decisions, and reduce environmental footprint are increasingly recognized. Thirdly, developing dynamic capabilities such as absorptive capacity both in firms and in supply chains are also integral to responding to dynamic markets and customer needs. Dynamic capabilities are collective resources (financial and technical assets coordinated with knowledge and competencies) which are essentially change-oriented, helping firms redeploy and reconfigure. Any innovation (whether process or product oriented) must then rely on such capabilities. The main objective of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework through a literature review, to identify the features of disruptive innovations applied to the sustainable supply chain, and to analyze the role of dynamic capabilities. We will focus on how certain dynamic capabilities such as absorptive capacity affect the impact of the utilization of big data analytics on sustainable supply chain on frugal processes, which has not been investigated in depth. © 2017 DEStech Publications.

abstract={This paper presents how to objectively set up the process for activation of the future action plans from a supply chain Balanced Scorecard (BSC), aligning such an activation process to reach the main objectives and being able to save resources. Additionally, it also shows how to define supply chain business scenarios based on the future expected values of the Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Once the future business scenario has been chosen, the KPI values associated with this scenario will become the new KPI values of the BSC in order to align efforts and save resources Further, the strategic objectives associated with the KPIs may also be extensively retuned, thus redefining their target values. From the application carried out, there were four KPIs whose values needed, in absolute terms, to be increased and four other KPIs to be decreased. Additionally, the associated strategic objectives were retuned; for example, the value of the strategic objective “To reduce product development costs” was initially set in the BSC at 10 % but it was deduced to 8% as a consequence of the application of the proposal. As a result, this methodology has aligned all the future efforts of a whole supply chain in order to reach one point on a plane, which is a combination of interrelated supply chain KPI. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: There can be many negative effects from a disruption in a central node of companies' supply chains, such as a port conflict that reduces capacity. Strategies for disruption management include flexibility and redundancy. This paper aims to analyse a supply chain disruption from flexibility and capacity perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: A case study was conducted of the supply chain disruption caused by the port conflict in 2016–2017 in Gothenburg, in which the port operated at a reduced capacity. Companies importing and exporting goods, freight forwarders, hauliers, train operators, ports, shipping companies and their agents were interviewed. Findings: Various capacity problems (ports, links, container chassis, empty containers) were encountered due to the port conflict. Flexibility measures such as node, mode and fleet flexibility can be used in response to changes in capacity. Difficulties with applying flexibility are discussed. Research limitations/implications: Although based on a Swedish case, findings are relevant for disruptions or other types of disturbances in ports elsewhere and also in other important nodes in companies' supply chains. Practical implications: Actors influenced by disturbances in a port can increase their understanding of potential capacity problems and flexibility measures. Readiness and timely action are important due to competition regarding capacity. Originality/value: The implications on the transport network surrounding a port, including many actors, are explained, illustrating how capacity problems propagate, but there is some flexibility to manage the problems. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Although a responsive supply chain is an integral part of order-winning manufacturing strategies, it has not been clear how firms build a responsive supply chain in global manufacturing environments. Built upon a synthesis of the existing literature and relevant theories, this paper presents a research model that defines the drivers, strategy, and practices of a responsive supply chain and the performance outcomes. This paper is one of the rare empirical studies that identify key variables relevant to the implementation of a successful responsive supply chain. The effective implementation of a responsive supply chain requires a careful definition of a responsive supply chain strategy in terms of the product range, and the frequency and innovativeness of the product offerings. Firms also need to provide key implementation practices (i.e.; sharing of information with customers, collaboration with suppliers, use of advanced manufacturing technology) to achieve pull production to achieve responsiveness to the market. This study also suggests that the key contextual factors that influence the extent of implementation of a responsive supply chain strategy are mostly the size of firms, industry characteristics, and customer and supplier bases, rather than the location of manufacturing firms. This paper shows that the effective implementation of a responsive supply chain strategy involves the integration of inter-organizational resources (i.e.; socio-relational and techno-process integration) across the global supply chain to enhance pull production capabilities. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Building and deploying network capabilities of firms are crucial for sustaining competitive advantage. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are useful to enhance such network capabilities thorough effective information flows. Their intended goals are measured in terms of production costs, operational flexibility and supply chain performance outcomes. However, the impact of ERP system implementation on firm performance has been reported as somewhat inconclusive. This study contends that a missing link in the story is the scope and extent of ERP system implementation after investigating how the extent of ERP integration is associated with the performance outcomes of manufacturing firms. The study also posits that restructuring in the organisation and supply chains are positively associated with manufacturing performance. Since ERP often entails restructuring in an organisation and supply chains, it is anticipated that restructuring plays an important role in inducing positive impact of ERP implementation to the firm. Using a global sample of 641 manufacturers, this research identifies four distinct ERP systems integration patterns, epitomised by different extents and directions of integration, and finds a significant association among the broadest degree of ERP systems integration, restructuring and plant performance improvement. The empirical results also show that restructuring takes place most actively in a firm that implement ERP with widest scope and scale. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the relationship between environmental dynamism and supply chain flexibility (SCF) and to evaluate if two dynamic capabilities, i.e. operational absorptive capacity (OAC) and organisational learning (OL), are necessary competences for firms to develop such a responsive supply chain strategy as flexibility. Design/methodology/approach: Hypothesised relationships are tested with survey data from 302 Spanish manufacturing firms using structural equations modelling. Findings: Environmental dynamism is positively associated with both OAC and OL, and both dynamic capabilities enable SCF. The authors also find that the relationship between environmental dynamism and SCF is partially mediated by both dynamic capabilities. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the literature, for example, by determining when it is advantageous to develop SCF, by specifying what capabilities a firm needs to develop to align SCF with the environment, and by opening the black box that is the relationship between the environment and SCF. Practical implications: Managers should develop SCF via OAC and OL when they detect a high degree of environmental dynamism. Knowing when this is necessary relies on a good understanding of the environment. OAC is found to be a stronger enabler of SCF than OL. The findings provide managers with an insight into why some firms are able to develop more effective responses to dynamic environments than others. Originality/value: This study is one of only a limited number of studies that adopt a dynamic capabilities approach to supply chain management. Prior literature has shown that dynamic capabilities can aid in developing strategic, structural, and operational flexibility. The authors extend this literature by showing that OAC and OL have an effect on SCF. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether supply chain (SC) ambidexterity improves supply chain flexibility (SCF) and its impact on SC competence and firm performance. A new measurement instrument for SCF is proposed that takes into account the demands of the environment: SCF fit. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model is developed to examine the relationships proposed. The hypotheses are tested with data from 302 manufacturing firms using a structural equations model methodology. Findings: The results show that SC ambidexterity helps to achieve the optimal level of SCF and that supply chain management (SCM) is important to firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper makes three contributions to the SCM literature: first, it develops the conceptual definition of SC ambidexterity and studies its effects at the SC level; second, it develops a new instrument to measure SCF known as SCF fit; third, it studies both the impact of SCF fit on SC competence and the importance of SC in firm performance. Practical implications: This paper develops a measurement instrument that permits managers to diagnose the level of SCF and the correspondence/gap between current and optimal levels and to establish comparisons between different SC. It also indicates the importance of SCM for firm performance and the need to consider the SC as a whole. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies to analyze ambidexterity in an organizational network like the SC. It shows that exploitation practices do not jeopardize SCF as long as they are accompanied by exploration practices. That is, high levels of exploration and exploitation are compatible in the SC and lead to the optimal level of SCF. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Supply chain flexibility (SCF) has become an important competitive weapon for companies in the current dynamic environment. This paper explores the influence of ambidexterity on supply chain flexibility (SCF) and theorizes the moderating effect of information technology (IT) competence on that relationship. Whereas prior research focuses on the positive results of SCF for business performance, little empirical research has studied its facilitators, leaving the gap this study seeks to fill. We draw on resource orchestration theory to develop our research model. According to this theory, a firm can exploit the full potential of its resources and capabilities only when these are deployed in a complementary manner. This study proposes that ambidexterity impacts SCF positively and that its effect is amplified when the firm possesses IT competence. In order to test our hypotheses we have employed a hierarchical regression methodology and put into service data collected from manufacturing enterprises. The study confirms that ambidexterity, as the ability to explore and exploit SC resources, enables their orchestration, making SC resources flexible, and a high IT competence facilitates that orchestration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Purpose: To analyze the effect of an ambidextrous supply chain strategy (ASCS) – i.e. the combination of exploration and exploitation practices – on each of the four dimensions of supply chain flexibility (SCF): information system, operating system, sourcing and distribution flexibility. Further, to evaluate the influence of implementing the ISO 9001 standard on the relationship between ASCS and SCF, and whether this certification directly affects the level of SCF. We ground our model in Resource Orchestration theory. Design/methodology/approach: To perform this study, the authors used data collected from a sample of 145 non-ISO-certified firms and 157 ISO-certified firms. Findings: ASCS does not affect all four dimensions of SCF in the same way. Rather, its effect is contingent on the presence of the ISO 9001 certification. An ASCS is shown to have a positive effect on information system flexibility irrespective of the presence of ISO 9001 certification whereas for the other three dimensions of SCF, the effect of ASCS is dependent on ISO 9001 implementation. Meanwhile, ISO 9001 implementation itself does not affect the level of SCF. Practical implications: Managers can use the findings to configure their supply chain strategy based on the specific dimension(s) of SCF they seek to develop by implementing ASCS. Further, the results inform managers about the incentives for implementing ISO 9001. Originality/value: Although prior studies have shown that an ambidextrous strategy enables firms and organizational units to adapt to the environment, there have been few prior studies on ambidexterity in a supply chain context. Further, although the extant literature has suggested that the ISO 9001 may facilitate ambidexterity, this link has remained largely theoretical. In fact, there is very little prior evidence on how the practice of ISO 9001 affects the supply chain. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The new generation of network-based organizations has triggered the emergence of distributed and more complex contexts for the analysis of firms' strategies. This gradual change in the way we understand enterprises has induced radical evolutions on the Quality Management domain. As a consequence, the Problem Solving Methodologies (PSM) widely used in industry and positioned up to now as one of the key elements for achieving continuous improvement efforts within local scopes are now insufficient to deal with major and distributed problems and requirements in this new environment. The definition of a generic and collaborative PSM well-adapted to supply chain contexts is one of the purposes of this paper. Additional requirements linked to specificities carried out by the introduction of a networked context within the methodology scope, the relational aspects of the supply chains, complexity and distribution of information, distributed decision-making processes and knowledge management challenges are some of the aspects being addressed by the proposed methodology. A special focus is made on benefits obtained through the integration of those elements across all problem-solving phases and particularly a proposal for multi-level root-cause analysis articulating both horizontal and vertical decision processes of supply chains is presented. In addition to laying out the expected benefits of such a methodology in the Quality Management area, the article studies the reuse of all the quality-related evidence capitalized in series phase as a driver for improving upstream phases of product development projects. This paper addresses this link between series and development activities in light of the proposed PSM and intends to encourage discussion on the definition of new approaches for Quality Management throughout the whole product lifecycle. Some enabling elements in the decision-making processes linked to both the problemsolving in series phase and the roll-out of new products are introduced.},

abstract={A surge in tariffs poses an enormous challenge to the development of multinational green supply chains, which could be mitigated by altruistic preferences and government subsidies. By developing a Stackelberg game analytical framework and designing different scenarios, we deduce the stakeholder’s optimal solutions in each case and compare them to evaluate the impact of manufacturer altruistic preferences and government subsidies on the multinational green supply chain under dynamic tariff. Then we show that: (i) with the increasing tariff rates, either altruistic preferences or government subsidies can promote the green supply chain. (ii) No matter what strategy adopts in the supply chain, it is beneficial to the retailer while harmful to the manufacturer with altruistic preference. (iii) Government subsidies or altruism preferences will lead to free-riding, but the former is conducive to the stable supply chain. (iv) Compared with the production cost subsidy, the green R&D subsidy encourages the green level, but the former contributes to increasing the participant profits. (v) Subsidies and altruistic preference, which simultaneously work in the supply chain, will further boost the greening but aggravate the manufacturer's loss and destroy the supply chain stability. To further enhance the green level and the participant revenue, we also propose the contracts of two-part tariff and profit-sharing to coordinate the supply chain. Lastly, we perform a comparative analysis of the different scenarios utilizing numerical examples and formulate managerial insights accordingly. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={This article investigates the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and their proactive mediation by adaptive operational decisions in different network design structures in anticipation of and during the pandemic. In generalized terms, we contribute to the understanding of the effect of preparedness and recovery decisions in a pandemic setting on supply chain operations and performance. In particular, we examine the impact of inventory pre-positioning in anticipation of a pandemic and the adaptation of production-ordering policy during the pandemic. Our model combines three levels, which is not often seen jointly in operations management literature, i.e., pandemic dynamics, supply chain design, and operational production-inventory control policies. The analysis is performed for both two- and three-stage supply chains and different scenarios for pandemic dynamics (i.e., uncontrolled propagation or controlled dispersal with lockdowns). Our findings suggest that two-stage supply chains exhibit a higher vulnerability in disruption cases. However, they are exposed to a lower system inertia and show positive effects at the recovery stage. Supply chain adaptation ahead of a pandemic is more advantageous than during the pandemic when specific operational recovery policies are deployed. We show that it is instructive to avoid simultaneous changes in structural network design and operational policies since that can destabilize the production-inventory system and result in higher product shortages. © 2022},

abstract={Material production drives an increasingly large fraction of CO2-equivalent emissions. Material efficiency strategies such as recycling serve to reduce these emissions. Current analyses of the effectiveness of such strategies do not include economically induced rebound effects, overestimating the associated environmental benefits. We present a dynamic supply chain simulation model for copper through 2040 incorporating inventory-driven price evolution, dynamic material flow analysis, and life cycle assessment alongside mine-level economic evaluation of opening, closing, and production decisions. We show that permanent increases in recycling displace ∼0.5 kilotonnes mine production per kilotonne increase in scrap supply on average, while short-lived recycling policies can lead to increased mine production. We find evidence for supply chain evolution pathways minimizing the rebound effect and maximizing displacement of primary material, where increasing refined copper and concentrate prices and decreasing demand serve to decrease mining. However, even in best-case scrap supply scenarios, CO2e emissions from the copper sector increase 25% by 2040 relative to 2018 due to demand growth, ore grade decline, and lower displacement among large scrap supply changes. With implementation of best available technologies across all supply chain components, we estimated 2040 CO2e emissions 10% below those of 2018 are possible, though still well short of 2°C emissions targets. We find increasing mine taxes and royalties, reclamation costs, and exploration costs further increase displacement, as does the inclusion of scrap prices on major futures exchanges. These results highlight the importance of considering the economics of the entire material supply chain when implementing material efficiency strategies.

abstract={Supply chain (SC) is a dynamic process that entails a continuous flow of information, materials and funds across multiple functional areas, within and between chain members in order to meet customer's requirements and to maximize their profit. Such dynamic process requires instantaneous acquisition and constant re-evaluation of partners, technologies and organizational structures. However, firms may encounter problems related to the dynamic process. Petroleum companies, in this globalization era are one of the dynamic supply chain entities, which require dynamic processes of capabilities, due to their high degree of uncertainties. Motivated by the complexity of uncertainty in the petroleum companies and its typical characteristic of SC, this study intends to understand the process of dynamic SC management. Using the resource-based view and organizational learning theory as the basis for developing the framework of the study, this study aimed to identify and understand the process of dynamic SC capabilities. Company in oil and gas in Malaysia will be chosen as the sample case in understanding the process of the dynamic SC capabilities and SC performance. Due to the subjectivity of the study that requires understanding process of SC, this study proposes to employ interpretive paradigm where it would guide towards rigour qualitative methodology. This study will provide rich and thick description of the dynamic of SC where the outcome will contribute to the managerial and theoretical perspective of SC management in oil and gas industry. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to define the "fast evolving industry" (FEI) and its supply chain management (SCM) challenges. The authors review and structure the literature regarding integration strategies and implementation methods to develop a strategic decision-making framework for SCM in the FEI. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conduct a review of SCM literature, including supply chain strategy, supply chain integration (SCI), agile and responsive supply chain and SCM for innovative and fastchanging industries. The authors develop a conceptual model and a decision-making framework and use four mini cases to provide support for the model and framework. Findings - The FEI, characterised by a high level of innovation and differentiation, short products/services lifecycle and high variety, is yet to be fully defined. Inherent uncertainty in FEI supply systems makes SCM in these industries a complex but strategic task for their managers. The framework and the model offered in this study, which employ a core competency concept and provide risk management strategies, offer a strategic tool for managers and scholars in the field to optimise their integration strategies and to operationalise integration decisions. Originality/value - Little research has been published on transferable and cross-industrial SCM in FEIs. This paper defines the FEI and its resource-related concerns and then offers a conceptual model and a strategic decision-making framework for SCI in FEIs. © 2017 Sabet, Yazdani, De Leeuw.},

A multi-cut L-shaped solution approach is developed to solve the proposed model. Data from a real case problem in the paint industry is utilised to test the model and solution approach. Important managerial insights are obtained from the case study. Our analyses focus on (1) exploring the relationship between supply chain cost and customer service level, (2) examining the impacts of different types of disruptions on the total cost, (3) evaluating the utility of resilience strategies, (4) investigating the benefits of the proposed solution approach to solve problems of different sizes and (5) benchmarking the performance of the proposed stochastic programming approach. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Nowadays, innovation is increasingly growing and the lifetime of products is decreasing. In this situation, New Product Development (NPD) is an advantage that makes it possible to survive in the competitive market. However, risks are unavoidable in NPD in any industry. Therefore, identifying, management, and mitigation of risks are considered of high significance for companies. By taking risk management into account, this study introduces a new multi-objective mathematical model for Supply Chain (SC) configuration in the presence of a new product. The considered SC is multi-echelon, multi-resource, multi-period, and multi-product. In order to manage the risk in this SC, appropriate mitigation strategies were chosen among various risk response strategies considering their cost and effectiveness. Furthermore, inuence of each choice on SC was accounted for in the mathematical model. The assumed model explored the optimum tactical and operational Supply Chain Management (SCM) decisions. The ability of the model was assessed by solving a numerical example. The result showed that the choice of various response strategies as well as new product production inuenced SC configuration. © 2020 Sharif University of Technology.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present green supply chain, resilient supply chain, agile supply chain, cold supply chain and lean supply chain (GRACL SC) procedures based on a detailed perspective, analyzing subjects in the past 19 years with a systematic literature review (SLR) of the papers reported from 2000 to 2019, and offering information and guidelines for further studies. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on 17 keywords in the title and topic of the articles and collects data from Web of Science (WOS) databases and objectively chooses 1,190 articles and performs meta-data analyses. Tables and statistical reports are based on the following three filters: publication year, authors and document type. At least, 39 publications from the ISI WOS has been examined for presenting information of categorization of the conducted research with regard to the content analysis, comprising the conceptual development and obstacles, cooperation with the supply chain elements, as well as mathematical and other optimization models. Findings: Finally, this study answered three main questions in the research and demonstrates that the majority studies in the green supply chain (GSC) and a minimum number of studies on the cold supply chain have been conducted and 27 factors are chosen to achieve the 2000 to 2019 GRACL SCM model which robust and fit for Iranian food industries. The model shows that the agile, resilient and lean supply chain have direct effect on GSC and it can be said that all 27 groups which are selected for the final model of this research can be the main groups in the supply chain. Originality/value: This paper was actually conducted by authors who reported it. To prevent plagiarized, redoubled efforts have been made and actually this paper is based on SLR methodology and the results are real and the researcher discusses the results appropriately. This investigation can have a positive impact within the field of expanding supply chain flexibility and lessening squander within the Iranian generation framework. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Supply chains suffer from serious vulnerabilities and disruptions with increasing global crises, including pandemics and natural disasters. Dynamic and complex supply chain environments have constantly led companies to modern management approaches such as resilience to address disruptions. Besides, the sustainability approach enhances the strength of the supply chain in disruptions by considering economic, social, and environmental aspects. This paper develops a mathematical model for designing a supply chain network considering resilience and sustainability. In this model, suppliers were exposed to disruption with different probabilities. The model has three objectives: minimizing total costs and maximizing suppliers' social and environmental scores. A robust scenario-based stochastic programming approach has been used for potential disruption scenarios. The multiobjective model is solved by the ϵ-constraint method in GAMS software. The numerical results show the performance of the model in a different situation. Also, the robust scenario-based stochastic programming approach allows the average performance of the supply chain in each objective to improve. © 2021 Zahra Sadeghi et al.},

abstract={Supply chain is a network of different business units which focuses on integration among all units in order to produce and distribute end products to the customer. Nowadays, due to increased uncertainty in customer demand, it is necessary to be sure that the supply chain networks operate as efficient as possible in order to satisfy the customer demand at the lowest cost. Enhancing the efficiency of the supply chain necessitates the interaction between different members of the supply chain which can be achieved through supply chain management. Hence, the development of modeling approach in order to understand and analyze the dynamic behavior of supply chains is brought into consideration. This paper proposes a system dynamic simulation model for manufacturing supply chain. System dynamic is used as suitable method to understand and analyze the interactions of various components via feedback structure. The objective of this paper is to simulate the manufacturing supply chain of an electronic manufacturing company in Malaysia. The simulation model is used to study the system's behavior (in terms of production rate, inventory levels, and backlog orders) under two different operational conditions (named as fixed and varied capacity policies) and compare their efficiency in terms of total cost. The analysis shows that the proposed operational condition, which is varied capacity policy, improves the system efficiency in terms of cost. © 2014 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Owing to increased access to the Internet and the development of electronic commerce, e-commerce has become a common method of shopping in all countries. The purpose of this study is more precisely to research e-commerce diversity in Europe at the regional level and develop the conception of “E-commerce Supply Chain Management”. Statistical data derived from the European Statistical Office were applied to analyse the spatial diversity of e-retailing. Assessments of the regional diversity of e-retailing applied geographic information systems and exploratory spatial data analysis methods such us global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics. Clusters of regions with similar household preferences related to online shopping were identified. A spatial visualisation of the e-retailing diversity phenomenon may be utilised for the reconfiguration of supply chains and to adapt them to actual household preferences related to shopping methods. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: In a volatile marketplace, warehouse management is fundamentally contingent of changes in its supply network environment. Flexibility is therefore a key logistics issue in distribution centre management. This study probes into the nature of warehouse flexibility in a supply network through simulation. Design/methodology/approach: By using the FlexSim simulation tool the dynamic behaviour of the warehouse system are conceptualised, documented, simulated, analysed and evaluated. Findings: Simulation revealed that external changes affect daily processes and the reorganisation of warehouse processes. Given the extensity of resource use, simulation also revealed that process reorganisation should not be a daily undertaking. This is because warehouse processes react in unpredictable and different manners to even the smallest disturbance from the environment. This reaction is not necessarily negative impending more long-term change of warehouse processes. Originality/value: The warehouse is a complex system that self-adapts with limited need to calculate new optimised warehouse processes to counter changes in its environment. Rather than following deterministic optimisation procedures, the development of flexible resources is a key issue in warehouse management. The applied simulation model is generic and therefore applicable in other distribution centres pointing to how to monitor warehouse processes to in a pre-emptively develop warehouse flexibility through change of process context. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper aims to analyse the potential effects on bilateral trade movements of the reconfiguration of maritime networks brought about by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The gravity model of international trade is applied to examine the hypothesized impact of maritime network reconfiguration on the bilateral trade between nine exporting countries (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia) and their 128 trading partners. The panel data on the five components of the Liner Shipping Bilateral Connectivity Index, the export value, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the nine exporting countries, the GDP of their trading partners and the maritime distance linking them to these 128 trading partners for each of the years from 2008 to 2016 are used in the analysis. The results show that the estimated coefficient for the number of transhipments is negative, revealing an inverse relationship between transhipments and bilateral exports, reconfirming that a redesign of the maritime supply chain network in response to the BRI could significantly improve bilateral export values. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of required transhipments, because of a reconfiguration of maritime networks with BRI trading partners, will improve the maritime network structure between countries located along the three strategic chokepoints: the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, and the Strait of Malacca. In general terms, the BRI-driven reconfiguration of maritime supply networks is linked to an improvement in the productivity of nine exporting countries. An innovative gravity-based econometric model, estimated on a large set of panel data, is introduced below, aiming at the modelling of the effect of BRI on supply chain network reconfiguration. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Nowadays, business competition turns from inter-company competition into competition between supply networks (Rice and Hoppe, 2001) [1]. Winning customer satisfaction is one of the primary elements of survival in the market. Organizations are no longer committed to long-term cooperation with suppliers. Furthermore, choosing suppliers is only based on their qualifications with regard to providing service and their compatibility with the type of customers' demands. Thus, each supply network needs to be designed according to a specific market opportunity with regard to structure and members. As a result, the structure of supply networks must be more flexible and move toward dynamics (Humphries and Mena, 2012) [2]. Delivery time is one of the main criteria for evaluating the performance of a supply network. Delivery speed and accuracy in dynamic supply networks are the main challenges ahead of network managers due to the short-time nature of such networks (da Silveira and Arkader, 2007) [3]. Therefore, from a different viewpoint, uncertainty and its sources, which directly affect delivery time, could not be ignored easily. Therefore, this study essentially focuses on the impact of uncertainty on delivery time in three nodes supply networks. The aim of this paper is to identify the impact of the accumulation of the individual delivery time uncertainties on overall delivery time uncertainty. The idea is the type of network and their structures have a crucial impact on the delivery time uncertainty. To prove this idea a probabilistic method is created to measure and evaluate this influence by implementing the Markov theorem. This research is an important step toward the better understanding of more complex networks and the impact of network type in the delivery time uncertainty of these networks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={To increase resilience in supply chains, we investigate the optimal design of flexibility in a backup system. We model the dynamics of disruptions as Markov chains, and consider a multiproduct, multisupplier supply chain under dynamic disruption risks. Using our model, we first show that a little flexibility in the backup system can go a long way in mitigating dynamic disruption risks. This raises an important and fundamental question in designing flexibility in the backup system: to achieve the benefits of full backup flexibility, which unreliable suppliers should be backed up? To answer this question, we connect the supply chain to various queueing and dam models by analyzing the dynamics of the inventory shortfall process. Using this connection, we show that backing up suppliers merely based on first moment considerations such as their average reliability or average product demand can be misleading. All else equal, it is better to back up suppliers with (1) longer but less frequent disruptions, and (2) lower demand uncertainty. In addition to such second moment effects, by employing the Renyi's Theorem, we demonstrate that when disruptions are relatively long (if they occur), backing up the suppliers for which the expected wasted backup capacity is minimum provides the best backup flexibility design. We also develop easy-to-compute and yet effective indices that (a) guide the supply chain designer in deciding which suppliers to backup, and (b) provide insights into the role of various factors such as inventory holding and shortage costs, purchasing costs, suppliers reliabilities, and product demand distributions in designing backup flexibility. © 2016 INFORMS.},

The importance of information sharing in SCM is gradually increasing in terms of improving the business performance. In this study, an attempt to determine the effect of information sharing in the supply chain process (SCP) on cost, financial and business performance, in general, was made. The attempt was made by means of a measuring tool which is based on a theoretical approach. For this purpose, the structural equation model (SEM) was established by taking into account the supply chain structure, SCP, supply chain flexibility, environmental uncertainties and information sharing latent structures in businesses and the cost and financial performance indicators. In this study, differently from most other studies, two performance variables were included, and the model was created by defining these variables, which could be measured with more than one indicator, as latent variables. For this purpose, the data obtained from a questionnaire study performed on large firms within the scope of ISO 1000 were used. An attempt to reveal the factors affecting the cost and financial performance of businesses in SCM was made in the study. As a result of the analyses performed, the proposed SEM model was tested by taking into account various compliance criteria, and the validity and reliability of the model were determined. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Supply chain flexibility is considered as a major determinant of competitiveness in the global business market today. Flexibility is the organisation's ability to satisfy an increasing variety of customer expectations without excessive cost, time, organisational disruptions, or performance losses. Effective control of supply chain flexibility can improve overall organisational performance. The present study thus builds a group decision-making structural hierarchy model towards assessment as well as benchmarking of flexibility extent in supply chain management. This study presents a framework for evaluating supply chain flexibility through comprehensive analysis of past literature and identifies five elements (assessment indices) for characterising supply chain flexibility viz. supply network flexibility, operations systems flexibility, logistics process flexibility, information system flexibility, and organisational design flexibility. The subjectivity of the flexibility indices have been tackled through exploration of the concept of fuzzy logic; thus, enabling decision-making which involves linguistic expert judgment.

abstract={Business stability, quality, safety, supply chain flexibility and cost optimization have an increasing role in companies that strive to stay and survive in the market competition. A wise supplier choice becomes ever more important prerequisite for the success of any company. Inbound logistics is a vital step in warehouse receiving process and has a direct impact on supply chain cost and performance. As a result of an inefficient check-in operation, the incoming trucks may experience inordinate wait times between arrival and check-in, which in turn leads to unnecessary cost to the company in the form of detention fees (a penalty for holding the truck and driver beyond the agreed upon time) and delayed delivery of subsequent consignments. The goal is to minimize total cost by selecting the correct packaging type and the correct container for each part number. There are different costs associated with each option. Different check-in policies (staging area, dynamic dispatching rules, and automated technology) are proposed and compared to the current operations using discrete-event simulation models. In this proposed model, an inbound traditional trade automation framework is designed and implemented for real-time applications in order to reduce the cost and manual verification time. © 2019 SERSC.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework of integrated supply chain model that can be used to measure, evaluate and monitor operational performance under dynamic and uncertain conditions. Design/methodology/approach – The research methodology consists of two stages: configuration of a conceptual framework of integrated supply chain model linked with performance measures and illustration of the integrated supply chain model and delivery performance using a case of dairy industry. The integrated supply chain model is based on a unitary structuring technique and forms the basis for measuring and evaluating supply chain performance. Delivery performance with variation of demand (forecast and actual) is monitored using a fuzzy-based decision support system, based on three inputs: capacity utilization (influenced by production disruption), raw materials shortage and quality of dairy products. Findings – Integration of supply chain components (materials, resources, operations, activities, suppliers, etc.) of key processes using unitary structuring approach enables information integration in real time for performance evaluation and monitoring in complex supply chain situations. In addition, real-time performance monitoring is recognized as being of great importance for supply chain management in responding to uncertainties inherent in the operational environment. Research limitations/implications – Implementation of an integrated model requires maintenance of supply chain components with all necessary data and information in a system environment such as enterprise resource planning. Practical implications – The integrated model provides decision-makers with an overall view of supply chain components and direct links that need to be maintained for supply chain performance evaluation and monitoring. Wider adaptation and diffusion of the proposed model require further validation of the model and feasibility of implementation, using real-time data and information on selected performance measures. Originality/value – Integration of supply chain components across supply chain processes directly linked with performance measures is a novel approach for effective supply chain performance evaluation and monitoring in complex supply chains under dynamic and uncertain conditions. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The supply chains today face the ever increasing threats to its operations from the frequent disruptions. There is an urgent need to devise the methods to mitigate the effects of these disruptions on the performance of supply chains. Sharing information amongst the players in a chain is considered to be the best method currently to do so. This helps all the players in the chain to be abreast of the risks faced by the chain from various sources. This up to date information helps the companies in the chain to take the effective actions to guard from risks. This paper, by studying the effect of sharing the forecasting information on the performance of dynamic supply chain during disruptions, is an important effort towards making the supply chain resilient. The supply chain is modelled on the lines of the famous beer game scenario and is simulated by subjecting it to frequent demand and supply disruptions. The forecast sharing is tested at different levels, ranging from sharing between just conjugate players to sharing the retailer data with all the players, and the results show that even less amount of sharing the forecasted information helps the chain to improve its performance.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this research is to develop a conceptual framework in which dynamic capabilities (DCs) for the creation of logistics flexibility are outlined, and elaborate it further based on empirical data from a case study at a Swedish fast fashion retailer. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual framework that aims to delineate the relationship between generic classes of DCs and logistics flexibility is proposed. Thereafter, based on a theory elaboration approach, empirical data from a case study at a Swedish fast fashion retailer is used to identify more specific DCs and further outline the characteristics of the DCs classes. Findings: The proposed framework draws on the three DC classes of sensing, seizing and reconfiguring, and how they underscore logistics range and logistics response flexibility. The framework also distinguishes between DC classes and logistics flexibility that occur at operational, structural and strategic levels. DCs for the creation of logistics flexibility at a Swedish fast fashion retailer have also been identified and described as a means to further elaborate the characteristics of the DC classes. Research limitations/implications: Current empirical data is limited to one specific company context. Practical implications: The research presents a systematic and comprehensive map of different DCs that underscore logistics flexibility, a useful tool supporting logistics development efforts regarding flexibility. Originality/value: The establishment of a more detailed DC lens, in which different classes of DCs are included, means that an improved understanding for how flexibility is created can be achieved. It helps the research to move beyond the “here and now” existence of logistics flexibility to instead focus on how logistics flexibility can be created. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={There is increased interest in relocation to and from high-cost environments, but there remains a lack of knowledge with regard to operations capabilities in this specific context. The purpose of this study is thus to investigate critical operations capabilities in a high-cost environment. The research process is based on the investigation of an existing framework of operations capabilities through a multiple case study including five Swedish manufacturing companies. The findings reveal that all the dimensions and capabilities included in the framework were considered critical, and additional operations capabilities could be identified: service quality, supplier dependability, supplier flexibility, supply chain innovation, supply chain sustainability. The investigation underlines the dynamic nature of operations capabilities, which need to be updated constantly according to the environment in which they are developed. This study contributes on a practical level to managers by creating an overview of operations capabilities in a high-cost environment. Through the investigation of critical operations capabilities, it is possible for managers to find new areas of competitiveness, as well as to understand their current areas of excellence. The study makes several contributions, such as the identification of operations capabilities, their investigation and validation in a specific environment. © 2020 Operations and Supply Chain Management Forum.

abstract={At the same time as the Global Positioning System (GPS) has been applied to vehicle tracking and fleet management, other Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have also been proposed to improve supply chain efficiency. Among them, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and more recently wireless sensors, both currently dominate the research literature. However, many of these proposals lack realistic architecture, system integration in the supply chain, flexibility and cost-efficiency. In addition, several important research gaps need to be filled, such as driver identification, automatic management of journey schedule and security issues involved in wireless communications while collecting data. This paper copes with these issues by: proposing a telematic platform of an integral nature, enhancing tracking and tracing capabilities for vehicles and goods, giving a secure solution to the problem of installing wireless processing units in truck trailers and cabs, identifying drivers and journey itineraries, and assuring freight environmental parameters during the journey. Hardware and software prototypes have been successfully developed and tested in real vehicle case studies, including the transportation of agricultural products in the southeast of Spain. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach – In this study, six semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts from humanitarian organizations. The interviews were based on a simplified model of the transfer of medical equipment adapted from supply chain literature. The model ensured that all the process steps undertaken by humanitarian organizations were considered. Afterwards, the interviews were transcribed and structurally analysed to derive barriers and enablers. Finally, the results were described in light of three theoretical principles of systems thinking. Findings – In total, 14 types of barriers and 12 types of enablers were uncovered that illustrate the complexity of transferring medical equipment in humanitarian emergencies. The paper concludes with a proposal for future research to investigate if, and how, an approach guided by systems thinking could help to create a designated space for the formulation of original, synergetic solutions that address the identified barriers. Originality/value – This study is the first to explore the specific logistic challenges implicit in the transfer of medical equipment in humanitarian emergencies with a lifecycle perspective. Furthermore, the concept of systems thinking is rather novel in the field of transfer of medical technology. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Key factors of outsourcing strategies include cost and capacity flexibility. Cost saving and capacity flexibility depend on the connection between product characteristics and the supply chain network. Functional products involve efficient supply chains. Fashion products should move in the production and distribution system as quickly as possible in which maximum capacity flexibility provides a responsive supply chain. Moreover, complex products with global parts sourcing involve comparatively more risk. This paper evaluates an outsourcing strategies considering functional and fast fashion products in the textile supply chain. There are four categories of production options. Textile manufacturer receives production contracts at in-house facility in home country. Capacity flexibility is measured as the combination of destinations with maximum capacity. Product complexity risk is incorporated as the number of parts/components sourced domestically and internationally at each production destination. A multi-objective model for outsourcing strategiesis proposed based on operational cost, capacity flexibility, and product complexity risk. The model is solved using three variants of goal programming. Based on the results, several insights are proposed for outsourcing decision making.},

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the global social sustainability of the supply chains, pushing them towards a more flexible management approach. However, there is a paucity of literature that focuses on social sustainability issues for emerging economies. In the post-COVID-19 period, firms around the world will face several critical challenges to social sustainability, which will hinder achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Against this backdrop, this study identifies the pressing challenges to social sustainability in the post-COVID-19 context by a literature review and opinions from an expert panel, focusing on the footwear supply chain. In this paper, the best–worst method is applied to compute the criticality of social sustainability challenges towards the flexibility of the supply chains. The study findings reveal that among the nine identified critical challenges, “high level of lay off”, “health protocol development”, “complexity in ensuring workplace safety”, “facing trouble in mental health”, and “lack of government enforcement and regulations for social issues” are reported as the top five challenges, respectively. Furthermore, this study suggests several flexible managerial guidelines, which will help practitioners and policymakers to achieve SDGs considering the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.},

abstract={This paper presents our research on developing new lightweight and ultra-lightweight cement formulations which have resulted in higher cement strength, better adhesion and improved cement bond logs. The resulting formulation could be used for deeper placement in wells. Traditionally, these have been viewed as technology limiters for lightweight cements. We screened local raw materials, cement available in Saudi Arabia. This in combination with carefully selected glass microspheres, have resulted in unique ultra-lightweight cement formulation. Careful selection of particle sizing and micro-Additives has resulted in better adhesion. This paper describes the formulation, lab test results, and structural properties found through use of x-ray diffraction analytical testing. Additionally, it shows a comparison among the various density formulations with different microspheres and additives. Success in formulating with locally available ingredients improves supply chain flexibility - often a key in successful operations. Our results show nearly double the mechanical strength expected from a lightweight formulation lower than water density. Systematic approach considered during fluid optimization. The Paper will highlight the improved crush resistance of the beads and summarize the robust laboratory tests performed to qualify it for applications in a wide variety of challenging down-hole conditions including lost circulations and weak formations. Due to more predictable downhole density, complete circulation can be achieved deploying this slurry. The set cement mechanical properties, including compressive strength, have significantly improved which is essential for ensuring long-Term isolation. Conventional water-extended cement slurries are not considered adequate to isolate unconventional reservoirs such as shale and tight sandstone. We believe this formulation discovery, when further optimized, could be the basis of high-performance lightweight cement systems that are capable of deeper placement in the wells with improved pumpability and on-location rheology and set time control. Our formulations leverage normally available particulate materials to the best of our knowledge. © Copyright 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

abstract={Purpose – Direct digital manufacturing (DDM) is conceived of as either disrupting the entire manufacturing economy or merely enabling novel production. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an alternative where DDM coexists with and complements traditional mass production. When multiple parts run across one manufacturing line, DDM can isolate variability associated with low volume part production and may be preferred to mass production despite being expensive. If DDM complements rather than cannibalizes mass production, this alters the understanding of who adopts DDM, the products built with DDM, and DDM’s long-term supply chain implications. Design/methodology/approach – This invited paper explores a DDM rollout scenario and qualitatively assesses potential supply chain reconfigurations. Findings – The analysis recognizes that existing manufacturers with heterogeneous bills-of-material may develop DDM capabilities to isolate disruptive, low-volume production from scalable mass production. Developing DDM competence and raw material scale advantages, these manufacturers become the locus of change in a manufacturing landscape increasingly characterized by multi-product DDM supercenters. Originality/value – Extant research largely focusses on two potential reasons for DDM adoption: cost-per-unit and time-to-delivery comparisons. The authors explore a third driver: DDM’s capacity to isolate manufacturing variability attributable to low volume parts. Relative to the extant literature, this suggests a different DDM rollout, different adopters, and a different supply chain configuration. The authors identify mass manufacturing variability reduction as the mechanism through which DDM may be adopted. This adoption trajectory would eventually enable a supply chain transition in which spare parts inventory migrates from finished goods at proprietary facilities to raw materials at generalized DDM supercenters. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In order to manage the supply chain disruption, we introduce flexibility into the supply chain network of our inventory management problem. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process, and a state-dependent optimal threshold policy is derived. We show that the expected cost function is monotonic in the convex ordering of the demand distribution and that the optimal policy can be characterized with the ratio of the ordering cost and the disruption probability of supply. We also numerically demonstrate that the flexibility of the supply chain network reduces the total expected cost. © The Operations Research Society of Japan.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper provides a practical framework for managers to develop a sustainable supply chain. Given that rapid globalization has increased supply disruption risk, managers have been forced to establish efficient and responsive supply chain strategies. Nevertheless, diverse uncertainty factors, such as risk perception of strategies, have made practical management difficult. Quantifying managers' risk perceptions and applying them to supply chain strategies allows the authors to propose a structural and practical model for managing supply disruption. Design/methodology/approach: The existing structural model is refined by taking subjective factors into account using the analytic hierarchy process. The applicability of the refined model is demonstrated through a comparative case study. Findings: Managers' risk perceptions vary not only among companies but also between managing divisions within a company, which necessitates possible changes in strategy due to environmental turbulence. The principal component analysis (PCA) characterizes managers' risk perceptions that illustrate companies' emphases on disruption risk. Practical implications: The proposed approach quantifies risk perception, which enables practitioners to deal with subjective information in quantitative form. Comparative studies clarify differences in perception given different business backgrounds. The results provide managers with in-depth insights for establishing supply chain strategies reflecting their risk perception. Originality/value: Quantification of managers' subjective risk perception clarifies both the trend and the individual features for uncertainties. The results allow the authors to conduct the PCA, which characterizes companies. Comparative studies generalize the results of extant work, shedding light on cross-sectional differences given different business backgrounds. The effectiveness of the approach is confirmed through retrospective interviews with practitioners. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Supply networks are becoming increasingly complex with multiple overlapping relationships between firms that may span across industries. Consequently, inventory management is becoming more difficult as managers have to cope with variability in the supply flows that originate from different parts of the network. Managers that quickly sense abnormal flows may intervene and adapt their inventory policies in response to system changes. In this article, we present a framework for sensing abnormal flows originating within the upstream supply network of a focal organization. Our framework combines time series modeling with process charts to identify abnormal flow patterns in the incoming supply streams. It is a flexible framework that uses off-the-shelf technology to provide managers with a process that can be employed for monitoring multiple individual or aggregated data streams originating within any complex system such as complex adaptive supply networks. We illustrate our framework on four years of longitudinal supply data from the second largest food bank in the United States. We identify multiple instances of abnormal supply flows and validate our results through rigorous inventory analysis as well as field-based expert interviews. We discuss the implications of our findings for inventory management in complex supply networks, both from academic and practitioner points of view. © 2015 Decision Sciences Institute.},

abstract={Supply chain (SC) resilience and flexibility are important research topics receiving growing attention. However, the academic literature needs empirical studies on SC resilience capable of investigating the inter-organizational components of flexibility along different tiers. Therefore, this paper analyzes the main lack of flexibilities in three Brazilian automotive SCs that limit their resilience and therefore their capacity to better support and meet the demand changes in the marketplace. A multi-tier case study approach is adopted. Research findings identify lack of flexibilities in different tiers that inhibit the SC resilience as well as manufacturing and SC flexibilities that build SC resilience. The findings also highlight that the same SC may have the flexibility to be resilient for one of its products but not for another product, what sheds new lights on the academic literature. Finally, flexible SCs should be designed to increase SC resilience to cope with mishaps as significant demand changes.},

Furthermore, collaborative networked organizations need to be able to respond to rapidly changing demands and requirements, under uncertain conditions and without any centralized control. This emphasizes the need for adaptive, distributed, and self-coordinated supply networks decisions models. This study focuses on the efficient coordination of parallel, reconfigurable, inter-organizational supply operations. A novel market-based approach is introduced to support supply networks' parallel and decentralized reconfiguration.

abstract={Modern port infrastructures have become highly dependent on the operation of complex, dynamic ICT-based maritime supply chains. This makes them open and vulnerable to the rapidly changing ICT threat landscape and many ports are not yet fully prepared for that. Furthermore, these supply chains represent a highly interrelated cyber ecosystem, in which a plethora of distributed ICT systems of various business partners interact with each other. Due to these interrelations, isolated threats and vulnerabilities within a system of a single business partner may propagate and have cascading effects on multiple other systems, thus resulting in a large-scale impact on the whole supply chain. In this context, this article proposes a novel evidence-driven risk assessment methodology, i.e., the MITIGATE methodology, to analyze the risk level of the whole maritime supply chain. This methodology builds upon publicly available information, well-defined mathematical approaches and best practices to automatically identify and assess vulnerabilities and potential threats of the involved cyber assets. As a major benefit, the methodology provides a constantly updated risk evaluation not only of all cyber assets within each business partner in the supply chain but also of the cyber interconnections among those business partners. Additionally, the whole process is based on qualitative risk scales, which makes the assessment as well as the results more intuitive. The main goal of the MITIGATE methodology is to support the port authorities as well as the risk officers of all involved business partners. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The manufacturing industry faces an increasingly complex and dynamic environment due to shorter product life cycles, advanced production structures and expanding customer services. It is imperative that logistic key performance indicators (KPIs) be considered along with product costs and product quality to obtain a competitive advantage. Numerous companies possess an internal supply chain that fails to meet logistic performance goals set by the management. The measurables for logistic performance include logistic KPIs such as delivery time as well as cost relevant figures including work-in-process or the utilization of employees. In a case of unsatisfactory logistic KPIs, it is pertinent to identify the root causes before attempting to rectify the situation. Increasing digitalization within industry means a substantial volume of confirmation data is available regarding the core processes of a company's internal supply chain. This study discloses a model-based analysis of confirmation data to identify the root causes of unsatisfactory logistic KPIs. A framework for the analysis is constructed by defining generic cause-and-effect relationships between the relevant logistic KPIs and influencing as well as disturbing factors. The results produced by the model-based analysis and the interpretation of the confirmation data show the occurring cause-and-effect relationships for particular use cases and deduce the root causes for insufficient logistic KPIs. From there, companies can develop and implement suitable steps to increase the logistic KPIs by focusing on the newly-identified root causes instead of non-related, but recurring, complications. A case study is included to show the practicality of the presented method. The root cause analysis provides the basis for advanced logistics controlling systems to automatically identify weak-points and propose counteractive measures and therefore continuously improve and adapt the supply chain to changing conditions. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Supply chains often experience significant economic losses from disruptions such as facility breakdowns, transportation mishaps, natural calamities, and intentional attacks. To help respond and recover from a disruption, we investigate adjustments in order activity across four echelons including assembly. Simulation experiments reveal that the impact of a disruption depends on its location, with costlier and longer lasting impacts occurring from disruptions at echelons close to ultimate consumption. Cost functions based on system inventory and service can be quite ill-behaved in these complex problem settings. Expediting, an adaptive ordering approach often used to mitigate disruptions, can trigger unintended bullwhip effects, and hurt rather than help overall performance. As an alternative to expediting interventions, dynamic order-up-to policies show promise as an adaptive mitigation tool. We also find benefits in the dynamic policies from incorporating a metaheuristic parameter search over multiple echelons, yielding significantly better solution quality than embedded unimodal search. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Many new product introductions continue to be unsuccessful, and while researchers have studied product development processes, relatively few studies directly address new product launch. We do so in the present research and posit that supply chain intelligence, defined as technological and competitive knowledge sourced and integrated from suppliers, customers, and competitors, plays an important role in explaining new product launch success. We further employ the knowledge-based view to theorize that both supply chain adaptability and product innovation capability act as important mediators of the effects of supply chain intelligence on new product launch success and firm financial performance. While the former capability refers to a firm's ability to quickly adjust its supply chain to react to market and product design changes, the latter refers to the firm's proficiency in developing innovative new products. We test hypothesized relationships among these factors utilizing data collected in a survey of 229 U.S. manufacturing firms. Results point to the central role of supply chain adaptability in capturing the benefits of supplier technological intelligence for enhanced product innovation capability, new product launch success, and firm financial performance. In contrast, product innovation capability serves as the generative means by which customer and competitor intelligence is translated into more successful new product launches, which, in turn, produce superior firm financial performance. Overall, these findings contribute to a better understanding of factors that can explain why certain product launches are more successful than others, and offer practical insights for appropriate investments in the development of related knowledge resources. © 2015 Decision Sciences Institute.},

abstract={Multiclass queueing networks are an essential tool for modeling and analyzing complex supply chains. Roughly speaking, stability of these networks implies that the total number of customers/jobs in the network remains bounded over time. In this context robustness characterizes the ability of a multiclass queueing network to remain stable, if the expected values of the interarrival and service times distributions are subject to uncertain shifts. A powerful starting point for the stability analysis of multiclass queueing networks is the associated fluid network. Based on the fluid network analysis we present a measure to quantify the robustness, which is indicated by a single number. This number will be called the stability radius. It represents the magnitude of the smallest shift of the expected value of the interarrival and/or service times distributions so that the associated fluid network looses the property of stability. The stability radius is a worst case measure and is a conceptual adaptation from the dynamical systems literature. Moreover, we provide a characterization of the shifts that destabilize the network. Based on these results, we formulate a mathematical program that minimizes the required network capacity, while ensuring a desired level of robustness towards shifts of the expected values of the interarrival times distributions. This approach provides a new view on long-term robust production capacity allocation in supply chains. The capabilities of our method are demonstrated using a real world supply chain. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={REACH represents a global paradigm shift in chemical regulation, and it has introduced a new, complex regulatory process to which chemical producers and users throughout supply chains must adapt. This paper presents results of survey research to illustrate whether and how the business members of a large Scandinavian trade organization understand and comply with REACH. It also explores how these businesses obtain information about the chemicals they use in their products, and whether they feel that the information they have is sufficient to meet their needs. In addition, the paper describes how business size affects these issues. The survey results show that, at the time of this study, many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and a number of larger firms were unaware of REACH. Survey results consistently showed that the size of a company is an important factor in both understanding of and compliance with REACH, with respondents from large firms having a better grasp of REACH and its implications than smaller companies. An effective implementation of REACH will require, at the most basic level, more attention to educating EU companies, especially smaller ones, on how and why REACH applies to them. Survey respondents who were aware of REACH and its applicability to their firms also reported the types of support they needed in order to better understand and comply with the regulation, with nearly 40% of all respondents expressing a need for help with data systems or tools to manage REACH requirements and communicate REACH requirements to suppliers and customers. Many companies reported needing more information from their suppliers on chemical composition and related health impacts of materials and products. Ensuring that this information is readily available throughout supply chains is essential to reducing the negative impacts of chemicals and products on human health and the environment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={On-farm timber production is an important subsistence and economic activity of smallholder farmers around the world. Farmer investment in wood production and the degree of formality in the sector depends on access to and conditions of the market, the nature of the regulatory frameworks that govern rights to and movement of timber, and access to financing. We evaluate the process of formalization of a thriving and adaptive existing supply chain for small-dimension lumber originating in the fallows of smallholder farmers in the Peruvian Amazon. Through field research over three years based in semi-structured interviews with diverse actors in the Amazon, we found that the supply chain for fallow timber is driven entirely by informal and some illegal transactions. A key reason for this is the lack of an appropriate regulatory mechanism by which producers can gain authorization to harvest and sell this timber. We identify conditions necessary to formalize this sector, and evaluate the degree to which these are met under several scenarios. We recommend that the state develop mechanisms that recognize property rights of long-term residents and establish a simple fallow forestry registration mechanism; and that local governments or non-governmental organizations adopt adaptive and collaborative approaches to support farmers and provide training, information and networking among actors. State recognition of and support for fallow forestry, coupled with producers organizing for collective action on processing and marketing their timber, could result in the formalization of a significant volume of timber, improvements in income security for rural people, and the development of local entrepreneurial activities. © Copyright © 2021 Sears, Cronkleton, Miranda Ruiz and Pérez-Ojeda del Arco.},

abstract={Supply chain flexibility is increasingly important for gaining and maintaining a decisive competitive edge. Companies still remain in need of a powerful approach that allows an ongoing and feasible evaluation of supply chain flexibility to develop this ability in a targeted way. The key findings of our paper can be summarized to the extent that we introduce a new approach to methodically assess a supply chains flexibility based on appropriate key figures. Additionally, we further proof the functional capability of our newly developed evaluation approach. This evaluation is performed by investigating the process chain along the dyadic supplier-buyer relationships in terms of order lead time and cost deviations related to order-processing. Thus, a modified bivariate unilateral process capability analysis will be applied to calculate process capability measures of these supply chain processes. The capability measures indicate whether the supply chain processes investigated are capable of managing changing conditions in a timely and cost-efficient manner. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the majority of the currently valid types and dimensions of flexibility have been defined in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The current paper provides the leading academic journals and papers in the field of flexibility research. Additionally, the results of our citation analysis indicate that flexibility research is significantly influenced by papers that have been presented at subject-specific conferences. Finally, our paper presents a clearly arranged structure of the most frequently cited papers dealing with manufacturing and supply chain flexibility. Furthermore, its contents and findings are briefly discussed to provide an overview of the previous academic research. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Accurate order promising is a key requirement for customer satisfaction. Nevertheless, practitioners struggle with the reliability of the delivery dates they promise to customers. Consequently, the costs of demand fulfilment soar due to intensified communication, emergency processes in logistics and acquisition of costly external production resources. We identify and formalise product and process flexibilities in supply chains that can be exploited in production planning. Product flexibility is the possibility to produce several kinds of products from one predecessor product. Process flexibility is the possibility to use one production process to manufacture several products. In order to increase the accuracy and robustness of delivery dates, we develop an order promising methodology able to deal with demand mix uncertainty and heterogeneous customer order lead times. The approach anticipates changes in production plans made possible by product and process flexibilities. In a numerical study based on a case from the semiconductor industry, we demonstrate that our method increases the accuracy and robustness of order promises. For the studied case, we find that the consideration of process flexibility is more important for the generation of accurate and robust order promises than the consideration of product flexibility. © 2016 Infineon Technologies AG.},

abstract={Globalization has resulted in globally dispersed suppliers (Blackhurst et al. 2005). These disperse suppliers are exposed to multiple unforeseen natural and manmade risks and vulnerabilities (Simchi-Levi et al. 2014; Zsidisin et al. 2004). One of the consequences of exposure to manmade and natural risks is supply chain disruption (Schmidt and Raman 2012; Zsidisin et al. 2004). Therefore, the risks and vulnerabilities faced by the supply chain of large enterprises have made them to focus on monitoring supply chain risks and preparing their organizations to be resilient enough to come back after a significant disruption. Supply chain risk is defined as “any risks for the information, material and product flows from the original supplier to the delivery of the final product for the end user” (Jüttner et al. 2003), and resilience is defined as “the capacity for an enterprise to survive, adapt, and grow in the face of turbulent change” (Fiksel 2006). Based on the systems theory, two types of resilience are identified. They are inherent resilience and adaptive resilience (Buikstra et al. 2010). But the third type of resilience, anticipated resilience, is also recognized as essential, which is the company’s ability to continually innovate and be prepared for any adverse effects (Hamel and Valikangas 2003). All three resiliencies are necessary for the continuity of business after a disaster. Apart from this, companies have also realized the importance of transparency or visibility of inherent vulnerabilities of the firm to which a supply chain is exposed to (Kleindorfer and Saad 2005). This work-in-progress paper is based on the data collected from a major supplier in the United States. It focuses on addressing the question, “how does anticipated, inherent and adaptive resilience, as well as supply chain visibility, influence business continuity programs?” The contingent resource-based theory (Brandon-Jones et al. 2014) is employed to establish and explain the relationship among inherent resilience, anticipated resilience, adaptive resilience, supply chain visibility in performance, and business continuity. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.},

We intend to empirically examine the impact of supply chain flexibility on supply chain performance (SCP) and also to identify the antecedent variables to SCF. This study includes 249 samples from manufacturing industry. We used structural equation model with a partial least square (PLS-SEM) approach for examining the model and SmartPLS 2.0 software was used for analysis. The result indicates that the SCF significantly contributes to the supply chain performance namely demand management, supply chain reliability (SCR) and supply chain knowledge development. The mediation analysis shows that SCF partially mediates the relationships between supply chain capabilities and supply chain performance. The findings contribute to the existing literature and also provide direction for further research in SCF. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The goal is to minimize the sum of holding and delivery costs. This problem is proved to be strongly NP-hard. Consider two special cases, in which the jobs have identical processing times. For the problem with limited outsourcing budgets, a NP-hardness proof, a pseudo-polynomial algorithm and a fully polynomial time approximation scheme are presented. For the problem with unlimited outsourcing budgets, the problem is shown to be equivalent to the shortest path problem, and therefore it is in class P. This shortest-path-problem solution approach is further shown to be applicable to a similar but more applicable problem, in which the number of deliveries is upper bounded. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Research suggests that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in India are hesitant to adopt the leading management practices. This exacerbates their competitive disadvantage against larger firms in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving marketplace. Indian SMEs’ reluctance to embrace advanced management practices may be explained by their satisficing business behaviors. In other words, Indian SMEs are highly likely to continue with business as usual - a customary of deficient modus of operandi, and refuse to search for optimal solutions and practices. We argue that overcoming satisficing biases may require Indian SMEs to strive for strategic flexibility that allow for prompt adjustments in value creation activities. A higher strategic flexibility allows SMEs in the manufacturing sector to rapidly adjust product range, variety, innovativeness, and speed of development to capitalize on new opportunities and minimize the negative impact of changing market conditions. This may allow SMEs to overcome competitive disadvantages and compete effectively against larger firms in the market. We argue that SMEs seeking to obtain strategic flexibility must focus on information quality and supply chain integration. We assess the proposed model using a sample of 100 top SME managers operating in India. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how packaging postponement can be effectively leveraged in a dynamically changing diverse retail market where responsiveness is key. The study also guides about the empirical evaluation of how packaging postponement affects the performance in the sanitary pads supply chain by considering operating measures. The focal company belongs to the Indian Fast Moving Consumer Goods sector, hygiene products category. It examines the measures that are critical to a responsive supply chain and presents a comparative analysis of selected measures before and after implementation. The findings illustrate that the packaging postponement not only improves competitive advantage but also significantly contributes to improving product proliferation and supply chain responsiveness. The study provides understanding of drivers and obstacles for packaging postponement strategy with operational insights about how-to implement. Most of modelling-based research studies justify the adoption of postponement through savings in inventory only and underplay on other operating measures. While justifying, studies emphasise form/manufacturing aspects and underestimate the packaging aspects of postponement. This paper addresses these gap areas by systematically highlighting prerequisites and demonstrates the benefits of adopting a packaging strategy to handle variety and responsiveness in an emerging economy. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.},

Case overview/synopsis: This case visualizes the planning of supply chain drivers and process improvement to enhance supply chain speed and flexibility. Asim Rizvi has recently joined as senior supply chain manager at Food Lord, a renowned chain of restaurants in Pakistan. As instructed by his CEO, Rizvi has to take a decision for centralization, or to continue the decentralization of supply chain operations at two of their highest selling branches. These two branches were located at a distance of 125 km from each other. The objective of supply chain operations’ consolidation was to minimize cost and further improve the service level. Rizvi was confused about the decision because any decision cannot be taken on the basis of cost and benefit analysis only. A 360-degree analysis and future requirements also play a vital role to decide about supply chain operations. The CEO was very excited to take this decision; that is why newly hired manager Rizvi was analyzing all the facts to reach a decision that would be best for their business. Centralized or decentralized supply chain decision was not easy because normally the business dynamics completely change due to unpredictable customer demand, unavailability of professional suppliers and unavailability of a strong information system, etc. Complexity academic level: BBA and MBA Supplementary materials: Teaching notes are available for educators only.

abstract={The recent trade friction between the two largest economies, US and China, is having a profound impact on the sustainable development of supply chains at a global scale. Supply chain collaborative innovation has not only become the main means for enterprises in various countries to cope with imponderable changes, but also been the driver of increasing supply chain dynamic capability and of achieving sustainable development of supply chains. Based on the survey data of 510 Chinese enterprises, this paper adopts the hierarchical regression analysis and a structural equation model to study the impact of supply chain collaborative innovation on the sustainable development of supply chains. The results show that: (1) Three modes of supply chain collaborative innovation (namely, technology collaborative innovation, management collaborative innovation, and market collaborative innovation) have different effects on supply chain dynamic capability and sustainable supply chain performance. (2) Supply chain dynamic capability plays a significant intermediary role between supply chain collaborative innovation and sustainable supply chain performance. (3) Supply chain technology collaborative innovation has the greatest direct impact on sustainable supply chain performance, followed by supply chain management collaborative innovation. However, the direct effect of supply chain market collaborative innovation on sustainable supply chain performance is not significant; under the intermediary role of dynamic capability, supply chain market collaborative innovation has a significant indirect effect on sustainable supply chain performance. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={During the research with respect to the traditional supply chain, Enterprise autonomy is ignored. Within this thesis, from the perspective of CAS, the dynamic growth of supply chain was inspected by using CAS versus evolutionary game theory. Within supply chain, the corporate was viewed as agent. In the same way, the variety branches of the corporate were viewed as sub-agents. The agent-based model of supply chain was set up in this thesis. At the same time, supply chain dynamic evolution was simulated through swarm. The effective solution to coordinate the supply chain main body behaviour was explored too. Within this thesis, the evolutionary trait of supply chain is explored, and a reference for supply chain governance is provided. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The procurement of food grains from farmers is one of the biggest challenges under the COVID-19 outbreak due to country-wise lockdowns. The present study aims to reconfigure the existing food grain supply chain network. The study advances the extant literature by proposing a novel mathematical model that considers the government guidelines issued to procure food grains from farmers under the COVID-19 situation. The model includes personal distancing, a key parameter relevant in the COVID-19 crisis, and has remained unaddressed in the existing literature. The proposed model is tested in India. The effect of different parameters like personal distancing cost, carbon emission cost, fixed cost, and transportation cost is also investigated under a given set of procurement centers. Finally, the procurement schedule for each procurement center is generated, which is especially useful for managing its activities and is also helpful to farmers to streamline the process. Results indicate that the proposed model is highly effective under pandemic emergencies like the current COVID-19 crisis. Policymakers and the government will find this model helpful in drafting relevant policies regarding food grain procurement under emergencies such as the COVID-19 outbreak. The distribution segment of the supply chain network is not part of the present research work. In future studies, this part could be then added to the whole of the procurement process, and both procurement and distribution can be assessed together again. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={India is the second most populous country in the world. With its ever-increasing population and the land size shrinking, food security poses one of the biggest threats. The economic growth has been tremendous over the past few years but, the country still struggles with widespread poverty and hunger. India ranks 129th on the Global Hunger Index (2015), released by IFPRI. Despite being a major agriculture player, India is home to 25% of the world's hungry population. The four parameters for analyzing Food Security are-Availability, Accessibility, Stability and Utility. Currently, the farmers are unawares about the demand and therefore, do not know how much to produce. If these questions are answered, millions could be unshackled from the deadly chains of hunger and malnutrition. The aim of this paper is to review how usage of big data in warehousing will enhance the accessibility of food. If the farmers are given a first-hand, timely and reliable information through information communication technology tools (ICT), a major chunk of the problem can be solved. Data on demand will enable efficient warehousing, a resilient and adaptable supply chain, and overall, help in paving the way for a better market integration. Big data analysis will provide the information in a usable form on how much to produce, store and distribute. Use of big data in warehousing will come to play and help in improving the accessibility of food aided by a zero-defect resilient supply chain. This paper will analyze the lacunas in data accessibility which render the efficacy of adequate supply of food. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how blockchain technology can improve supply chain adaptability, alignment and agility which collectively enhance competitive advantage which in turn influences firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual framework of the present study is developed by conducting an extensive literature review on blockchain technology, supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility and competitive advantage. The sample data were collected from 397 supply chain practitioners in India to validate the conceptual model. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to ascertain the validity of the measures used and a structural model was analyzed for testing the proposed conceptual framework. Findings: The results of the present study show that blockchain technology can improve supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility which lead to competitive advantage, which leads to better firm performance. Besides, trust generated through blockchain use also increases firm performance. Research limitations/implications: Currently, the respondents do not have practical experience of using blockchain technology. They have responded based on their knowledge about supply chain and blockchain which they acquired from published sources. Different supply chains require different strategic choices and different information needs. But the present study assumes that all supply chain needs are identical. The present study assumes that government regulations regarding blockchain technology are favorable; however, currently, there is no legal framework to address blockchain technology. The findings of the current study indicate that companies not only should create more awareness regarding blockchain but also should actively work with IT companies that are engaged in developing blockchain-based supply chain solution. Managers, as well as IT companies and academicians, should join hands to study and develop a framework for regulating blockchain technology and suggest these to the policy actors. Practical implications: The present study shows that supply chain practitioners are confident that blockchain technology will help improve supply chain parameters. These findings can help IT companies and their marketers for developing and promoting blockchain-based IT applications. In addition, the important implication for supply chain practitioners is that blockchain helps in creating a competitive advantage and increases firm performance. Originality/value: The effect of IT on important supply chain variables has been studied in the past; however, there is not a single study which sheds light on how disruptive technologies such as blockchain will affect supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility and firm performance. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of supply chain flexibility on customer satisfaction. The entire population consisted of managers of drugstores who are directly having a contact with pharmaceutical industry companies in Jordan was deemed as a sample of the current study. A total of 200 questionnaires were handed to the subjects, out of them 144 questionnaires were used as primary data for the purpose of the present study. Both IMB SPSS 19.0 and AMOS 23.0 were run to examine hypotheses. The results of the study supported the hypotheses that new product, distribution, delivery, and responsiveness flexibility have significant influences on customer satisfaction. In light of these findings, it was concluded that customers or managers of drugstores are strongly concerned with supply chain flexibility, even a large part of their satisfaction relates to this aspect. The originality of this study is that it was conducted on Jordanian drugstores, especially since studies on these settings are still very few. The study recommends that a hard work should be done to improve the supply chain flexibility of pharmaceutical companies due to its significant impact on customer satisfaction.

abstract={To achieve more efficient recycling management of construction and demolition waste (C&D waste) and to encourage investment in recycling enterprise technology in underdeveloped areas, this study develops a dynamic Nash supply chain model, with and without government subsidy, for a C&D waste recycling treatment system comprised of two recycling enterprises and one builder. We investigate the mechanism of government subsidy regulation on recycling enterprises' technology decisions, the optimal proportion of technology upgrades of recycling enterprises, and the effects of other exogenous factors on the decision of government and recycling enterprises in an early stage of the recycling industry. The results show that with the subsidy, the recycling enterprises' proportion of technology upgrade and profits is always improved. And recycling enterprise will actively increase investment to increase the proportion of technology upgrades. Furthermore, the government should prioritize assisting enterprises that are among the first to invest in recycling technology. Interestingly, the proportion of subsidy and technology upgrades is also affected by the unit environmental benefit and the degree of substitution of renewable products with different technological levels. When the degree of substitution is low, not only government subsidies are required to play a role but also builders' awareness of the benefits of using high-tech renewable products, in order to drive enterprise technology investment from the demand side. The study provides detailed information on government and recycling enterprise C&D waste recycling strategies. © 2022 Ziwei Shen et al.},

abstract={In 2017, global CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels reached 33 gigatons, twice the natural rate at which CO2 is absorbed back into land and ocean sinks. Harnessing solar radiation holds the answer to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. It is the most abundant energy resource and could meet humans’ future energy needs. The efficient conversion of solar radiation into stable, energy-dense liquid energy carriers that can use existing or adapt global supply chains for storage, shipping, and distribution is the key to large-scale deployment of solar energy at gigaton levels. Liquid sunshine is the vision of combining the sun's energy with carbon dioxide and water to produce green liquid fuels. CO2 released on using these fuels is recycled back into the environment, thus maintaining an ecologically balanced cycle. Multi-source and multi-purpose alcohols are optimal candidate fuels. Methanol and ethanol are actionable first targets with gigaton production potential. The intertwined goals of economic growth, environmental conservation, and energy security (3E) are pressing global challenges of our time. The paper discusses solutions to 3E goals, particularly in the context of developing countries that are most affected by climate change and local environmental degradation. 3E goals call for “common man solutions”; cheap, clean energy that can help combat hazardous pollution threatening public health and break the mutually reinforcing downward spiral of human poverty and environmental degradation. Alcohols are clean, affordable, multi-source, multi-purpose fuels that can rise to the call. The liquid sunshine roadmap charts stepwise technology advancements from intermediate technologies such as natural gas renewable hybrid systems to green systems for methanol production entirely from renewable energy. Intermediate solutions such as hybrid alcohols build production capacity, establish downstream markets, and begin the adaptation of existing supply chain infrastructure for subsequent widespread market penetration of alcohols in the global energy market. Hybrid alcohols also provide the “breathing space” until green technologies reach maturity for commercial production of green alcohols. Looking ahead, green alcohols and electricity can function as the dual pillars of green energy systems, with alcohol reservoirs forming the backbone. Such green energy systems can support myriad applications and services to build a sustainable future. Replacing fossil fuels with renewables will require efficient carriers of the sun's energy at gigaton scale. The diagram illustrates an ecologically balanced cycle where green alcohols are produced by combining sunshine with CO2 and H2O drawn from the environment and returned to the environment. Only the sun's energy is consumed in the cycle. Methanol, an example of a green alcohol, is a multi-purpose liquid energy carrier of the Sun's energy. It can also function as “liquid hydrogen” and “liquid electricity.” © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Flexible supply chain networks are one of the most effective class of supply chains in both manufacturing and service sectors. In such networks, different delivery modes can significantly influence the efficiency of the entire supply chain. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for a multi-product four-stage flexible supply chain network design (SCND) problem in a solid transportation environment. The presented model considers three different delivery modes namely normal delivery, direct shipment and direct delivery. Since the problem is NP-hard, meta-heuristic approaches should be used to solve it. For this aim, ten classical and adaptive meta-heuristic algorithms are developed. In order to calibrate the parameters of the proposed algorithms, a typical experimental study is done. After the parameter setting stage, the final experiments on some randomly generated test problems are performed. The Obtained results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive vibration damping optimization (AVDO) algorithm performs better than the other algorithms. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background. Educational games are widely used in business classes in general, and supply chain management (SCM) classes in particular. These games are designed to familiarize students with the real business world. Most SCM games are ready-made, with pre-set learning objectives focusing on a certain module in a supply chain. Intervention. This article presents the new spreadsheet-based Flexible Supply Chain Management Game (FSCMG) and the findings of its pilot study. FSCMG’s features are transparent to instructors and students alike. It is easily modifiable to suit an instructor’s learning objectives. Method. Six groups of undergraduate students took turns playing three modules, namely a wholesaler, manufacturer, and supplier. There were two groups per module to represent two supply chains. The students’ spreadsheets are analyzed and presented. Results. Students’ spreadsheets revealed that they were able to employ SCM conceptual understanding in FSCMG, particularly pricing strategy, inventory management, forecasting, and the relationships within a supply chain. Conclusion. FSCGM helped the students apply their in-class knowledge in a real-world situation and be well prepared for their future careers where an extensive understanding is required. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={A significant aspect of advanced industrial cyber-production (ICP) in the proposed understanding of the Industry 4.0 concept is complementarity. Complementary ICP is a business-system (BS) of mutually beneficial commercial companies interacting with each other. Companies resort to ensuring the complementary of ICP to improve their business processes with the resources of the BS. The problematic issues and methods of organizing a stably functioning complementary ICP are considered. A promising way to improve complementary ICP is the introduction of adaptive management mechanisms for the supply chains of components in the overall BS. Adaptive supply chain management tools optimize inventory and supply logistics. A scheme of interaction between business entities forming complementary ICP is proposed. Adaptive management and complementary ICP bring to life the ideal business approaches of a virtual factory. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Considering the need for more effective decision support in the context of distributed manufacturing, this paper develops an advanced analytics framework for configuring supply chain (SC) networks. The proposed framework utilises a distributed multi-agent system architecture to deploy fuzzy rough sets-based algorithms for knowledge elicitation and representation. A set of historical sales data, including network node-related information, is used together with the relevant details of product families to predict SC configurations capable of fulfilling desired customer orders. Multiple agents such as data retrieval agent, knowledge acquisition agent, knowledge representation agent, configuration predictor agent, evaluator agent and dispatching agent are used to help execute a broad spectrum of SC configuration decisions. The proposed framework considers multiple product variants and sourcing options at each network node, as well as multiple performance objectives. It also captures decisions that span the entire SC simultaneously and, by implication, represents multiple network links. Using an industry test case, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of fulfilling customer orders with lower production and emissions costs, compared to the results generated using existing tools. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In order to improve coordination in the supply chain, the selection of a supply chain coordination mechanism plays an important role. Due to the multi-dimensional nature of a supply chain problem, the selection of the right supply chain coordination mechanisms (SCCMs) in a given situation remains a difficult and most challenging task for supply chain managers. In this paper, an attempt has been made first to explore various issues pertaining to the selection and implementation of SCCMs and finally to create an analytical network process (ANP) based framework to help supply chain managers to take appropriate steps in the selection of SCCMs in a given situation. The framework presented in this paper summarises the role of market responsiveness, process integration, risk, requirement and flexibility for supply chain performance. The paper explores the relationship among cost, flexibility, quality, service level and lead time to prioritise coordination mechanisms of supply chain for Indian manufacturing companies. The paper concludes with the justification of the framework, which analyses and prioritises the alternatives using ANP to improve coordination in supply chain.

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a sudden change from normal conditions to disruption conditions, and industrial sectors have experienced eroded growth. In particular, the manufacturing industry experienced a slowdown due to the sudden disruption in supply and de-mand. This situation stimulates the manufacturing industry to recover from this current challenging disruption. This study investigates the impact of supply chain integration on business performance through supply chain resilience, supply chain flexibility, and innovation system in Indonesia’s manufacturing companies. Data collection has obtained as many as 470 questionnaires considered valid for further analysis. Data analysis used the partial least square (PLS) technique using smartPLS software version 3.0. The results show that supply chain integration affects innovation system, supply chain flexibility, and supply chain resilience because of its ability to share complete product information and share production planning. Innovation systems and supply chain flexibility enhance supply chain resilience through the ability to deal with sudden changes in customer demand and production problems. Supply chain integration improves business performance through innovation, supply chain flexibility, and supply chain resilience in the COVID-19 era. This research could be the best practice for managers in restoring manufacturing performance quickly. This study also contributes to the current research in supply chain management. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Tessilform company is an organization permeated by creative thinking that could be defined as a thinking organization. Its dynamic hybrid business model is a flexible lean and agile integrated system. Fast and flexible capabilities infuse its entire supply chain, with a joint focus on continuous supply chain process innovation, to deliver high-quality products and customer service levels. The supply chain collaboration in trying and experimenting new solutions enables the fast adoption of new technologies together with its supply chain partners. This approach to process innovation, called collaborative experimentation, drives to a more flexible supply chain that easily reacts to change and is able to quickly respond to new trends and market challenges. Patrizia Pepe’s case study explains “unconventional” innovation as composed by three dimensions: being a thinking organization; evolving an integrated system as business model; and continuously innovating processes, including collaborative experimentation with supply chain partners. In this chapter, we review this case story and vision, supported by the leaders’ words to discover the real roots of their particular “unconventional” innovation approach that drives their success. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Emerging research within the field of personalised medicines has aimed to enhance patient treatment through the use of pharmaceutical products that are customised to the individual needs and preferences of the patient. The currently dominant production platforms of pharmaceutical products, however, regard a mass production paradigm and are thus unfeasible for the production and provision of personalised medicines. The production platforms are not designed or are intended for a customisation context. Operating such a context with the current supply chain entails challenges such as increasing costs, time to patient and efforts in quality assurance activities. To address these challenges, this paper presents four reconfigured pharmaceutical supply chain designs. A qualitative operational performance assessment elicits the strengths and weaknesses of the respective supply chain design operating in a customisation context. The results suggest that a later point of variegation, that is, the point in the supply chain where the final customisation is achieved, can relieve the operational effort of the stakeholders in the supply chain while providing the benefits of personalised medicines, that is, an enhanced treatment outcome of the patient. A trade-off remains, however, between the supply chain’s decreased operational effort and degree of necessary reconfigurations, such as introducing new functions to stakeholder operation, reallocating activities to other stakeholders or educating stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={In material requirements planning (MRP) systems, safety stock and safety time are two well-known inventory buffering strategies to protect against supply and demand uncertainties. While the role of safety stocks in coping with uncertainty is well studied, safety time has received only scarce attention in the supply chain management literature. Particularly, most previous operations research models have typically considered the use of such inventory buffers in a separate fashion, but not together. Here, we propose a decision support system (DSS) to address the problem of integrating optimal safety stock and safety time decisions at the component level, in multi-supplier multi-item single-stage industrial supply chains under dynamic demands and stochastic lead times. The DSS is based on a hybrid bi-objective optimization approach that simultaneously optimizes upstream inventory holding costs and β-service levels, suggesting multiple non-dominated Pareto-optimal solutions to decision-makers. We further explore a weighted closed-form analytical expression to select a single Pareto-optimal point from a set of non-dominated solutions, thereby enhancing the practical application of the proposed DSS. We describe the implementation of our approach in a major automotive electronics company operating under a myriad of components with dynamic demand, uncertain supply and requirements plans with different degrees of sparsity. We show the potential of our approach to improve β-service levels while minimizing inventory-related costs. The results suggest that, in certain cases, it appears to be more cost-effective to combine safety stock with safety time compared to considering each inventory buffer independently. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Abstract In the last decade, sustainable supply chain management has become a key topic in the sustainability literature as well as a buzzword in industry and policy circles. Although research has made substantial contributions, there is a lack of understanding on how focal companies operating in emerging economies can lead the implementation of sustainability into their supply chains. This research connects and advances the constructs of cleaner production, sustainability and supply chains by exploring a classic case of a focal company operating in an emerging economy that, even facing considerable challenges, has been able to succeed in transforming its entire supply chain. Drawing from stakeholder theory and contingency theory, this research offers four key contributions to the sustainability and supply chain discourses as follows: 1) it proposes an innovation-centered approach to sustainable supply chain management, by adapting and extending the TCOS uncertainty framework; 2) it suggests that the way a focal company manages and is influenced by its established network of relationships shape the evolution of the supply chain sustainability trajectories; 3) it argues that supply chains are dynamic entities and should then be considered and understood through the lenses of evolutionary approaches; and 4) it suggests that the implementation and management of sustainable supply chains are context-specific challenges and therefore theoretical, managerial and policy generalizations are difficult to be achieved. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This paper provides a brief introduction and proposal to a new concept that addresses expected future issues in the dynamic digital supply chain organization. Industry 4.0 is a vanguard for massive automation of production. However, researches are focused on questions of internal coordination, collaboration, and optimization. At the same time, the future outlook indicates that additional significant added value is in the application of these externally between partners within a supply chain. The introduced concept is based on the currently finishing research with a goal to introduce a new universal Industry 4.0 maturity model from small- and middle-sized manufacturing companies. This research reused best practices from significant existing Industry 4.0 maturity models but solved identified gaps simultaneously. In addition, additional studies and research were conducted to fill these gaps. On the other hand, the side effect of these steps was a shift in the final focus of the new Industry 4.0 maturity model from a technical to a business perspective. As a result, this new Industry 4.0 maturity model understands Industry 4.0 as a transformation towards a digital learning organization. Regarding this shift and observations on the side of real manufacturing companies, there is a prediction of future issues related to enabling cooperation within a supply chain between partners that is one of the main components of the learning organization paradigm. The introduced concept addresses these future issues with integration and automation between independent organizations and provides possible solutions. This paper also mentions a prototype under development that evaluates the feasibility of this concept. Current tests are performed in laboratory conditions, but there are also described plans for tests under conditions in semi-real situations and planned next stages of the development with the utilization of AI and ML. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={In times of economic crises and increasing market competition, business stability, quality, safety and supply chain flexibility and cost optimization play an increasing role in companies that strive to stay and survive in the market. A wise choice of suppliers, in such circumstances, becomes increasingly important prerequisite for the success of any company. This paper presents a novel model for supplier assessment. The proposed model considers the performance of suppliers classified into several different groups of questions related to all the relevant issues: finance, logistics, competitiveness, quality and level of supplier services. This model can be applied in a variety of companies and for different supplier categories based on their purchase categories and therefore achieve a realistic assessment. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The design of a supply chain (SC) aims to minimize cost so the product can reach the customer at the cheapest cost with flexible demand. The demand of a product is variable with time and environment. Most of the researchers have considered investment cost, processing cost, and transportation cost as variable costs to minimize the cost while considering a constant demand. In actual practice, the demands are flexible. In this paper, a two-stage stochastic programming model has been proposed for a capacities-based network design of a supply chain for flexible demands while considering inventory carrying cost and missed opportunity cost in addition to the above-mentioned costs. It will enhance the logistic planning and seek the location network optimally. Furthermore, in the first stage, decision variables represent different nodes (facility locations of echelons) of the supply chain, with the assumption that they will be considered at the design stage before uncertain parameters are unveiled. On the other hand, decision variables related to the amount of products to be produced and stored in the nodes of the SC, the flows of materials among the entities of the network, and shortfalls and excess at the customer centers are considered as second-stage variables. The methodology has been illustrated by solving an example. It was found that the proposed model yields more feasible and advantageous results. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={To enhance the commercial competitive advantage of a firm in a constantly changing business environment, it is very important to enhance the supply chain performance by making it more flexible to adopt any type of changes in dynamic business environment. To improve the supply chain performance and make it more flexible it is essential to control the order amplification or bullwhip effect (BWE) through various stages of supply chain and control the inventory costs by controlling net stock amplification (NSA). These tasks should be done by using accurate demand forecasting. The current study demonstrates a forecasting methodology about nonlinear customer demand in a multilevel supply chain (SC) structure through; integrated techniques of discrete wavelet theory and artificial intelligence techniques including artificial neural networks and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system. The effectiveness of forecasting models to deal with nonlinear data and how they improved the flexibility of SC is demonstrated by calculating BWE and NSA for real world data. © 2015, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.},

abstract={People from all walks of life sharing all types of thoughts exchange one collective challenge, which is ‘starvation’, and it needs ‘food’ for existence. Fertilizers shall carry on playing an important part in meeting this ‘everlasting challenge.’ Needless to say that green supply chain management has countless significance in the ‘fertilizer sector’. There are incredible monetary and ecological opportunities for development in the supply chains of fertilizer plants. Manufacturing of fertilizers caused some pollution, which manifests all through its supply chain in the form of losses. The additional need of fertilizers in agricultural sector must primarily ensure food safety and environmental protection. Through this research paper, an effort has been made to express a model of twelve governing drivers which play an important role in the execution of green supply chain management for the fertilizer plant in Punjab, India. The methodology used in the analysis of drivers was ‘Interpretive Structural Modeling,’ and ‘Matriced Impacts Croises Multiplication Applique and Classment analysis’ was applied for improved understanding of all these drivers. The analysis proved that Government Regulatory System was a key driver for the implementation of green supply chain management practices. It would further help the management to focus on the main drivers in the execution of such environment friendly practices. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).},

Design/methodology/approach: The author(s) have gone through extensive literature review and extracted 22 SCF dimensions. After conducting field visits and expert interaction in the firm related to case industry, 11 major SCF dimensions that seem to have a significant amount of influence on supply chain performance of the firms were retained for further consideration. The author(s) have used decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) to establish initial causality and structural equation model (SEM) to investigate the contribution of different flexibility dimensions on overall SCF. Findings: After DEMATEL analysis, three major SCF dimensions were considered for SEM modeling. The result shows that product flexibility and physical distribution flexibility have favorable influence on the SCF, while the demand management flexibility adversely impacts overall SCF. Practical implications: The approach adopted in the study can help firms to determine and exercise the flexibility dimensions of a particular supply chain. The DEMATEL and SEM offer a facilitation to explain the causal relationship between the different dimensions to take long-term decisions and address the uncertainty in the demand and supply side.

abstract={With the changing business environment, firms are adopting flexible systems across their supply chains as a survival as well as a growth strategy. The aim of the article is to identity the key enablers of supply chain flexibility (SCF) adoption and to evaluate their fitness in the context of the personal hygiene industry in India. After a systematic literature review, 22 key dimensions of SCF have been extracted. A field investigation through interviews and a brainstorming session with industry experts have resulted in 11 dimensions, finally. Twenty-six experts participated in this interview and brainstorming session. These 11 dimensions have been exposed to interpretive structural modelling (ISM) to assess the hierarchal interaction among them. Fuzzy MICMAC has been employed to identify the driving dimensions of supply chain flexibility for the personal hygiene industry. The findings suggest that seven dimensions, namely process, manufacturing, sourcing, volume, market, new product development and coordination, have high dependence but weak driving power and are thus dependent on the other dimensions to influence the supply chain flexibility. Demand management and product flexibilities were found to have the strongest driving force and act as the key drivers for SCF. The originality of the conducted study lies in the multilevel hierarchical structure. © 2020 International Management Institute, New Delhi.},

abstract={Although personal care sector within fast-moving consumer goods industry has been known as a key contributor toward the growth of the economy, barely any study has been conducted to assess the flexibilities in the personal care supply chain. Further, being competitive and challenging environment of the industry, domestic personal care firms are stressed for their supply chain performance. The state of affairs is predominantly critical in the soap manufacturing firms, which have simple, but yet long, supply chain with ample amount of uncertainty due to intense competition, and therefore increase the challenges for firms such as “how much to produce” and “how much should be the production lead time.” Using expert views along with academicians and literature support, this paper investigates the flexibilities associated with soap manufacturing supply chain. The paper utilizes a distinctive approach of assessing the supply chain flexibility through system dynamics (SD) model and endorses the model in a soap manufacturing setting in India. The setting has been examined by changing the level of order rate and production lead time. The model along with the overall supply chain performance of a soap producing unit evaluated indicates the degree of flexibility achievable by the firm. Flexibility dimensions having considerable and outranked influence on enlightening the supply chain performance are recognized. The findings of study indicate demand pattern of packed and unpacked soaps shows seasonal fluctuations; interesting thing is that when one category soap demand increases, the other category’s demand shows slowdown. If case firm takes measures to improve the backlog or production gap through varying lead times, the performance of flexible supply chain can be enhanced. Finding also suggests that improved results may be obtained by varying the order rate. Simulation results show improvement in inventory of packed and unpacked soaps, shipment gap and hiring rate of the firm. The study is exclusive in reviewing the common man’s sector of personal care industry, which has received the least consideration in the literature and practice. The study claims to be unique by applying SD modeling to respond to research questions raised up along with inferences for practice and theory. © 2019, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.},

abstract={Purpose: In the present scenario of global competition and economic recession, most of the organizations are facing tough challenge to survive in the market because of shortening product life cycle and reducing profit margin. Customers are seeking better design, production and delivery, which have made firms to concentrate on flexibility in supply chains. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify major factors and develop a suitable framework for flexibility in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: Based on literature review, about 14 factors have been identified. To develop relationship among these factors, a team of five experts from industry and academia was formed. Based on inputs from experts, different relationships are developed among factors to form structural self-interaction matrix (SSIM). Based on this matrix, a flexibility framework is developed by interpretive structural modelling approach. Findings: Top management commitment, strategy development for flexible SC, application of advance technology and IT tools, information sharing in SC members, trust development among supply chain members have emerged as major driving factors. Logistics and warehouse management, suppliers flexibility, distribution flexibility and manufacturing flexibility have emerged as dependent factors. Research limitations/implications: Framework developed in this study is based on interpretive structural modelling. This framework can be further validated with some case analysis and empirical findings. Originality/value: Findings of the study can be useful for industry professionals to develop strategies for flexible supply chains. It will help them in taking new initiatives for making supply chains more responsive and proactive for customers demand. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In the era of globalisation, requirements of customer are changing very fast. Product life cycle is shortening. Organisations are under pressure to reduce cost, delivery time, improve reliability of product by changing their process continuously. Supply chain management has become integral part of strategy for most of the organisations in meeting these challenges. Success of supply chain depends on effective strategy for improving coordination among the members to make it more responsive for market needs by optimising available resources. In this context, supply chain needs to be flexible. Based on the literature, it is observed that overall flexibility of supply chain depends upon suppliers flexibility, manufacturing flexibility and customers flexibility. Other sub-factors affecting flexibility may be product and process design, capacity planning, logistic management, suppliers capabilities and nature of customers. This study has tried to prioritise flexibility alternatives by analytical network process approach. Input for this analysis is based on four Indian case studies, which are briefly described in the paper. These organisations had been very active in improving flexibility of their supply chains. Findings of the study report that organisations should give top priority for improving manufacturing flexibility followed by customers and suppliers flexibility. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In present era of global competition, organizations are trying to improve the effectiveness of the whole chain of organizations involved from raw material to delivery of final product to consumer. In this regard, supply chain management is playing crucial role. Uncertainty and variation in customers’ needs, call for flexibility in the supply chain. Supply chain flexibility gives an account of inter-organizational relationships. In many industries supply chain flexibility is becoming a more and more important concept for gaining competitive advantages. By the design and use of strategic supply chain networks, significant improvements of supply chain flexibility can be achieved to improve overall flexibility of supply chain. Without analyzing the supply chain flexibility adequately, it is difficult to manage and organize the flow of material and information necessary for coordination in supply chain.

abstract={An outbreak of deadly COVID-19 virus has not only taken the lives of people but also severely crippled the economy. Due to strict lockdown, the manufacturing and logistics activities have been suspended, and it has affected the demand and supply of various products as a result of restrictions imposed on shopkeepers and retailers. Impacts of COVID-19 are observed ubiquitously in every type of units from different sectors. In this study, a simulation model of the public distribution system (PDS) network is developed with three different scenarios to demonstrate disruptions in the food supply chain. Difficulties have been increased in matching supply and demand in a vast network of PDS because of changing scenarios with the growth of infected cases and recovery. This paper also highlights the importance of a resilient supply chain during a pandemic. Our proposed simulation model can help in developing a resilient and responsive food supply chain to match the varying demand, and then further assist in providing decision-making support for rerouting the vehicles as per travel restrictions in areas.

abstract={Today’s scenario of manufacturing and supply chain is full of uncertainty because of numerous types of disruptions and failures such as fire, storm, machine failure, are a few names. Always supply chain disruptions present disastrous impacts, although probabilities of happening are low. In the recent robust as well as flexible supply chain has captured the focus of researchers in designing a supply chain network with consideration of disruption’s risk. In this work, an ontology-based decision support system is proposed to intensify the supply chain resilience during a disruption. The concept of semantic and ontology is adopted in developing the knowledge base for the entire supply chain network including manufacturing units. Protégé is used for defining the classes and sub-classes along with numerous types of properties and expressed in a rule-based system using semantic web rule language (SWRL). Furthermore, a mixed integer linear programming model with an objective of maximising quantified resilience to fulfil the demand.

abstract={Supply chains operating in informal sector of emerging economies are mostly characterised by inefficiencies, highly price sensitive customers, fragmented markets, frequent operational disturbances, and members with irrational profit seeking behaviour (naïve members). We focus on cost disturbances and measure their effects in terms of demand variation (QV) in muti-echelon informal supply chain. We show how naïve members contribute to amplification and transmission of QV across the supply chain. Strategic members (characterised by rational profit seeking behaviour) on the contrary, dampens the transmission of QV. Efficient reconfiguration solutions are proposed which minimize the QV for a specific cost disturbance scenario. Rational profit seeking behaviour is one of the criteria for selecting members in this reconfiguration. Rapid reconfiguration in these supply chains is possible due to the existence of informal contracts. A robust deviation reconfiguration solution is also proposed which performs satisfactorily over entire disturbance scenario set. Goodness of this solution is evaluated according to two metrics; namely cost penalty and robust efficiency. Lastly, an illustrative case study on apparel supply chain is presented and it is inferred from the discussion that large aggregators are both cost and robust efficient, hence their presence in supply chain improves performance of robust solution along the two metrics (cost penalty, robust efficiency). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The logistics and supply chain management for agricultural supply chain in Thailand has been more emphasized by both private and public sectors due to its importance to the national economy. The key performance indicators of agricultural supply chain traditionally consider three major dimensions including cost, lead time, and reliability. However, the supply chain flexibility which is an important indicator to assess the ability of all players in the agricultural supply chain can accommodate the additional demand is rarely explored. The objective of this study is to develop a mathematical programming model to assess the supply chain flexibility for cassava business. In this study, a stochastic programming approach is adopted for modeling the flexibility. The proposed model was divided into two stages. The first stage (BASE) evaluates the demand base pattern along the cassava supply chain networks. The second stage (ADD-VOL) is to assess the reserve capacity using the base pattern obtained from the first stage. The reserved capacity at each stage presents the flexibility of the supply chain that can accommodate additional demand. The proposed models could be used to identify the bottlenecks of the supply chain in order to enhance its capacity for better serving the future supply and demand changes. © 2017 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.

abstract={In recent years, remarkable advancements have been achieved in quantitative analysis methods for supply chain design (SCD). Typically, cost or service level optimisation has been included in the objective functions. At the same time, supply chain managers face the ripple effect that arises from vulnerability, instability and disruptions in supply chains. This research aimed to quantify the ripple effect in the supply chain from the structural perspective. The research agenda of this study includes issues of integrating operability objectives as new key performance indicators, e.g. resilience, stability, robustness into SCD decisions. The research is based on a simultaneous consideration of both static structural properties of SCD and execution dynamics subject to uncertainty and disruptions. Due to high dimensionality of real SCD problems, such integration can hardly be implemented in only one model. In this study, an original two-model multi-criteria approach is proposed in order to assess the potential ability of an SCD to remain stable and resilient. This modelling approach is based on a combined application of a static and a dynamic model. A multi-criteria approach relies on the analytic hierarchy process method. The results of this research can be used as an additional quantitative analysis tool in order to select an SCD. An additional application of the developed method is that it can be used at the control stage in order to adapt supply chain execution subject to the achievement of desired economic performance. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={Purpose – So far, the author lacks a comprehensive definition of military supply chain (SC) flexibility, as well as performance measures to evaluate it. This paper aims to address these gaps. It seeks to develop performance measures to assess the flexibility of a military SC. Design/methodology/approach – Volume flexibility is measured as the coefficient of variation of the demand quantity. Delivery side is measured in two stages using two ratios: customer satisfaction ratio and delivery flexibility ratio. Findings – Building on the flexibility literature, novel performance measures were developed to assess the volume flexibility (the ability to change the level of moved products) and delivery flexibility (the ability to meet short lead times). Research limitations/implications – This study characterizes the behaviour of a military SC by focusing on the volume and delivery sides. Efficiency, for example, is not within the scope of this analysis. Practical implications – The results of this paper could serve as a means to compare between SCs with drastically different sizes. Originality/value – This paper presents a novel ways to examine the flexibility of a military distribution process. The developed measures of flexibility are relevant, simple, dimensionless, and action-oriented. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Customer-centered systems used in real life have multiple states of operation called multi-states and their behavior is modeled by components which have multi-states as well. Systems degrade over time, and this degradation could be to the next state of operation (minor degradation) or to any other lower state (major degradation). System design is becoming more and more complex so there is an increasing interest in highly reliable infrastructure systems, communication systems, transportation and supply chain systems. Dynamic reliability bounds on customer-centered performance measures are presented which are useful for decision making and risk analysis. Performance measures are evaluated based on the expected length of time spent at each state of the system with the intention of capturing the customer's experience with the system. Upper and lower bounds are proposed because they are easier to compute compared with the exact value, which becomes computationally complex as the states of the system and states of the components increase. The disutility function is incorporated in the analysis because it captures preferences from the customer's point of view. For modeling system degradation, the homogeneous continuous time Markov process is used and an application related to infrastructure is presented.},

abstract={The main purpose of the current study is to examine the supply chain integration, and product modularity as antecedents of the market valuation. The study is carried out on the supply chain of the solar industry of Thailand. The reason why the solar industry is chosen is that the greater emphasis on rising oil prices, global regulatory environment, and climate change resulted in increased adoption of clean technology processes. Over the next few decades, the solar energy would be considered as an important technology stemming from fast-paced innovation and huge technological investment. Being an infant industry, the solar energy supply chain is evolving rapidly with the entrance of new as well as already established firms. The study has used the SEM-PLS to analyses the data gathered from the firms in the solar industry. The findings of the study argue that the aggregated product modularity affects the supply chain flexibility and supply chain's ability of delivering product variety, across the supply chain. Such aggregated product modularity, being an important SC construct, shows the product modularity of supply chain as a whole. © 2020 ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

abstract={Purpose: Catastrophic supply chain disruptions can significantly damage the operational and financial performance of firms. While a growing body of literature on supply network structures has studied what influences supply networks' vulnerability to supply chain disruptions and capability to recover from them, it remains unclear how supply network structures change after major supply chain disruptions. We aim to provide an understanding of how these changes occur. Design/methodology/approach: Using a natural experiment approach and supply network data from Factset, this study investigates how firms' supply network structures change after experiencing the catastrophic supply chain disruptions caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We capture post-earthquake supply network changes using the measures of degree centrality and ego network density. Findings: The results of the analysis suggest that compared to unaffected firms, the affected firms experience changes in their supply network structures tending toward lower complexity measured by in-degree centrality, out-degree centrality and ego network density. Originality/value: This study contributes to social network theory and the complex adaptive supply network literature by providing empirical evidence of structural changes in supply networks after catastrophic supply chain disruptions. A managerial contribution is made by providing a reflection on why these changes might be occurring and alert firms to the challenges of managing complexity in their supply networks. © 2020, Byung-Gak Son, Sangho Chae and Canan Kocabasoglu-Hillmer.},

abstract={After a disaster happens, emergency response operations are critical to save humans’ lives and properties. The limited resources and time requirements call for coordinated supply chain operations. This paper studies supply chain operations for rescue kits in disaster reliefs, motivated by a real-world application. The objective is to minimise the total tardiness and peak tardiness of product delivery over the multi-period planning horizon. One major challenge is the lack of reliable prediction of customer demand in disasters. In order to cope with demand uncertainty while maintaining the tractability of the optimisation model, we decompose the demand into two components: a relatively stable base demand predicted by historical data and unpredictable demand surges. For the base demand, an optimisation model is developed to optimise the production and distribution operations, as well as the inventory replenishment policy for manufacturers and distribution centres, so as to minimise the total tardiness. For the demand surges, we propose to deploy supply chain flexibility to cope with the uncertainty. An empirical study shows the effectiveness of increasing supply chain flexibility and suggests some managerial insights on configuring such flexibility in emergency operations. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Epidemic blockade leads to increased uncertainty and dynamic supply network disruption. This study considers an uncertain optimization of dynamic supply networks with risk preference and order delivery disruption. Taking the subjective utility of downstream enterprises as a reference point for the utility measurement of order delivery disruption and risk preference, this study constructs a biobjective optimization model with the goal of maximizing the downstream firm's subjective utility and minimizing the manufacturer's cost. The influence of each parameter in the downstream firm's subjective utility function on the integrated optimization was analysed. The research found that the uncertain optimization model with the risk preference of downstream firms for order delivery disruption better controls the actual manufacturer's order allocation and distribution problems when considering the downstream firms' behaviour preference characteristics under bounded rationality. When allocating orders, manufacturers should consider that changes in order delivery disruption will cause changes in the subjective utility of downstream enterprises. In the process of multiperiod cooperation between manufacturers and downstream firms, they can obtain downstream firm risk preferences through repeated investigations. © 2021 Yang Song et al.},

Discovering good services is a very important step for building a dynamic supply chain. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines agent and web services technologies. Our proposed framework lies firstly on the classification and selection mechanism that permits to select the best services which can satisfy the customers’ goals and reduce the response time cost. The main idea is to use concepts as multi-agent systems and web services to perform the different activities of a supply chain management system. The essential part of the framework is the UDDI cloud level and the agent level. The UDDI cloud level allows web services, which represent enterprises’ business functionalities, to be classified, discovered, invoked, and composed by agents that are applied for supply chain management construction and partner’s interaction. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

abstract={There is a need to identify and categorise different types of nonlinearities that commonly appear in supply chain dynamics models, as well as establishing suitable methods for linearising and analysing each type of nonlinearity. In this paper simplification methods to reduce model complexity and to assist in gaining system dynamics insights are suggested. Hence, an outcome is the development of more accurate simplified linear representations of complex nonlinear supply chain models.  We use the highly cited Forrester production-distribution model as a benchmark supply chain system to study nonlinear control structures and apply appropriate analytical control theory methods. We then compare performances of the linearised model with numerical solutions of the original nonlinear model and with other previous research on the same model.  Findings suggest that more accurate linear approximations can be found. These simplified and linearised models enhance the understanding of the system dynamics and transient responses, especially for inventory and shipment responses.  A systematic method is provided for the rigorous analysis and design of nonlinear supply chain dynamics models, especially when overly simplistic linear relationship assumptions are not possible or appropriate. This is a precursor to robust control system optimisation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In order to remain competitive in the market, firms are forced to expand their product offerings and offer high levels of customization, bringing about high uncertainty in their supply chain. Firms that face high environmental uncertainty are increasingly facing higher risks in terms of supply disruptions, production and delivery delays that ultimately result in poor operational performance. This study aims at understanding the antecedents of supply chain operational risk faced by firms and the conditions under which such risks can be mitigated. Using Indian data from the sixth edition of International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS) and structural equation modeling, we investigate the relationships between environmental uncertainty and supply chain risk and the moderating effect of supply chain flexibility. We identify appropriate types of flexibility to mitigate the three major aspects of supply chain risk: supply risk, manufacturing process risk and delivery risk. Our empirical investigation reveals that uncertainty in the supply chain leads to high supply chain risk; and in uncertain environments, supply and manufacturing flexibility help in reducing the supply and manufacturing process risks respectively. However, our results also indicate that, in emerging markets such as India where logistic infrastructure is less developed, internal capabilities alone may not be sufficient in reducing supply chain delivery risk. Our findings not only contribute towards filling certain gaps in the supply chain risk management literature, but also provide practicing managers and researchers a better understanding of the types of flexibility that can mitigate supply chain risk in different business environments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Supply chain management is reflected through SCM1 which indicates the supply chain production flexibility as measured through five items, whereas SCM2 represents the supply chain sourcing flexibility as observed through five items too. For measuring the business performance, three items were added in the study. For the data collection purpose, we have focused on the questionnaire survey technique based on the stated items of both supply chain dimension and performance measures too. Overall data is recorded through a scaling method of five points, where one shows strongly disagree and five shows strongly agree about a particular statement. A sample of 247 respondents of different suppliers and key individuals who were somehow engage with supply chain of pharmaceutical companies were targeted for the data collection. Additionally, our results have considered the age, gender, and working experience as main demographic factors. For data analysis, descriptive results through frequency distribution of the respondents and cross tabulation of the demographic factors were provided and explained. In addition, our study has observed the factors loadings through confirmatory factor analysis for checking the internal reliability of each of the item, whereas overall conceptual framework is observed through structural equation modelling. Results of the study show that there is a significant and positive impact of supply chain production flexibility and supply chain sourcing flexibility on the performance measures of pharmaceutical companies as working in Thailand. As per originality, it was found that very little research has expatriate the supply chain flexibly in terms of production and outsourcing as a performance determinants of pharma industry were observed. Therefore, it is stated that present research is a significant contribution in the literature for various stakeholders. However, future studies may incorporate the other supply chain dynamics like postponement flexibility, key types of the suppliers (Captain category and secondary suppliers) for examining the business performance in pharma sector. © Advanced Scientific Research.

abstract={Purpose: The paper identifies the antecedents and consequences of integrated supply chain performance (ISCP) in healthcare systems. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a review of the literature constructs of supply chain flexibility (SCF), employee relationships (ERs), organizational orientation (OO) and knowledge exchange (KE) were identified as antecedents of ISCP, and patient centricity (PC) emerged as its consequence. This structural relationship was tested using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: ERs, SCF, OO and KE positively impacted the performance of an integrated healthcare supply chain. Furthermore, enhanced ISCP in operational processes of the hospital positively influenced patient centeredness and care quality. Research limitations/implications: Paper contributes by identifying antecedents and consequences of ISCP. Future researchers may explore the inter-relationships among the antecedents of ISCP. Practical implications: Insights from this study will help practitioners in enhancing hospital operations by integrating processes along the healthcare service supply chain and developing a patient-centric approach. Social implications: This paper highlights how PC may be achieved by focusing on a facilitative internal environment. This understanding may help in designing processes that deliver health as a social good in an effective manner.

In this work, we instead focus on supporting the more powerful SkyMapJoin queries. Our Adaptive-SKIN framework conducts processing at two levels of abstraction thereby effectively minimizing the two primary costs, namely the cost of generating join results and the cost of dominance comparisons to compute the final skyline of the join results. Our proposed approach hinges on two key principles. First, in the input space - Adaptive-SKIN determines the abstraction levels dynamically at run time instead of assigning a static one at compile time. This is achieved by adaptively partitioning the input data driven by the feedback of the results already generated. Second, Adaptive-SKIN incrementally build the output space, containing the final skyline, without generating a single join result. Our approach selectively drills into regions in the output space that show promise in generating result tuples as well as avoiding the generation of intermediate results that do not contribute to the query result. In this effort, we propose a cost-vs.-benefit driven strategy for abstraction selection. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the Adaptive-SKIN over state-of-the-art techniques over benchmark data. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={If you go to a supermarket or a branch of Wal-Mart and pick up a few items off the shelf from food and beverages, to electronics, packaging, plastic products, or even clothes, and look to see where each was made, the chances are that you will find that these items have been manufactured in a foreign country, and most likely in a developing country. Emerging markets are redefining the way demand and supply are managed. Simultaneously, global companies are driven by markets across the continents, where they are constantly looking to set up production centers where costs of raw materials and labor can be kept low. The sourcing of raw materials, and the ability to obtain the right quality and quantity of a product and at the right price calls for dynamic supply chain strategy. © Urs P.

abstract={Agile supply chain analytics is about ability to adapt business intelligence (BI) systems to meet the changing needs of the supply network and its environment. Agile BI incorporates both technical and process-oriented approach to development, management, and delivery of BI solutions. To achieve agile BI, supply chains must provide and establish the necessary infrastructure, architecture, tools and processes in a way that enables them to deliver BI systems capable of quickly and effectively adapting to the rapidly changing business needs and environment factors. However, most supply chains still lack methods, processes and tools to successfully design and implement these systems. The paper first provides an analysis of current situation and a concise background research, followed by the introduction of the integrated and adaptive supply chain business intelligence model. This model enables design of pervasive analytical systems for collaborative decision-making, monitoring and management of the supply network. The main components of the model are described, as well as the architecture and features of the specialized supply chain intelligence web portal which demonstrates usefulness and applicability of the proposed model. This system allows creation of a new breed of flexible and agile BI systems which ultimately results in more efficient, responsive and adaptive supply chains. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Today's business climate requires supply chains to be proactive rather than reactive, which demands a new approach that incorporates data mining predictive analytics. This paper introduces a predictive supply chain performance management model which combines process modelling, performance measurement, data mining models, and web portal technologies into a unique model. It presents the supply chain modelling approach based on the specialized metamodel which allows modelling of any supply chain configuration and at different level of details. The paper also presents the supply chain semantic business intelligence (BI) model which encapsulates data sources and business rules and includes the data warehouse model with specific supply chain dimensions, measures, and KPIs (key performance indicators). Next, the paper describes two generic approaches for designing the KPI predictive data mining models based on the BI semantic model. KPI predictive models were trained and tested with a real-world data set. Finally, a specialized analytical web portal which offers collaborative performance monitoring and decision making is presented. The results show that these models give very accurate KPI projections and provide valuable insights into newly emerging trends, opportunities, and problems. This should lead to more intelligent, predictive, and responsive supply chains capable of adapting to future business environment. © 2014 Nenad Stefanovic.},

abstract={In the ongoing decade, port logistics in Europe have been exposed to intense competition. Especially container ports experience competition not only for ships but also for supply chains. To adapt to this trend, terminal operators are improving the efficiency in port logistics through, among other things, automation of port operations. Most of these efforts concern processes handling shipped goods. Instead of concentrating on these well-researched improvements, we explored the feasibility and economic potential of an intelligent lighting control system. Often automating handling processes need high investments in hard- and software. This smart lighting system is supposed to control demand-actuated outdoor lights in a harbour environment. In this research, movement profiles of straddle carriers and infrastructural data were gathered and refined to build a model of the observed container terminal. The modelled infrastructure includes the position of every lighting tower and its illuminant as well as their specific power consumption and the respective area, which those lights illume. To control these lights, we developed a control algorithm. We investigated through simulation experiments the power savings for this autonomous lighting control system. Multiple influential factors of this control concept were evaluated by varying the parameterization of the algorithm. A gathered data set, containing trajectories of operating straddle carriers during full terminal utilization, is the basis for the mentioned experiments. The results of varying the utilization rate of the terminal have identified a relationship between capacity and percental power consumption, in the form of a root function. The more straddle carriers run, the less the overall power consumption is increasing. Using the intelligent light control system on full utilization saves 14.67% of the total energy. In the case of 80 % terminal utilization, 18.22 % of total energy is subject for saving effects. Besides these results, we were able to explore the influences of the algorithm parameterization on the energy savings and could assess these solutions economically. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={In recent years, corporate social responsibility (CSR) has benefited from a renewed interest in supply chains. However, little scholarly attention has been paid to the CSR practices in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)’ supply chains that lie beyond the first-tier supplier. Drawing from the dynamic capabilities perspective, the purpose of this study is twofold: first, to examine how SMEs extend CSR into their multi-tier supply chain (MSC); and second, to investigate the drivers of and the barriers to this process. A multiple-case study was conducted to examine six triadic relationships of SMEs including sub-suppliers. We performed within-case and cross-case analyses. The study shows that SMEs use ‘co-evolving’ or ‘reflexive control’ capabilities to extend CSR to the SME first-tier supplier. The findings reveal that, in contrast, SMEs use ‘active delegation’, ‘supply chain re-conceptualization’ capabilities or a ‘don’t bother’ approach to extend CSR to the SME second-tier supplier. Besides, our study shows that the type of internal drivers (instrumental or normative) determines the dynamic capabilities implemented at the first-tier and at the second-tier supplier level, while external drivers are weak and the barriers are primarily internal. © 2018, 2018 KEDGE Business School.},

abstract={The electronics supply chain has adapted into a global process over the past two decades to support the cost of process optimization. As the semiconductor industry has transitioned from a vertical to horizontal business model, the perceived vulnerability of integrated circuit (IC) design and fabrication has grown dramatically. Design intellectual property (IP) is the defining characteristic of most fabless design houses and integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) within the supply chain, and as such, holds significant value for market competitiveness, and in some cases, national security. Malicious insiders threaten the confidentiality of this proprietary technology. To prevent IP piracy, we redefine the modern threat landscape by considering nearly every individual in the IC design and fabrication process untrusted. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to assure confidential electronic design against insider threats, termed ACED-IT, that enables maintaining the confidentiality of the design when it traverses through different design stages (e.g., RTL/Gate-level to GDSII). ACED-IT integrates encryption, logic locking, novel temporary-inserted logic elements (TILEs), access controls, and action logging, to protect the design IP from insider threats originating from any entity in the process. ACED-IT is compatible with the current industry development flow and provides all engineers with the tools to complete their roles. The proposed ACED-IT framework is demonstrated across various benchmarks and analyzed for security. Benchmarks processed using ACED-IT incurred negligible overhead across parameters such as power, area, timing, and test coverage after functional recovery, and provided a brute force attack complexity to recover the original design exceeding that of AES-256.

abstract={Prior research into flexibility has largely focused on intra-organisational aspects of manufacturing flexibility or looked at the role of manufacturing companies in flexible supply chains - it has generally failed to explicitly consider the role of services. This paper presents the results of an exploratory empirical study into service flexibility based on interviews conducted in six companies: a recruitment agency, a plant hire firm, two logistics providers, a procurement service, and a provider of supply chain software. Many of these services provide an important source of flexibility to supply chains. Five roles fulfilled by the services are identified as follows: to provide continuity, to allow for expansion, to provide expertise, to improve cost efficiency, and to reduce risk. In addition, it is found that the companies are able to play these roles through having internal flexibility (e.g., flexible resources and/or excess capacity) and by themselves supplementing this either through their membership of a parent organisation/group (group collaboration) or through external partners (e.g., subcontracting and horizontal collaboration). Future research could build on this contribution, e.g., by conducting an integrated study of a network of manufacturing and service firms, by conducting a quantitative survey to add generality to the findings, and by conducting longitudinal empirical work to observe how supply chains cope with change over time.

abstract={Purpose-Firms within industrial clusters are subject to challenges such as globalization, limited resources, volatility of international markets and financial instabilities. 4th party logistics (4PL) service providers are supporting individual firms to overcome such challenges by using collaborative operational capabilities from within an industrial cluster to their enhance competitiveness. The purpose of this paper is to focus on China and proposes a collaborative operational capabilities framework to illustrate the role of 4PL in industrial cluster competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach-The paper follows an extensive literature review and structured interviews in two types of clusters, drawing on resource-based view and importance-performance matrix analysis. Findings-The paper proposes six elements (that is, synergy of logistics, expansion of industrial chain, financial ability, creativity and innovation ability, cooperation of companies and flexibility of supply chain) that comprise collaborative operational capabilities, and highlights the role of "creativity and innovation ability" and "supply chain flexibility" in the use of 4PL for industrial cluster competitiveness in Chinese context. Research limitations/implications-The paper focusses on China and hence it could also be tested in the developed countries' context with the support of large-scale empirical data to investigate further its usefulness and to identify other constraints.

abstract={To survive in the current competitive, unpredictable business environment, it is significant for firms to search and enforce capabilities that lead them to adapt and cope with dynamic changes of environment for their sustainability. We try to connect operation issues with sustainability in this paper. From the perspective of the dynamic capabilities of the firm, this study suggests a conceptual model that presents relationships among supply chain visibility, modular design, supply chain flexibility, and agility. We do not focus on the module buyer but on the small and middle-sized enterprises (SMEs). An empirical study is performed to verify the relationships proposed, using datasets collected from 232 manufacturing SMEs as module suppliers in South Korea. We used SPSS to analyze data and structural equation modeling to verify the hypotheses of the research model. The important contributions of this study are as follows. Firstly, we suggest relationships among supply chain visibilities and a modular design for supply chain flexibility and agility in sustainable performance. Secondly, we show that supply chain visibility directly leads firms to implement modular design in sustainable development. Thirdly, we verify the importance of supply chain visibility, not for module buyers, but for module suppliers by switching views in terms of SMEs' sustainability. Lastly, this study shows that the suppliers' modular design affects supply chain flexibility and agility, which is consistent with the findings presented in the literature. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Problem definition: How to dynamically replenish inventory from two supply sources or shipping modes with general lead times. The fast source is more expensive than the slow source. Academic/practical relevance: Dual sourcing provides supply chain flexibility to mitigate demand and supply risk. Despite its relevance in practice, characterizing the optimal dual sourcing policy is extremely challenging, and the optimal stochastic policy for nonconsecutive lead times has been unknown for over 50 years. Methodology: We present and solve a robust rolling horizon model for periodically reviewed dual sourcing inventory systems that minimizes the total cost of purchasing, inventory holding, and backlogging. Results: We prove that the optimal robust policy is a dual-index, dual-base-stock policy that constrains or “caps” the slow order and provide closed-form expressions for the three control parameters. The optimality result is established for general lead times and can accommodate nonstationary demand. Our numerical study shows that, as the lead time difference grows, the capped dual index policy increasingly smooths slow orders and for stationary demand, converges to the tailored base-surge policy, which places a constant slow order and has been shown to be asymptotically optimal. Managerial implications: Our capped dual index policy is easy to understand, explain, and implement in practice. In an extensive simulation study, the capped dual index policy performs as well as and can even outperform the best heuristics presented in the stochastic inventory literature. © 2019 INFORMS.},

abstract={Globalization brings opportunities and challenges for supply chain involved companies. Supply chains may be fragile when sudden business environment fluctuations occur. Various quantitative analysis models are built to understand and mitigate supply chain risks. Dynamic Flow Bayesian Networks (DFBNs) are created by integrating Dynamic Bayesian Networks and System Dynamics to demonstrate the feedback flows of a supply chain with stochastic risks considered. However, it has limited ability in suggesting straightforward solutions for mitigating the risks. An Optimized Dynamic Flow Bayesian Network (ODFBN) incorporates mathematical optimization with the original DFBN. An ODFBN is a tool that offers business performance improvement strategies for supply chains by establishing objectives of a supply chain and constraints on the flows. Optimization-enhanced risk-influenced dynamic flow variables provide supply chain practitioners with a more effective reference for their business strategy. This paper presents an application of the ODFBN for a two-stage supply chain. Comparison between the ODFBN and the DFBN is illustrated with a discussion of preliminary modeling results.},

abstract={The increasing competition in the construction industry requires companies to cooperate and be actively involved in the dynamic management of multiple relationships and supply chains. To facilitate such dynamic supply chain management, some enterprises implement internet of things (IoT) technology and its smart devices. Through the utilisation of IoT technologies in supply chain cooperation, some enterprises have achieved the co-creation of values. However, few researchers evaluate the impacts of IoT implementation on the achievement of value co-creation in the Chinese construction context. To fill these gaps, this study concentrates on exploring the role of IoT implementation in enhancing value co-creation in terms of competency alignment (CA), behavioural alignment (BA), process alignment (PA) and congruence of expectation (CE) in Chinese supply chain collaboration. The data that informs the methodology is collected through a questionnaire and the findings illustrate that IoT implementation positively correlates with CA, BA, PA and CE.

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to address the existing research gap, as well as to explore the various types of flexibility which could contribute in mitigating supply chain risks. Methodology: In this regard, we consider three aspects under SCR namely; manufacturing process risk, delivery risk, and supply risk. The study explores the relationships among supply chain risk and environmental uncertainty, and the moderating role of supply chain flexibility by employing data of 91 manufacturing companies and develop a structural equation modelling. Results: Developing economies are contributing well in the global trade and are responsible for 50% of the generated global output. They present future prospects for economic growth and pose challenges mainly because of immature supply chain operations. Considering the critical role of emerging economies in global supply chain, such as India and China, it is also important to observe the moderating and driving supply chain risk factors in these regions. It is assumed that this study will not only fill the existing gap in the literature of SCRM but will assist researchers and practicing managers, by enabling them to fully understand certain types of supply chain flexibility, thus reducing the SCR under business environments. © Sutduean et al.},

abstract={The prime objective of the current study is to investigate the relationship between firm supply chain performance and firm performance. Meanwhile the study is also interested in investigating the moderating role of information strategy. Using a firms' knowledge-based view, it is hypothesized that higher customer, competitor, and supplier intelligence integration results in higher product innovation and supply chain adaptability. Where, intelligence integration refers to the ability of an organization to quickly modify SC in accordance with the product design and market changes; whereas, the product innovation ability refers to the proficiency of an organization to develop new and innovative products. Employing the survey-based methodology, the SEM-CBM technique is used to test the hypothesized relationships. So, the current study has used SEM-CBM as statistical tool to answer the research questions raised in this study and research objectives envisaged in the study. The findings of the study have provided support to the theoretical foundation and proposed hypothesis of the current study.

abstract={Dynamic supply chains (SC) are important to reduce inventory, enable the flow of materials, maximize profits, and minimize costs. This research work presents a capacity–inventory management model via system dynamics for a dynamic supply SC, applying model-based optimal control techniques. In the context of high-volume manufacturing (HVM) that present low variability and predictable demand, for mathematical modeling purposes, a set of coupled first-order ordinary differential equations, with an analogy from the mixing problem, is presented, which relates capacity and inventory levels, taking into account a production rate at each node of interaction. The application of ordinary differential equations via the mixing problem (or compartmental analysis) is important based on the idea of a balance between the influx and outflux of raw material along the supply chain. A proper literature review on optimal control for supply chains is analyzed. The mathematical model introduced is presented in a linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space formulation. Stability analysis for the dynamic serial SC is presented, and a sensitivity analysis is also conducted for the capacity and production rate parameters considering the effects of variations in parameters along the SC. An energy-based optimal control is also developed with proper simulations. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={As new approaches, the dynamic alignment concept and the sustainable supply chain management paradigms are significantly impacting academia and the business environment. The dynamic alignment preconizes that companies should dynamically manage different types of supply chains (e.g. fully flexible, agile, lean, and continuous replenishment) in order to respond appropriately to various types of customers' behaviours. The sustainable supply chain management approach supports that the design and management of these different types of supply chains should take into account various environmental and social issues as complements to the traditional economic criteria. In a recent study, some authors combine these two trends in a novel conceptual model aiming to help decision-makers to better manage different environmental trade-offs when designing supply chain using the dynamic alignment concept. This paper presents some experimental studies in 'agile' supply chain in order to verify some of the assumptions made by the model. Simulation experiments were conducted in a large multinational company producing non-durable consumer goods. Results provide evidence that the proposed model is consistent and has the potential to help companies to design agile and green supply chains.},

The IMA sits between the RFID infrastructure and the existing supply chain systems and continuously monitors the current activities and wraps services from existing systems to increase the flexibility for immediate process restructuring. A comparison was made between two types of deviations that occurred at the early and final stages of a customization process with and without IMA support.

abstract={Lean is a management philosophy to eliminate waste both in the inside and from the outside of factories. A supply chain strategy is a key issue for the improvement of the outside. Recent information technologies provide even small- and medium-sized supplier companies with a chance for entering into contracts with major supplier companies and large manufacturing companies in different Keiretsu groups, but will give the trouble for surviving in the dynamic supply chain environment at the same time. This chapter proposes a strategy for MTO (Make To Order) companies to find suitable business partners in the dynamic supply chain environment and to enter into proper contracts with the partners as well as to obtain appropriate profits. A supply chain model proposed in the chapter provides a negotiation protocol to determine suitable prices and delivery times for ordered products through the iteration of the negotiation process between the organizations, as well as through the modification processes of production schedules. A twolayered supply chain model is firstly proposed as a basic model for dynamic supply chain management of MTO companies. The model is extended to a three-layered supply chain model for representing the negotiation protocol among multi-layered organizations. A prototype of a supply chain simulation system is developed and computational experiments are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of changing business partners and negotiating among the partners cooperatively. © 2014, IGI Global.

abstract={Supply chain management has been investigated for the configuring and controlling of material and information flows among different organizations. The trend has been toward even more flexible or dynamic supply chains to find suitable business partners and enter into profitable contracts. Previous studies have proposed a two-layered supply chain model consisting of two kinds of organization: clients and suppliers. This study proposes a new model representing multi-layered dynamic supply chains and a negotiation protocol in multi-layered organizations. The organizations in the middle-layers generate both orders of parts for suppliers and offers of products for clients. Production schedules in the middle-layers continue to be modified after orders are sent to suppliers. Suppliers simultaneously generate and modify sets of production schedules for individual orders to find the most profitable order of all. The effectiveness of the model and the negotiation protocol is evaluated through computational experiments.},

abstract={With the ongoing development of DX, the linkage between physical and cyber environments is expanding and is increasingly being applied to business aspects such as supply chains. At the same time, cyber-attacks are becoming more diversified, and information security is becoming more and more important. The Information Security White Paper 2019 reported that one of the most pressing issues in the supply chain is that the scope of responsibility between the contractor and subcontractor is unclear. In this paper, we propose a two-tier trust structure model featuring inter-organizational security policy matching for dynamic supply chains that recombines subcontractors for each contract. The proposed structure consists of a trust model at the contractor side and a zero-trust model between the contractor and the subcontractor. The results of qualitative evaluation show that this two-tier model can help clarify the scope of responsibility in dynamic supply chains. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Overview The last four decades have seen an explosion of open architecture electronics, computers, social media, modular operating systems, sensors, communication links, etc., all based on standardized highly certified and cost effective modules provided by a responsive supply chain. Virtually no progress of a similar nature for electro-mechanical systems (orthotics, aircraft, vehicles, surgery, manufacturing cells, etc.) has occurred [1]. A companion paper [2] on the Next Wave of Technology shows that the previous electronics wave was necessary to prepare the foundation to this emerging technology to continuously enhance performance-to-cost ratios for a very wide range of applications that form the core of the discipline of mechanical engineering. Major government agencies (especially in Europe and the U.S.) have begun to structure their programs on "popular" ideas reinforced by the news media. Solid science for a multitude of electro-mechanical applications (see the NWT paper) is being displaced in favor of cloud computing, big data, neuro-science, nano-science, etc. The result is now becoming severe. The weakness of any one technology (in this case, the mechanicals) forms a weak link to make the resulting systems of technologies weak. The large failed investment of $30 billion for the Future Combat System (FCS) by the Army is proof of this continuing and growing imbalance. In this paper, we illustrate this large view development objective by concentrating on open architecture vehicles. As may be understood, only a portion of the required development can be described in this short paper. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The pharmaceutical industry faces multiple challenges (e.g., inefficient manufacturing techniques, quality control issues, and supply chain vulnerabilities) because of its current batch-wise approach to manufacturing. Recent regulatory support for continuous manufacturing and advances in continuous process technologies have caused an increase in interest from some drug manufacturers to modernize their production processes. However, many of these companies have focused on hybrid processes, where only certain steps are continuous, while others remain batch. Herein, the quality by design (QbD)-based design strategy and operation of an end-to-end integrated continuous manufacturing (ICM) pilot plant that produces both small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and oral solid dosages (OSDs) are discussed. Additionally, important quality and economic matters pertaining to scale-up and commercialization are addressed. ICM has significant benefits, including better quality control, increased supply chain flexibility, a lower capital investment (in the example provided, a ∼90% reduction), and lower operating costs (in the example provided, a 33.6% reduction for API and 29.4% reduction for tablets). © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

To this end, we propose a generic two-echelon supply chain with an emergency backup supplier, which is modeled using control engineering approach. The simulation study is carried out for both frequent-but-short and rare-but-long disruptions to evaluate its impact under the emergency sourcing strategy, with long-term profit and backlog of the supply chain firm as performance measures. The study provides insights into parameter settings and potential trade-offs involved in designing an emergency sourcing strategy. Further, the results for the frequent-but-short scenario show that a trade-off between improvement in service level and long-term profitability of the firm exists, which is affected by cost, response time and spare capacity of the backup supplier. As for the rare-but-long scenario, the trade-off is between preparedness and recovery actions. © 2020, © 2020 Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineers.},

abstract={Over the past two decades, the scope of some key subjects in operations management has extended beyond the single company to include supply chain (SC) partners and their interactions. One example of such an extension is the contemporary concept of supply chain flexibility (SCF). Although there has been considerable academic progress on SCF, most of the previous studies on this topic have been confined to a single firm, thereby neglecting other important aspects of a supply chain. Therefore, the development of empirical multi-tier studies capable of investigating the inter-organisational components of SCF is required. Within this context, this paper has the purpose of exploring the main effects of flexible SC capabilities or their lack at various tiers that limit the SC's ability to provide products to end-customers. The research design was a multiple case study with internal and external validity checks, within-case analysis and cross-case comparisons, based on a research framework that scrutinises the relationships between SC contextual constraints and flexibility types. The study took place in three representative SCs of the Brazilian automotive industry and sought mainly to identify and compare SC contextual constraints that hinder product delivery to end-customers. Constraints such as suppliers' capacity, diversity of suppliers, suppliers' cooperation, trust and commitment, tariffs, exchange rates and inventory were identified in different supplier tiers of the OEMs as the main factors influencing the observed volume and mix flexibilities. Additionally, SCF types such as sourcing, relational, delivery, postponement, new product and responsiveness influenced the SC's flexibility provided to the end-customers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The key challenge of today's global marketplace is to respond to the competitive challenges and to develop along with to sustain the competitive advantage for the organization. This paper examines that how partnership of suppliers and customer relationship management affects competitive advantage. Moreover, mediating effect of supply chain flexibility, supply chain agility is being examined as well. The data for current research was collected from the customers of textile firms of Indonesia. For this reason, a structured questionnaire was formed by adapting items form past studies. For data analysis, Smart PLS 3.0 and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 were used. The Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) is a relatively new technique and a second-generation SEM which works well for models which consist of multiple latent variables and series of cause-and-effect associations. The research findings show that supply chain flexibility is not proven a significant mediator between suppliers' performance and competitive advantage. Also, the association between supply chain flexibility and competitive advantage is proven insignificant.

abstract={In order to stay responsive to evolving customer demands and to meet the need for greater product customizations, many manufacturing enterprises are recognizing the need to quickly reconfigure their manufacturing systems and supply chains. Making reconfiguration decisions requires a system-level optimization that involves many factors such as manufacturing tasks, outsourcing decisions, supply chain configurations, as well as risks. This paper proposes a graph-based cost model to optimize the configuration of manufacturing supply chain networks to support reconfiguration decision-making. An optimization model is formulated to minimize the total cost of the manufacturing enterprise with the consideration of operating cost and reconfiguration cost. To effectively quantify the reconfiguration cost, a graph-based cost model is developed to characterize the relationship between the graphical similarity of two supply chain networks and the reconfiguration cost. Outsourcing decisions and supply chain risks are also considered in the proposed model. A case study on a supply chain for laptop computer assembly is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

abstract={The fashion market is becoming more competitive in the luxury industry, mainly because of the appearance and strengthening of other industries that provide new products more consistently to its customers. This sector, marked by its two annual collections and its unique items, must become more flexible and provide a faster response to its consumer base. In this context, supply chain management is an important factor in determining the degree of competitiveness of a company. This paper proposes tools to assist in the production scheduling of a luxury industry through making its supply chain more flexible by reducing the number of items delivered before the release, thus allowing the company to react according to the sales. To achieve that, an approach to the calculation of orders based on sales forecasts and on the lead time between stores and distribution centers was devel- oped, in addition to a tool to control the delivery of the items through better integration with the suppliers. The proposed approach reduced the number of items in the first two orders by 17 and 12%, and several delays were avoided through the utilization of the order-control tool. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Purpose – Changes are inevitable in risky and uncertain business environments of today’s volatile supply chains. The concept of flexibility originates from this need to mitigate the ill-effects of risks and uncertainty in supply chains. In this paper, an attempt is made to present an exhaustive review on supply chain flexibility (SCF) and its implementation to gain strategic advantages. Design/methodology/approach – A citation analysis method is employed in this paper to discuss, analyse and apprehend the conceptual, empirical, analytical and simulation studies done in this field. In this paper, about 110 papers on flexibility from many reputed journals are examined to study and assimilate various aspects of flexibility. Findings – SCF embraces a unified process-based view including the core processes such as procurement, sourcing, distribution and logistics and mitigates uncertainty or risks involved. The review helps to assimilate the key knowledge about relevant practices in SCF and helps to draw implementing strategies while offering managerial insight on the subject. Research limitations/implications – Citation and co-citation analysis is done to review the SCF literature. Efforts are made to investigate relevant papers from various journals regarding its ability to mitigate risk or aid in making strategic decision. The study, however, is limited to certain industries in the papers as per chosen approach here. The strategies described in here may further be verified by the researchers and practitioners pertaining to their study or industries focused. Practical implications – It provides managerial insight for practitioners on how to use flexibility within the firm and across supply chain while considering various trade-offs. Originality/value – This paper is unique as a review paper, as it encompasses various kinds of studies done on SCF from conceptual models to mathematical models. Further, it briefs with the current practices in industries/SC towards being flexible. It talks of various trade-offs in pursuit of flexibility and concludes while suggesting numerous research gaps and opening new dimensions for SCF research. It offers many managerial and academic implications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In this paper an attempt is made to evaluate procurement flexibility at supplier buyer interface in disastrous scenarios. This can be considered to be an extension of research work carried out by Das and Abdel-Malek (2003). This paper contributes by analysing supply chain disruptions in extremely risky environments that are coupled with uncertainties in demand and lead times from downstream. These uncertainties are captured by a probability density functions, more precisely the normal distributions. A flexibility measure ψ is designed which not only ensures timely supply of material from the supplier but also ensures to maintain a continuous supply at minimal risk to buyer in case of complete disruptions at supplier's production sites. As this flexibility measure ψ varies from 0 to 1, it reflects a 0 to 100% flexibility of supplier from buyers' viewpoint. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Supply chain flexibility (SCF) is being viewed most important among the tools to counter and handle risks and uncertainties in today's volatile markets. It may also be considered to plan strategies, in order to gain competitive edge over competitors. Recently extensive work is being reported in SCF focussing mainly on its multi dimensional aspects and implementation. However SCF is no free lunch and it may require huge investments to realise its potential benefits. 'How much flexibility is required', thus becomes the prime concern for firms willing to be flexible. This question is rarely discussed in the literature and in its scarcity, flexibility performance measurements remains untouched for risky and uncertain environments. Therefore measuring SCF is a prominent field where research needs to be focused. In this paper a mathematical model is proposed to evaluate supply chain flexibility at supplier buyer interface with an aim to attain robust supply in all possible scenarios. Further cost of procurement in view of flexibility is investigated in disastrous scenarios to support procurement decisions by managers. The paper contributes by analysing and evaluating SCF in environment of demand and lead time uncertainties and risks of major plant disruptions. © Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management 2013.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this research is to investigate the combination of relational and organizational resource factors that influence small-to-medium-sized firm satisfaction with their supply chain portfolio performance. Design/methodology/approach - This research employs two complementary theoretical lenses frequently used in the explanation of relationship performance, resource-based view of the firm and strategic behavior theory. The authors then used an international survey based in three Northern European countries to test their hypotheses with hierarchical linear regression. Findings - The quantitative analysis supports all three hypotheses indicating that supply chain portfolio flexibility is an important determinant for small-to-medium-sized firm satisfaction with supply chain portfolio performance. Additionally, firm alliance orientation and entrepreneurial orientation both significantly influence the relationship between supply chain flexibility and performance satisfaction. Research limitations/implications - This research is limited by the categorization of the supply chain portfolio flexibility types as high and low resource linkages by the researchers. Future research may look at additional ways to measure individual agreements and have firms categorize them according to resource requirements. However, the findings of this research provide a theoretical and empirical foundation through the application of resource-based view of the firm and strategic behavior theory for future research in the area of small-to-medium-sized firms and their satisfaction with supply chain portfolios. Practical implications - Important managerial implications are found for small to medium-sized firms and larger firms that work with them when managing portfolio satisfaction. This research indicates that it makes sense for managers to consider categorizing supply chain relationships similar to the way they categorize their end-user relationships. This allows small-to-medium-sized firms across the portfolio to be segmented into groups where appropriate relationship maintenance can take place and where more suitable satisfaction goals can be defined in terms of operational metrics. Originality/value - The framework developed in this paper provides insights on small-to-medium-sized firm satisfaction with supply chain portfolio performance.

abstract={Supply chain management has become one of the focal points of competition nowadays. The importance of information sharing in supply chain management is also increasing in terms of business performance improvement. In this study, five different models were developed to investigate the effect of information sharing in the supply chain process of businesses on cost, flexibility, response, delivery and financial performance. The relationships among these models are examined by means of a structural equation model (SEM). This paper is focused on supply chain process, supply chain flexibility, environmental uncertainties and information sharing latent structures whose cumulative effects on the determined performance indicators have been examined. The survey data obtained from the companies within the scope of the ISO (Istanbul Chamber of Industry) 1000 were used in the analyses conducted, whose results proved that all the suggested models were adequate in terms of validity and reliability. Furthermore, it was determined in all models that environmental uncertainties affect the supply chain process, while supply chain flexibility affects the supply chain process and information sharing. © 2012-2018.},

abstract={Information sharing and coordination between the agents of a supply chain are considered to be an effective strategy for improving its global performance. This paper presents an updated review of current literature examining the impacts of information sharing and collaboration strategies on supply chain dynamic performance, with particular focus on dyadic structure. To achieve this, a systematic review approach is followed over the period 2000-2012, intending to ensure that the process is reproducible and auditable. A comprehensive taxonomy is also presented, highlighting strategic and operational impacts of collaborative structures. The analysis revealed that collaborative and information sharing issues underlined 10 years ago still require further attention from researchers. © 2013 Universidad ICESI.

abstract={Effective data acquisition for business process monitoring has become a critical element in today's business world. While the need for monitoring is generally agreed upon by both re- searchers and practitioners alike, the means and mechanisms are often vague. This is especially salient with the fast growing availability of various technologies to monitor in real-time through recent advances such as the Internet of Things (IoT) with specific emphasis on Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) and associated sensor networks. This study is motivated by the lack of published literature in data acquisition and analytics that specifically addresses sufficient real-time data acquisition for effective managerial monitoring. As a step in addressing this void, we review and extend existing literature in this general area by studying various requirements and information sources that relate to effective management monitoring. We then design an exploratory study to evaluate current managerial monitoring needs and the importance of automated data collection technologies. Results from this study show that the most important latent factor that influences an organization's information need is its dynamic competitiveness, and consequently, companies with a dynamic supply chain would need a faster transaction and operations data system. The second important latent factor is the behavioral performance, which renders it essential to have a human-centric data system. This study provides evidence for the significance in adopting technologies such as RFID and other IoT systems for real-time monitoring in highly dynamic organizations and offers guidelines for analytical technology adoption for various industries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Food supply chains are increasingly complex and dynamic due to (i) increasing product proliferation to serve ever diversifying and globalising markets as a form of mass customisation with resulting global flows of raw materials, ingredients and products, and (ii) the need to satisfy changing and variable consumer and governmental demands with respect to food safety, animal welfare, and environmental impact. Transparency in the food supply chain is essential to guarantee food quality and provenance to all users of food and food products. Intensified information exchange and integrated information systems involving all chain actors are needed to achieve transparency with respect to a multitude of food properties. In this paper, specific challenges of food supply chains are highlighted. Major elements are addressed that support transparency to consumers, the government and food companies, which are considered the claimants of transparency. Elements considered to be enablers of transparency are governance mechanisms, quality and safety standards and information exchange. The paper specifies these transparency claimants and enablers for food supply chains and identifies major information system functions and information technology applications needed to comply with transparency demands. It thereby provides a framework for transparency analysis in food supply chains. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The production of iron and steel is one of the largest global sources of industrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. South Africa (SA) could competitively export near-zero embodied GHG primary iron to steelmakers in leading decarbonizing markets. A green primary iron production process substitutes hydrogen for coke as the iron ore reductant. A SA plant would enjoy most of its competitive cost advantage from hydrogen produced using very low-cost solar photovoltaic electricity. In import markets, using the European Union (EU) as an example, steelmakers could use imported green primary iron to increase utilization of electric arc furnaces while reducing total EU demand for clean electricity (i.e. for hydrogen for reduction needs) and thereby lower total system costs of decarbonization. SA could bolster crucial export and tax revenues while moving towards a broader transition to a sustainable industry. Three things are needed to unlock new global business models involving the relocating of green primary iron production to regions with abundant renewable energy: (1) a steelmaker with access to a hydrogen reduction technology appropriate for SA’s ores willing and able to invest in a plant; (2) access to a bankable lead market for that plant’s production; and (3) international trade rules and emissions accounting related to the carbon content of commodities that enable the reconfiguration of supply chains to reduce global decarbonization costs. Key policy insights Green primary iron production in SA could increase value added from local iron ore and solar energy resources, bolster exports and initiate transformation to a sustainable industry. Green primary iron imports from SA to the EU could reduce the cost of overall decarbonization while increasing the competitiveness of steel product manufacturing. Enabling conditions include a willing steelmaker, fair access to the EU iron market, enabling trade rules, and embodied emissions certification and accounting. Green primary iron imports can reduce demands on EU low carbon electricity supply, lowering electricity prices and increasing energy security. The collaboration envisioned between the EU and SA could help develop the framework for future inter-regional decarbonization strategies for other commodities and other countries. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={To maintain competitiveness, businesses need to upgrade their operational performance and financial performance more efficiently and effectively in order to control uncertainty and costs. The purposes of the study are to (1) investigate the relationship between three dimensions, namely integration, flexibility, and performance; and (2) examine the mediating effects of supply chain flexibility. This research collected annual reports from the Indonesian basic and chemical industry from 2014 to 2017. Content analysis was used to extract information from companies’ annual reports, and hierarchical analysis examined the hypotheses. The results show that external information integration positively influences both reactive and proactive flexibility. Furthermore, proactive flexibility significantly affects financial performance and operational performance. Moreover, both reactive and proactive flexibility have positive mediating effects on the connection between external information integration and operational performance. Lastly, reactive flexibility positively mediates external information integration’s effect on financial performance. As the market has been becoming more competitive, this study provides important insights for decision-makers. This study contributes to the knowledge of the Indonesian basic and chemical supply chain by considering both financial and operational performance, especially as these performance indexes measure different dimensions. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Previous studies are lacking with regard to sustainable supply chain capabilities; specifically, there are hierarchical structures and measures in qualitative information and quantitative data in nature. In addition, previous studies do not integrate social media with qualitative information and quantitative data, even though social media is an important reference for decision-making. Hence, this study applied the fuzzy synthetic evaluation and decision-making trial evaluation laboratory to address linguistic preferences and provide a strategic approach for the proposed attributes. The results present the integration of qualitative information and quantitative data for building a hierarchical structure with sustainable supply chain capabilities and indicate that social, dynamic and information capabilities are simultaneously strongly affected. The top seven criteria that most influence sustainable supply chain capabilities are outbound logistics flexibility, supply chain reconceptualization, information quality, coevolution, market-oriented perception, partner development and knowledge acquisition and absorptive capacity.

abstract={Despite years of extensive research conducted on information technology (IT) adaption onto supply chain, evolving technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud Computing in developing countries lack proper implementation. According to the Deloitte digital (2021) report, 87% of companies think technology will disrupt their industry, and only 44% are potential prepared for digital disruption. Thus, it is crucial to identify the areas in which IT may affect supply chain management (SCM) to formulate a clear strategy and implement IT in the supply chain. This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework that examines the impact of IT on SCM in the pharmaceutical industry. The conceptual framework depicted in the article is obtained from the gap analysis of theoretical studies within the pharmaceutical industry. The study is based on desktop research and critical analysis of available literature obtained from secondary sources, including journals, conference papers, books, private and public reports, and online sources. The findings from this paper provide a starting point for scholars and practitioners to examine the impact of IT on SCM further. The framework can be used as a guiding tool for future researchers when determining a model for adaption. For practitioners, the framework can be used to gain insight into the contributing factors of IT and its practical uses within SC. Copyright © 2021 by Naudé Scribante.

The Nash equilibrium point and its stable region are obtained, and the occurrence of bifurcation is studied by parsing and through a numerical simulation. The influence of the price adjustment parameters, coefficient of services, and other parameters are investigated on a nonlinear dynamic game model. Such dynamic behaviors as bifurcation, periodic cycles, strange attractors of the system, phase portrait and sensitive dependence on initial conditions are studied.

abstract={Solar Photovoltaic (PV) system is considered as one of the most important renewable energy sources as global community pledging to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG). However, there is environment cost for producing PV systems, including all carbon emissions generated from all phases of manufacturing supply chain. Thus, energy payback time (EPBT) has become important criteria to evaluate the performance PV systems. Estimating EPBT of PV systems relies on life cycle analysis (LCA) assessment. Current carbon footprint (CF) calculation uses long-run CF averaging method, which generates static CF information. However, solar PV Supply chain is quite dynamic because PV system components may be manufactured in different regions and use different power sources. Thus, the averaging method is not able to capture the dynamics of CF and that also implies that the uncertainties and data quality of CF auditing are negatively impacted. This study proposes an IoT-based dynamic carbon footprint approach to address the challenges above. The proposed method aims to capture LCA measuring data from IoT sensors and calculate dynamic CF of PV module across PV supply chain. The dynamic CF allows each PV module to have unique CF pedigree information based on its source of parts, the mix of energy types used during the manufacturing stage, and other CF related allocation data. The dynamic CF information can greatly reduce the information asymmetry between data providers and CF auditors, thus lowering the uncertainties and improving the data quality of CF auditing. A case study of a solar PV supply chain is presented in this paper, and the proposed approach is evaluated against the current practice. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, the variety in the product mix, unpredictable customer demand and the need for a high level of service are crucial challenges in the management of a supply chain. Flexible processes are needed to gain competitive advantage and economic edges. This paper presents a data-driven application of unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms to a real-world case study in the automotive industry. The clustering input dataset collects the data available to a third-party logistics (3PL) provider. Clustering algorithms are used to define product families for the assignment of the workload to the processing resources. Several clustering algorithms (k-means, Gaussian mixture models and hierarchical clustering) define different product families scenarios using different tuning parameters. The impact of each clustering scenario on the operations is assessed via a dashboard of logistics KPIs to identify the best performing clustering algorithm. The performance of each clustering is, then, compared to a logistic benchmark given by a capacitated clustering to identify the best compromise between a logistic-constrained algorithm with a long runtime and fast data-driven uncapacitated algorithm. © 2020 The Authors.

The authors use the lens of ambidexterity (the ability both to exploit and explore) to analyse responses to complexity, since this enables the authors to understand the application of known solutions in conjunction with innovative ones to resolve difficulties. This research also seeks to investigate how managers respond to supply chain complexities that can either be operationally deleterious or strategically beneficial. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a descriptive framework based on the project management (PM) literature to understand response options to complexity, and then use interviews with supply chain managers in six organisations to examine the utility of this framework in practice. The authors ask the research question “How do managers in supply chains respond to complexities”? Findings: The case study data show first that managers faced with structural, socio-political, or emergent supply chain complexities use a wide range of responses. Second, over a third of the instances of complexity coded were actually accommodated, rather than reduced, by the study firms, suggesting that adapting to supply chain complexity in certain instances may be strategically appropriate. Third, the lens of ambidexterity allows a more explicit assessment of whether existing PM solutions can be considered or if novel methods are required to address supply chain complexities. Practical implications: The descriptive framework can aid managers in conceptualising and addressing supply chain complexity. Through exploiting current knowledge, managers can lessen the impact of complexity while exploring other innovative approaches to solve new problems and challenges that evolve from complexity growth driven by business strategy. Originality/value: This study addresses a gap in the literature through the development of a framework which provides a structure on ways to address supply chain complexity. The authors evaluate an existing project complexity concept and demonstrate that it is both applicable and valuable in non-project, ongoing operations. The authors then extend it using the lens of ambidexterity, and develop a framework that can support practitioners in analysing and addressing both strategically necessary supply complexities, together with unwanted, negative complexities within the organisation and across the supply chain. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In the competitive world of today, each organization has a desire to sustain in the marketplace with the implementation of their healthier and flexible supply chain performance measurement (SCPM) system. For the successful implementation, needs to know the significant set of enablers. This study identifies a set of important enablers based on literature review and discussion with field experts of automobile manufacturing industries located in the National Capital Region of India. The vagueness and impreciseness of field expert’s judgements has been reduced using fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (fuzzy DEMATEL) approach and analyzed the enablers in order to implement a flexible SCPM system. The findings of this research advocate that enabler ‘higher customer satisfaction’ comes in picture with highest value of ‘Prominence’ (6.4272) and ‘Relation’ (1.0354), therefore seems as a most significant and influencing enabler, while on other side the enabler ‘proper capacity utilization’ is considered as ample influencing enabler, because it has lowest Prominence’ (4.4735) and ‘Relation’ (minus 0.9680) values. This research discussed the categorization into the cause and effect group, degree of interaction and inter-relationship of considered enablers. The outcomes of this study may provide an aid to the managers to implement an effective and flexible SCPM system through which overall profitability of an organization may be improved. © 2014, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.},

abstract={The feasibility of Small Modular Reactors (SMR) in providing a lower-cost power-generation alternative to large nuclear power plants has been suggested widely in recent years, but remains a largely undeveloped technology. Published reports have identified many of the challenges of building SMR technology, with the major ones being industrial capacity, local manufacturing, forging capability, competitiveness in global market, and supply chain management. This paper focuses on the adaption of supply chain management concepts and practices of nuclear power companies, in particular Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, which supports the nucleation of an SMR economy in the state of Missouri. The SCOR framework is used to define supply chain processes and partnerships in Missouri that will be essential in the establishment of SMR operations. The framework builds on findings from a review of open literature including modular specifications, economic reports, and supplier information for the state of Missouri and the U.S. This study investigates several key factors that influence the supply chain process: strategic supplier partnership, achievement of efficiency gains, supplier qualification/supplier development, and sustainability. The findings are intended to provide an overview of existing supply chain management best practices through a case study designed to formulate the development of an SMR supply chain.

abstract={Purpose: The importance of supply network flexibility (SNF) in the development of mass customization capability (MCC) has been implied in the literature but seldom subjected to empirical investigation. To fill the gap and contribute to MC literature, this paper aims to examine the role of SNF in facilitating the development of MCC of organizations. Furthermore, it has been investigated whether the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) strengthens the above relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the supply chain literature and dynamic capability theory, the study proposes a research framework depicting the interconnectedness among the variables of interest. The proposed framework has been tested using structural equation modelling based on partial least squares by using the data collected from a questionnaire-based survey of a sample of Indian manufacturing organizations. Findings: The findings indicate that the dimensions of SNF, namely, sourcing flexibility and supplier flexibility, positively affect the MCC of the organizations and the strength of these relationships is further amplified by the implementation of ICTs. Practical implications: The study shows the managerial opportunities for the development of a flexible and competent supply network to facilitate the development or enhancement of MCC. Originality/value: This study contributes to scant literature by providing empirical evidence for the relationship between SNF and MCC. Further, this study enriches the understanding of the crucial role of ICT by exploring its moderating effect on the relationship between the variables of interest. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Applying the dynamic capabilities view of how businesses cope with changing environments, we develop a conceptual model that links product variety management strategies with supply chain responsiveness, and relates supply chain responsiveness to cost and customer service in high- and low-customization environments. We find that a product variety management strategy influences both supply chain cost and customer service performance only when mediated by internal and external responsiveness capabilities. In addition, a product variety management strategy has different impacts on performance depending on the level of product customization. Specifically, in a low-customization environment, both supply chain flexibility and agility acting as dynamic capabilities have a significant influence on cost efficiency while in a high-customization environment, these dynamic capabilities have a significant influence on customer service. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose - A trade-off exists between product variety and supply chain (SC) performance. To help mitigate the impact on SC of increased product variety, the purpose of this paper is to examine how variety management activities including variety management strategy (VMS), supplier partnerships and close customer relationships affect SC flexibility and agility at different levels of customisation. Design/methodology/approach - A survey-research methodology is employed using data from 363 manufacturing firms from the UK and South Korea. In particular, cluster analysis and structural equation modelling were used to evaluate the proposed model according to the level of customisation. Findings - The results suggest that internal variety management strategy and external SC integration have a positive influence on SC flexibility and agility. Customer relationships and variety management strategies influence SC flexibility more than partnerships with suppliers whereas variety management strategies and partnerships with suppliers influence SC agility more than customer relationships. In fact, for external integration in particular, customer relationships influence SC flexibility (i.e. reaction capability) rather than agility (i.e. reaction time) whereas partnerships with suppliers influence SC agility rather than flexibility. In a high-customisation context, close customer relationships are the most effective way to increase SC flexibility, whereas partnerships with suppliers are the most effective way to increase SC agility. In a low-customisation context, a VMS and customer relationships are the most effective way to increase both SC flexibility and agility. Originality/value - This paper suggests key varietymanagement activities to aid managers to better manage product variety ambitions in SC under varying customisation profiles through internal and external approaches. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={There is increasing interest in the use of socio-economic assessment (SEA) as a tool to support regulatory decision-making and to help businesses maintain their social licence to operate. However, its application in the extractive industries remains unclear. Minerals and metals move through a complex and dynamic global supply chain, which makes it difficult to 'assign' socio-economic impacts to any one location. Intermediate products (e.g. metals) generally comprise many different inputs - some of which may be used in very small quantities but, nevertheless, impart essential and/or valuable properties to the final product - making it challenging to assign values. The SEA process is made even more complex by the diverse range of downstream applications which these products have, the potential for future innovation and a lack of reliable socio-economic statistics for the sector. In 2013/14, Risk & Policy Analysts Ltd undertook the first global study on the socio-economic value for manganese (Mn). This paper describes the key obstacles identified while undertaking this research and outlines some of the steps that were taken to ensure a robust SEA. It highlights important lessons that should be taken forward when undertaking future SEAs in the extractive industries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={One of the central questions in supply chain design is how to properly invest in supply chain capabilities in order to be more responsive to supply chain disruptions. This new perspective in supply chain design requires an understanding of the relationships among costs, supply chain risk drivers, and investments in supply chain capabilities. In this paper, we develop a multi-objective stochastic model for supply chain design under uncertainty and time-dependency. Sources of risk are modeled as a set of scenarios, and the risk of the system is determined. The objective is to examine the trade-offs among investments in improving supply chain capabilities and reducing supply chain risks, and to minimize cost of supply chain disruptions. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, a heuristic algorithm based on a relaxation method is designed to determine an optimal or near-optimal solution. To examine the efficiency of the heuristic algorithm, a numerical example is provided. Our findings suggest that increasing supply chain capabilities can be viewed as a mitigation strategy that enables a firm to reduce the total expected cost of a supply chain subject to disruptions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic is a disruption that has adversely affected many supply chains (SCs) around the world and further proved the necessity of combination and interaction of resilience and sustainability. In This paper, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is developed for responsive, resilient and sustainable mixed open and closed-loop supply chain network design (SCND) problem. The uncertainty of the problem is handled with a hybrid robust-stochastic optimization approach. A Lagrangian relaxation (LR) method and a constructive heuristic (CH) algorithm are developed for overcoming problem complexity and solving large-scale instances. In order to assess the performance of the mathematical model and solution methods, some test instances are generated. The computations showed that the model and the solution methods are efficient and can obtain high-quality solutions in suitable CPU times. Other analyses and computations are done based on a real case study in the tire industry. The results demonstrate that resilient strategies are so effective and can improve economic, environmental and social dimensions substantially. Research findings suggest that the proposed model can be used as an efficient tool for designing sustainable and resilient SCs and the related decision-makings. Also, our findings prove that resilience is necessary for continued SC sustainability. It is concluded that using proposed resilience strategies simultaneously brings the best outcome for SC objectives. Based on the sensitivity analyses, the responsiveness level significantly affects SC objectives, and managers should consider the trade-off between responsiveness and their objectives. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

In addition, ports are part of dynamic global supply chains and part of a network with a foreland and a hinterland. This chapter deals with the hinterland transport chain of ports. Chapter 8 of this book made already clear that ports are increasingly faced with congestion and that hinterland accessibility is a key factor in competition among ports. In that chapter hinter-land accessibility or improving the efficiency of port-related transport chains was approached from an infrastructural perspective and the perspective of dynamic traffic management. This chapter approaches hinterland accessibility as an organisational issue. It will show the importance of analysing coordination between actors responsible for an efficient functioning port-related transport chain. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Harry Geerlings, Bart Kuipers and Rob Zuidwijk; individual chapters, the contributors.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand which controlling and enabling practices are used, how the numerous supplying partners are managed and how positive network effects are generated in online service triads (multi-sided platform – supplying partners – consumers). Design/methodology/approach: A single representative in-depth case study was conducted to refine theory on managing service triads. The main data source consists of field notes collected by one author, who held a temporary position within the organization. Additional data were collected from observations, internal documents, informal talks and 20 interviews. Findings: The authors found controlling and enabling organizational practices in four main categories on two levels as follows: managing network composition (system level), managing order fulfillment and returns (operations level), category management (both levels) and capability enhancement (both levels). Research limitations/implications: The authors show that both controlling and enabling practices are present in online service triads. This enables platform owners and supplying partners to share responsibilities for creating positive network effects, i.e. to increase scale, which increases value, which again attracts more suppliers and consumers, which creates more value, etc. Practical implications: The authors present a range of and controlling and enabling practices that describe how multi-sided platforms can manage numerous supplying partners in an online context. Originality/value: This study is the first to show that contractual and relational governance is insufficient in service triads in online settings with numerous supplying partners. Further, the authors provide empirical evidence that supply networks continuously adapt over time. © 2020, Robert van Kalsbeek, Manda Broekhuis and Kees Jan Roodbergen.},

abstract={Previous research describes supplier integration as a competitive resource that manufacturers use to create economic rents. Considering the mixed results obtained from linking supplier integration with performance outcomes, a 'dynamic' component - or the ability to reconfigure the supply chain to adapt to changing environments - appears critical to creating a sustainable competitive advantage. This study identifies integration sensing, seizing and transforming as sub-capabilities that together form a dynamic capability, referred to herein as supplier integrative capability (SIC). That is, SIC enables buyers to sense changes in the supply environment by sharing information with suppliers, seize opportunities presented by establishing procedures to analyse this information and make long-term changes to existing processes. A global sample from the industrial sector reveals that the three capabilities exhibit complementarity and must exist simultaneously for the capability to be effective, which then enhances both process flexibility and cost efficiency and helps firms avoid the traditional trade-off of cost and flexibility. In addition, market and technological dynamics strengthen the effect of SIC on operational performance; supply base complexity attenuates this link. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It is an NP-hard problem and researchers are constantly attempting to use meta-heuristics as a solution approach. In this paper, a Multi-Objective Discrete Particle Swarm Algorithm (MODPSA) is proposed to optimise the supply chain network with the objectives of minimisation of supply chain cost, minimisation of demand fulfilment lead time and maximisation of volume flexibility. Two different global guide selection techniques are implemented in the proposed algorithm. Numerical tests are conducted using the real-life data of a farm equipment manufacturer and the computational analyses are performed on two stages. In the first stage, the performance of two global guide selection techniques are evaluated and in the second stage the proposed MODPSA is compared with Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA II). The results indicate that the proposed approach is effective in producing high-quality Pareto-optimal solutions. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to solve a multi-period supplier selection and inventory lot-sizing problem with multiple products in a serial supply chain. Compared to previous models proposed in the literature, our research incorporates a richer cost structure involving joint replenishment costs for raw material replenishment and production, and a more realistic description of the transportation costs represented as a vector of full-truck load costs for different size trucks. This problem can be displayed graphically as a time-expanded transshipment network defined by nodes and arcs that can be reached by feasible material flows. First, we propose an integrated mixed integer linear programming model that minimizes the cost over the entire supply chain for a given planning horizon. The model determines the optimal dynamic supplier selection, inventory lot-sizing, and production schedule simultaneously. Second, a sequential approach is proposed to solve the same problem. That is, a production schedule is determined first, and then a supplier selection and replenishment strategy is obtained according to that predetermined schedule. Sensitivity analysis comparing the two approaches is performed. Results show that, even though the integrated approach achieves the minimum cost, the sequential approach may be suitable for solving large-scale instances of the problem as it requires less information sharing and generates a near-optimal solution with shorter implementation time and computational effort. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The operationalization of the multimodal International North–South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is an important strategic part of it. This “pivot to the South” by Russia and other Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries is of particular significance in light of the required reconfiguration of supply chains in Eurasia. Russian exporters, importers and freight forwarding companies’ needs in alternative logistical opportunities have increased dramatically. The INSTC development would promote Eurasian intra- and transcontinental connectivity, reduce export costs, develop new production niches, and realize the Caspian region’s transit potential. This study estimates that the aggregate potential INSTC freight traffic via all the routes and modes of transport, including containerized and non-containerized cargoes, will reach 15–25 million tonnes by 2030. The container traffic could rise 20x and this will require investments in hard infrastructure and also soft infrastructure improvement.

abstract={Enhancing the proactive strategic capabilities to withstand the most unfavourable circumstances is always appreciated as a long-term policy rather than incident-based responses. The present research is positioned on this fundamental notion of supply chain risk management with a particular focus on strategic capabilities like reliability and flexibility that often conflict with cost. Accordingly, the authors propose a multi-objective mathematical model for designing a four-echelon supply chain that optimises cost, reliability, and volume flexibility. Interestingly, this research is the maiden effort to optimise the supply chain with these trifold objectives and herein lies the novelty as well as the challenges. Consequently, a genetic algorithm based approach is utilised as the solution methodology. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the small problem instances and the four-echelon problems have also been validated through exact methods and simulated annealing algorithm, respectively. A case study on a footwear supply chain involving three echelons is also presented to showcase the industrial applicability and adaptability of the proposed model. A fuzzy TOPSIS method has been adopted in the case study to incorporate the expert opinion for assigning priorities to the objectives. Supply chain professionals can leverage this methodology to establish a risk resistant supply chain. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: Medical technology (MedTech) is a growth industry, which like other manufacturing sectors has undergone fragmentation of production and emergence of Global Value Chains (GVCs). The purpose of this paper is to compare how two open European economies position themselves competitively within MedTech GVCs: highly developed Switzerland and the emerging Czech Republic. Design/methodology/approach: The research applies a mixed methodology to analyze the performance of each location in the MedTech GVCs. It draws on macroeconomic, industry, trade and a proprietary sample of firm data, combined with onsite interviews. Findings: The economic outcomes and GVC positions differ in both cases, whereas Switzerland focuses on high value-added activities such as R&D and after-sales service. Specialized manufacturing is also located here in spite of high costs. By contrast, the Czech Republic focuses mostly on low value-added activities, like manufacturing disposables, although some domestic innovative companies are notable. The authors generalize four types of firms in the industry, comparing their presence in both locations. Practical implications: The competitive positions and challenges faced by each location when engaging in MedTech GVCs are summarized and related to economic outcomes. In the Czech Republic, the barriers to upgrading include its business environment, and weak links between education institutions and industry. Switzerland’s high cost structure is offset by adding high value in core competencies. Both countries should protect the inherent advantage their locations offer within responsive European supply chains. Originality/value: GVC research in the MedTech sector has been limited. There is no comparison of two European countries, and their position in MedTech GVCs, nor of how firms, participate successfully in them. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The sustainable synthesis of a company's network is performed regarding the integration of renewables such as biomass and other wastes, and solar energy. The obtained solutions are those reflecting maximal profit, reflecting constantly-changing dynamic market conditions, accounting for several uncertain parameters, and protecting the environment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Today’s complexity of distributed application systems, such as dynamic supply networks, requires a system-of-systems (SoS) perspective for effective adaptation and sustainable use. Those systems not only need to be operated as separate systems (e.g., optimizing each transport modality in supply networks), but also are required to capture complex situations as interconnected entity (e.g., adapting a transport chain involving different modalities according to weather conditions). SoS can handle such challenges through emerging behavior, while letting each of the involved systems operate separately. The latter property requires interoperability of systems that can be preserved even in dynamically changing environments applying the theory of bigraphs. Abstract relationships allow not only the representation of dynamic interaction but also the respecification of these systems through behavior adaptations. This abstraction supports cross-system decomposition as well as composition of interaction patterns for the purpose of emergent behavior. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by orchestrating two distributed and independent systems. SoS behavior orchestration enables to directly respond to changes in the application system context. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract={Engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business in Europa is increasingly under pressure. Lack of productivity, low or negative profit margins for investors, and the lack of adopting necessary innovations and digitalization—from engineering activities through operations and maintenance to decommissioning—have caused significant deprivation of business and competitiveness compared to emerging providers in Asia. The quest for reducing capital expenditures (CAPEX) in EPC projects is intensifying. In May 2018, a research project was started to analyze the situation and key trends through desk research, to research how the challenges of the business could be tackled and to derive practical guidance for EPC contractors as well as for investors, owners, and operators (O/O). The project aimed to propose innovative ways of improving the EPC business model to reach the next level (“EPC 4.0”). In doing so, lessons learned from the automotive and aviation industry were considered. A key objective of the research project was to challenge statements of international EPC experts to cut CAPEX by 40–50% in EPC projects. With this statement in mind, the research focused on identifying measures with potential in six areas: (1) digitalization, (2) partnering, (3) flat supply chains, (4) flexible organizations, (5) core competences, and (6) the human factor. Summarizing the findings in these areas, the EPC 4.0 project came to a savings potential of up to 50% of the total budgeted project costs. © 2020 Wagner, published by Sciendo.},

Our study which is grounded in information processing theory argues that two mechanisms can support firms in building up sourcing flexibility. Based on a survey of 336 manufacturing firms from Europe and the U.S. and using partial least squares (PLS) modeling as well as hierarchical regression analysis, we show that supplier evaluation and selection, and the integration of information systems at the buyer-supplier interface are positively related to sourcing flexibility. Sourcing flexibility, in turn, is curvilinearly related to delivery performance. Finally, delivery performance positively influences the product's financial performance. The strong associations between sourcing flexibility, delivery performance, and product financial performance underscore that sourcing flexibility merits the attention of supply chain managers during supplier selection and purchasing decisions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The approach of fossil fuel substitution requires alternative strategies in the progressing sector coupling of energy storage, distribution and conversion. Promising solutions are flexibly supply chain models of green and blue hydrogen which is fed into the natural gas network (HNG). Prerequisite for a successful implementation is the functional capability of end-use applications for which different volumetric hydrogen thresholds are documented in literature. A clear research gap is thereby evident for HNG fired medium-speed large-bore gas engines typical used for stationary power generation. For solving this problem, generic single cylinder tests with focus on operating window, NOx formation and hydro-carbon emissions have been carried out. The results are analysed and compared to available publications of HNG fired high-speed gas engines to derive general insights of the combustion characteristics. Under rising blending share, an in literature described, general shifting of the possible operating window and an increase of NOx formation are detected. In terms of unburned hydrocarbons, a NOx-neutral reduction potential through hydrogen blending is only visible under very lean operating conditions. This result deviates from expected literature values of high-speed engine setups. The experimental study demonstrates the NOx neutral combustion capability of medium-speed large-bore gas engines under 20% hydrogen admixture. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

abstract={The importance of big data analytics–enabled dynamic capability has been at the forefront of research for information systems management, operations management, and strategic management community. Prior studies have reported on the influence of big data analytics–enabled dynamic capability (BDA) for improved organizational agility and organizational performance, but there has been a paucity of literature regarding the role of big data analytics–enabled dynamic capability in untangling the supply chain ambidexterity dilemma and organizational performance. To address these research gaps, this paper draws on the dynamic capability view of the organization under the contingent effect of environmental dynamism. We tested our research hypotheses using 281 surveys, gathered using a pre-tested questionnaire. Our results suggest that BDA has positive effects on improving supply chain agility (SCAG), supply chain adaptability (SCAD) and performance measures (cost performance and operational performance). However, we noted that hypotheses regarding the moderating effect of environmental dynamism (ED) on the paths joining BDA and SCAG/SCAD were not supported. To address these unexpected results, we conducted post hoc analysis to explain the rationale behind the insignificant moderating effects of ED on the paths joining BDA and SCAG/SCAD. We found that the effects of BDA on SCAG/SCAD were higher under intermediate levels of environmental dynamism but comparatively weak when the environmental dynamism is low or high. Hence, we can argue that big data analytics can help enhance supply chain agility, supply chain adaptability, and organizational performance, but these effects are contingent upon the level of environmental dynamism. Moreover, a non-linear, inverse U-shaped moderating effect of environmental dynamism exists. Collectively, these findings provide a theory-based understanding of the organizational level of usage of big data analytics and its effects on supply chain agility, supply chain adaptability, and organizational performance. Moreover, they further shape our understanding of how big data analytics–enabled dynamic capabilities yield differential results under the moderating effect of environmental dynamism. Hence, we believe that our results will be useful for managers who are highly optimistic about the usage of these emerging technologies and their effects on supply chain characteristics. Finally, we have outlined our study limitations and offered numerous research directions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Considering market randomness and accumulation of production experience, a Stackelberg differential game model is constructed. In the game, the manufacturer is the leader and its pricing and emission reduction strategies over time are deduced in farsighted and myopic behaviors, respectively. In both behaviors, the emission reduction increases over time and a relatively low/high carbon price leads to skimming/penetrating pricing strategy of the manufacturer. Numerical study shows that the manufacturer must adopt a farsighted behavior for profit seeking except that consumers' low-carbon awareness is quite low, and the retailer also prefers the manufacturer to adopt this behavior. Increasing carbon price and consumers' low-carbon awareness benefits the manufacturer rather than the retailer. The governments can take measures to raise the carbon price to reduce the environmental impact. © 2022 Shihao Wan et al.},

abstract={Carbon neutrality and resilience are two of important goals pursued by supply chains today. This study seeks to determine how carbon footprint reduction (CFR) can be achieved in a resilient supply chain from a process integration perspective. Based on contingency theory, we employed the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach to examine the critical influencing factors of process integration using evaluations from academic and professional experts. Our findings reveal that, first, at the strategic level, supply chain collaboration (SCC) and supply chain agility and responsiveness (SCAR) have the highest contributions to process integration. Second, process and control risks have the highest contributions in supply chain risk management; herein, collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR) holds the highest contribution in the SCC, visibility and velocity have the highest contributions in the SCAR, and supply chain efficiency holds the highest contribution in supply chain flexibility (SCF). Finally, CPFR has a significant influence on both supplier and customer engagement, with supply chain intelligence influencing customer engagement in the SCC. Both the standardisation and parallel processes influence supplier spending in the SCF. These findings provide a new conceptual framework for empirical research and an action plan for supply chains to pursue carbon neutrality. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The increasing carbon emissions cause severe environmental issues that threaten the survival of human beings. Such a situation promotes supply chain firms and governments to take various measures to achieve the sustainable goal. This paper investigates the cost-sharing cooperation strategy of emission reductions in a dynamic supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and two distinct retailers with different scales. In the presence of carbon tax and green reputation, we model a Stackelberg differential game to derive and compare the optimal equilibrium decisions and further conduct a numerical study to analyze the chain members’ profits between the cases of no cost sharing and cost sharing. The manufacturer can actualize this sharing, respectively, with either of the competitive retailers. The results show that cost sharing is a better choice for supply chain members than no sharing. In the cost-sharing scenario, the manufacturer and two retailers prefer the case in which the emission reduction cost that a retailer undertakes is relatively high, because the manufacturer can increase emission reduction level to build its green reputation, and thereby the retailers can improve profits. When the proportion of emission reduction cost that a retailer undertakes locates in a certain interval, all the supply chain participants can be better off in the scenario where small-scale retailer shares the emission reduction cost. In addition, the increase in carbon tax improves the flexibility of cost-sharing ratio for the members achieving this consensual scenario on the cost-sharing cooperation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={The increased carbon emissions cause relatively climate deterioration and attract more attention of governments, consumers, and enterprises to the low-carbon manufacturing. This paper considers a dynamic supply chain, which is composed of a manufacturer and a retailer, in the presence of the cap-and-trade regulation and the consumers' reference emission effects. To investigate the manufacturer's behavior choice and its impacts on the emission reduction and pricing strategies together with the profits of both the channel members, we develop a Stackelberg differential game model in which the manufacturer acts in both myopic and farsighted manners. By comparing the equilibrium strategies, it can be found that the farsighted manufacturer always prefers to keep a lower level of emission reduction. When the emission permit price is relatively high, the wholesale/retail price is lower if the manufacturer is myopic and hence benefits consumers. In addition, there exists a dilemma that the manufacturer is willing to act in a farsighted manner but the retailer looks forward to a partnership with the myopic manufacturer. For a relatively high price of emission permit, adopting myopic strategies results in a better performance of the whole supply chain. © 2019 Jun Wang et al.},

abstract={When some agents in the supply chain are failure, the whole supply chain may be influenced. This paper presents a framework for identifying vulnerable agents in supply chain network. The framework consists of three main components: supply chain dynamic network, risk transmission model, and identifying vulnerable nodes. The supply chain dynamic network component consists of constructing the supply chain dynamic network according to the topology structure. The risk transmission model component researches on the risk transmission mechanism among nodes, and constructs a concept model which takes both influence degree between two agents, and the contribution rate of each edge into account to measure the vulnerability of each node, the last component uses the fuzzy theory to calculate the vulnerability of each node based on the dynamic network. Such a solving strategy can get the vulnerability, which fits better to the real condition, some numerical experiments are also performed to validate the effectiveness of proposed models. © 2017 IEEE.},

Modularized supply chain management is a new form of supply chain governance mechanism. The construction of modularized supply chain is the process of deconstructing industrial value network, which forms a network structure of strong connection within the module and weak connection between modules. The results reveal that modularized supply chain management is positively related to channel flexibility. Supplier management capability enhances channel flexibility through modularized supply chain management. Meanwhile, industrial digitization has a positive moderating effect on the above relationship.

abstract={The modern supply chain network has geographically spread out across the globe. The performance of a customer service level is highly dependent on the effectiveness of its supply chain planning. To improve the service provided to downstream customers, planners must not only decide order allocation among multiple distribution centres but also consider reducing the order-to-delivery time. Directed shipment delivery from manufacturing sites provides the flexibility of direct shipment; however, it also makes order allocation more difficult. In this study, a flexible supply network planning (FSNP) model based on integer linear programming is developed for the memory module industry. In addition to multisite order allocation planning, the FSNP model explicitly considers directed shipment from manufacturing sites for reducing the order-to-delivery time. Furthermore, the combination of characteristics of the memory module industry, such as multilevel and multisite production environments, multiple-to-multiple product structures, transportation and production lead times and capacity constraints, makes FSNP highly complicated. The results of the experiments reveal that the FSNP model improves supply chain planning regarding order due date and inventory and transportation costs. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Low-carbon production is key to both economic and environmental sustainability. It is, however, inadequate to meet the low-carbon targets by the manufacturing industry alone. Current research on emission reduction targets mainly at individual optimality, with little consideration of the synergistic benefits achievable through coordination among supply chain players. This paper fills this gap by incorporating Pareto improvement to ensure that all members are likely to gain in emission reduction through coordination. It gives the emission-dependent manufacturers theoretical basis and managerial insights to go through the stringent emission-limited market, especially under a new proposed low-carbon policy of flexible cap-and-trade, which will soon be deployed for emissions trading in China. This flexible cap-and-trade policy aligns emission reduction with capacity adjustments, but its impact has rarely been investigated. Considering the complexity of the supply chain structure, this paper simplifies the problem to two stages: manufacturer and retailer. While the demand uncertainty is considered with Newsvendor models, Stackelberg game is exploited to solve this problem with three contracts, namely revenue sharing, cost sharing, and two-part tariff. Analytical and numerical studies show that the profitability and greenness of the supply chain are increased by coordination with revenue sharing and two-part tariff contracts. The Pareto improvement encourages cooperation between the supply chain members. Managerial insights are given to help emission-dependent manufacturers compete in the increasingly stringent low-carbon environment. The novelty of this paper lies in the investigation of synergistic benefits achievable through coordination under the new flexible cap-and-trade emission policy, and the Pareto-improving conditions with several contracts are analyzed by Newsvendor models. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Due to increasing environmental pollution, governments have issued a series of policies to control carbon emissions. A carbon quota policy is one of them. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of the policy by examining its impact on supply chain members. This paper investigates emissions reduction in a supply chain under different carbon emission quotas in two stages. This paper constructs a supply chain model in three modes: (i) no carbon emission quota policy, (ii) the government implements the first stage of a carbon quota policy, and (iii) the government offers lower carbon quotas in the second stage. The analysis reveals that when the initial carbon quota allocated by the government meets certain conditions, the emission reduction rate in the first stage of the carbon quota policy is greater than that without the carbon quota policy; and an interesting finding is that the reduction rate further increases when the government reduces carbon quotas in the second stage. In addition to the reduction rate, the manufacturer's and the retailer's profits increase with consumers' preference for low-carbon products. With an increase of the decline parameter of free allocated carbon emission rights, the profits of both the manufacturer and the retailer decrease, but the profit of the manufacturer in the second stage is always lower than that in the first stage, whereas the retailer's profit is higher in the second stage than in the first stage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We study a two-period supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, who participates in a cap-and-trade scheme and faces an uncertain emission permit price, and a retailer, who sells the product from the manufacturer to consumer and faces a price-sensitive demand. In the face of uncertain future permit prices, the manufacturer determines the wholesale price and pollution abatement in each period that reduces pollutants per unit of output one period later. We model the problem as a two-period Stackelberg game, obtain a feedback Stackelberg equilibrium, and investigate the effects of emissions trading on the manufacturer's abatement investment, supply chain performance, and social welfare. We obtain a revenue-and-cost-sharing contract that coordinates the dynamic stochastic supply chain. We show that the abatement level increases in the permit price and decreases in its uncertainty. Moreover, the dirtier the supply chain is, the less is the effect of permit price and the more is the effect of its uncertainty. Both the manufacturer and the channel may benefit from the permit price uncertainty. For a dirty supply chain, a lower price and higher uncertainty intensify the double marginalization effect. If the second-period sales revenue is low enough, the manufacturer benefits and the retailer loses under the coordinating contract. Finally, when the toxicity of pollutants is relatively low (high), the effect of emissions trading on social welfare might be stronger in a cleaner (dirtier) supply chain. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper aims to understand the underlying mechanisms by which relational ties influence firm innovation. Companies in China rely much on relational ties to implement business strategies. Combining social network theory with dynamic capability perspective, we build a model that analyzes the direct and indirect impact of relational ties (business ties and service ties) on innovation performance through supply chain adaptability. We further analyze that technological turbulence and dysfunctional competition influence the relationships between relational ties and supply chain adaptability. We test these relationships using data collected from 300 manufacturers in China. The results show that service ties plays a relatively more important role than business ties in enhancing innovation performance directly. Interactions between business ties and service ties significantly influence innovation performance. Moreover, our results demonstrate that supply chain adaptability fully mediates the relationship between business ties and innovation performance but partially mediates the relationship between service ties and innovation performance. Our results show that technological turbulence positively moderates the relationships between business/service ties and supply chain adaptability. In addition, dysfunctional competition negatively moderates the relationship between business ties and supply chain adaptability. Overall, our findings contribute to the understanding of the roles of relational ties in supply chain. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to highly competitive market environment, the supply chain network of business organization are not only efficient but also flexible. The flexible supply chain of business organization is greatly influenced by the suppliers. Hence, the selection of suppliers has to be flexible which not only take into account the quantitative factors but also take into account qualitative factors. In this paper, a novel attempt is conceptualized to model a flexible supplier selection (FSS) problem by integrating the qualitative and quantitative models for supplier selection problem. A MINLP, a quantitative model, is considered in the proposed FSS framework where factors such as lead time, quality, supplier's capacity and transportation cost are considered. Similarly, in qualitative model factors such as loyalty, technology adaptability, CSR and environmental factors are considered. AHP and IRP, qualitative models, have been applied and compared for supplier's ranking. An integrated ranking of AHP and IRP is used for modeling FSS problem. Finally, Integration of quantitative and qualitative model provides the set of deviation which measure the level of flexibility from pure solution of supplier selection problem by quantitative and qualitative model. The methodology of FSS problem is presented and demonstrated through an illustrative example of multi-product, multi-source and multi-period case. © 2014 Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.},

abstract={The rapid development of technology influences the changing culture of various aspects of the organization. This results in a paradigm shift in many areas of the organization, including in higher education. Changes have taken place in the implementation of the core and support processes in the universities. Cultural changes occur in the teaching and learning processes as well as in the administration of higher education. Universities are required to respond and be flexible to change, which needs planning and management. Unplanned and unproperly managed changes may cause a decrease in efficiency and productivity, especially in higher education. Discussion of flexibility generally relates to manufacturing companies. This paper aimed to identify factors of IT management flexibility needs in higher education by adopting supply chain flexibility concept. Supply chain flexibility is oriented at improving the quality of distributing and ordering goods while the IT management flexibility concept is oriented at improving the quality of service at universities. The research phase includes: identifying needs, envisioning, and planning solutions.

abstract={The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between IT integration, sourcing flexibility, logistics flexibility and supply chain agility. The study focused on ARV distribution from Joint Medical Stores to its health units in central Uganda. A cross sectional and quantitative research design was used. Primary data was collected from 80 Health units using self-structured questionnaires. Data was analyzed using SPSS where; a Content Validity Index was ran to assess the validity of each construct and the reliability of the variables was assessed using Cronbach alpha at a cut off level of 0.7. Pearson's rank correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength of the relationship between variables and a Regression analysis to determine the extent to which the independent variables could predict a change in the dependent variable. The findings indicated a positive and significant relationship between the constructs of IT integration, sourcing flexibility, logistics flexibility and supply chain agility. From this study, it is recommendable that in order to improve the supply chain's agility, other factors like; donor demands, political stability, the stigma associated with AIDS among others, should be given attention. The study contributes to the existing literature by empirically investigating the main reasons for Joint Medical stores needing to increase the agility of its supply chain so as to meet its customer requirement on a timely basis. © 2013 International Business Information Management Association.},

abstract={Serpula lacrymans, the causative agent of dry rot timber decay in buildings, is a Basidiomycete fungus in the Boletales clade. It owes its destructiveness to a uniquely well-developed capacity to colonize by rapid mycelial spread from sites of initial spore infection, coupled with aggressive degradation of wood cellulose. Genomic methods have recently elucidated the evolution and enzymic repertoire of the fungus, suggesting that it has a distinctive mode of brown rot wood decay. Using novel methods to image nutrient translocation, its mycelium has been modeled as a highly responsive resource-supply network. Dry rot is preventable by keeping timber dry. However, in established outbreaks, further mycelial spread can be arrested by inhibitors of translocation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Talent management is one of the most discussed areas of human resource management in 21st century. This is due to its vast range of implications in almost all processes of organization. However, introduction of HR 4.0 has diverted all the attention towards this new concept as talent management evolved in a more predicting role afterwards. This study has aimed to analyze the impact of talent management practices such as on-boarding, off-boarding and development on supply chain flexibility in mediating role of strategic HR 4.0 adoption. Responses were collected from the managerial employees of manufacturing sector of Thailand and those firms were selected for survey who were either adopted or in process of adoption of strategic HR 4.0. The gathered data was then tested statistically on SPSS and AMOS especially through confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Results have revealed that talent management practices have significant impact on supply chain flexibility in manufacturing firms. Moreover, findings have also flagged strategic HR 4.0 adoption as a positive significant mediator in relationship between talent management practices and supply chain flexibility. Implications of this study has also extended towards telecommunication and service sectors too because most of such sectors are undergoing from strategic HR 4.0 adoption. © 2019 ExcelingTech Pub.},

This trend is expected to continue as companies strive to be more competitive on a global scale. Service-oriented firms are not the only ones to benefit from supply chain flexibility strategies. Apple and Dell are both wildly successful and are considered highly flexible firms. One general complaint from all virtual workers is connectivity issues. This is inherent with the position. Locations in third world countries are more susceptible to online issues. If a constant source of electricity or internet availability is an issue, it goes without saying that workers’ productivity will be affected. So far, this potential downfall has not proven a major problem for companies. Will other companies follow the leader and begin using more remote access positions within their firms? If they value the knowledge from benchmarking, then yes. Rather they should, as long as they possess the needed resources. Practical implications: The paper provides strategic insights and practical thinking that have influenced some of the world’s leading organizations.

abstract={Companies manufacturing customized engineer-to-order (ETO) products are decelerated by repetitive work, misinterpretations and uncoordinated processes which prohibits the achievement of mass customization. Being able to deliver customized product with low costs and fast delivery times, the concept of mass customization, is a prerequisite for maintained competitiveness with the demands from the market today. This paper presents a product configuration system (PCS) for customized products using design automation enabled by knowledge-based engineering (KBE) and enterprise-wide optimization (EWO). With this approach, the process from sales to delivery of customized products can be extensively rationalized. The PCS consists of two modules. The first being a configurator for use in the sales quotation stage. Here, customer requirements are captured, and used to generate alternatives feasible for the customer context. Thereby, correct quotations can be generated at the sales instance. The second module is the enterprise-wide configurator where accepted orders are concurrently optimized for their detailed and final design, considering the current state of the production and concurrent sales cases in the company. In other terms, instead of adapting the supply chain according to the design of the products in the order entry, the design of the products in the order entry are adapted according to the state of the supply chain. Thereby, resources can be efficiently utilized to the benefit of both the customer and the company, with reduced costs and delivery times. An implementation of the PCS in a case concerning spiral staircases, an ETO product, has shown potential of substantially reducing resources and errors and enable a reliable process supporting achievement of mass customization. © 2021 by ASME},

abstract={Modern chemical processes need to operate around time-varying operating conditions to optimize plant economy, in response to dynamic supply chains (e.g., time-varying specifications of product and energy costs). As such, the process control system needs to handle a wide range of operating conditions whilst optimizing system performance and ensuring stability during transitions. This article presents a reference-flexible nonlinear model predictive control approach using contraction based constraints. Firstly, a contraction condition that ensures convergence to any feasible state trajectories or setpoints is constructed. This condition is then imposed as a constraint on the optimization problem for model predictive control with a general (typically economic) cost function, utilizing Riemannian weighted graphs and shortest path techniques. The result is a reference flexible and fast optimal controller that can trade-off between the rate of target trajectory convergence and economic benefit (away from the desired process objective). The proposed approach is illustrated by a simulation study on a CSTR control problem. © 2022 The Authors.

This article aims to study the Hainan port logistics supply chain and its flexible operation mechanism of digital visualization remote control and hopes that through the blessing of remote control technology, the port's ability to deal with the external environment will be improved. Based on the theory of logistics service availability of supply line flexibility, this paper constructs the evaluation of Hainan port logistics service supply chain flexibility; logistics flexibility refers to the ability of an enterprise to respond quickly and effectively to changes in customer demand for transportation, delivery, and services. Logistics flexibility includes four important elements: logistics supply flexibility, procurement flexibility, distribution flexibility, and demand management flexibility. Using the concept of two-level planning to build a port collection and distribution network optimization model in the supply chain environment and analyze related examples to find the best route for port transportation, the attributes related to port flexibility are selected from the perspectives of strategic flexibility, system flexibility, service provider flexibility, and organizational flexibility. The test outcomes of this document show the radiation capacity of Haikou port is relatively strong, the proportion of people who think it is excellent is 60%, and the proportion of people who think that the radiation ability of Haikou Port is good is 20%. Haikou Port has a good resource utilization capacity; 70% think its resource utilization rate is good, and 20% think its resource utilization is very good. Haikou Port's response capability is relatively average compared to Kia's capability, and even 10% of people think that Haikou Port's response capability is very average, so Haikou Port needs to strengthen training for port response capabilities. According to the operating flexibility data, the informatization development of Haikou Port is showing a good level. © 2022 Lei Wen et al.},

The objective is to minimize total cost. The network must be dynamically reconfigured (i.e., by opening facilities, expanding and/or contracting their capacities, and closing facilities) over time to accommodate changing trends in demand and/or costs. The problem involves a multi-period, multi-product, multi-echelon supply chain. Research objectives of this paper are a traditional formulation and a network-based model of the DSCR problem; tests to promote intuitive interpretation of our models; tests to identify computational characteristics of each model to determine if one offers superior solvability; and tests to identify sensitivity of run time relative to primary parameters. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose - Supply chain flexibility has been acknowledged as a necessity in the context of constantly changing operational and service requirements in the global marketplace. However, limited research has focused on analyzing and empirically testing the dynamics of achieving enhanced flexibility performance. Drawing upon the knowledge-based view of the firm, the purpose of this paper is to address this research gap by introducing supply chain learning (SCL) and integration as key factors in the process. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data were collected in India. Structural equation modeling technique was used as the main analysis method to test the proposed conceptual model on SCL, integration, and flexibility performance. Findings - Research findings indicate that the supply chain integration construct (in its internal and external dimensions) mediates the proposed SCL-flexibility performance relationship. The analysis also confirms the positive relationship between cross-functional integration and inter-firm integration. Research limitations/implications - Focusing on only one country may limit the generalizability of the findings. Also, cross-sectional data collection may not be the ideal approach for evaluating the impacts of SCL. Therefore, future research with longitudinal data and in different contexts is warranted to validate the research results of this study. Originality/value - The proposed conceptual model adds to the limited existing knowledge body of SCL and links SCL, integration, and flexibility performance. It also provides a new venue for future research in this area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Supply chain management is an activity that effectively integrates suppliers, companies, retailers where goods are produced and distributed at the right quality, location, and time with minimum cost levels to provide the highest quality services for consumers. Supply chain agility, supply chain adaptability, supply chain alignment, which is known as the Triple-A strategy, are elements to form supply chain performance. In this study, we tried to apply it to SMEs in developing countries, such as Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to show whether it is true that the supply chain cannot be applied to SMEs, while for a disruption as it is today, competition is getting tougher not only among SMEs but also against large companies, and SMEs need to develop several strategies that were previously unimaginable. This study uses quantitative techniques to determine the effect of supply chain agility, supply chain adaptability, supply chain alignment on supply chain performance either partially or simultaneously. The results showed that all hypotheses were accepted. This shows that supply chain management can be a strategy to create better SMEs performance and can even be used to achieve competitive advantage. © 2022 Growing Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Competition is no longer company to company, but supply chain to supply chain and flexibility is viewed as a key dimension of supply chain performance in global competition recently. Companies must manage the entire supply chain and work together with supply chain node enterprises, have access to resources, knowledge, and information from the network, and improve supply chain flexibility. Relational embeddedness is often considered as crucial driver for the improvement of supply chain flexibility. However, quantitative studies demonstrating these links are scant and an increasing amount of evidence suggests that there is a need to develop a complete model of relational embeddedness on supply chain flexibility by examining the potential mediating effect of absorptive capacity. To meet this need, we define relational embeddedness and absorptive capacity, develop a valid and reliable instrument to measure these, build a framework that relates relational embeddedness, absorptive capacity and supply chain flexibility, and then test structural relationships within this framework using SPSS. Based on 136 responses from companies in the Yangtze River Delta, statistically significant and partially positive relationships were found among relational embeddedness, absorptive capacity and supply chain flexibility.

abstract={The reliability of supply partners is particularly vital in agile supply chains as it is vulnerable to the inability of a supply partner to meet its high responsiveness and flexibility requirements resulting in the disruption of the whole network. Disruption can have expensive and extensive results for the entire agile supply chain. To mitigate the risk of disruption and improve the reliability of the whole agile supply chain, decision-makers need to pay more attention to supply chain design and construction while simultaneously taking into account the sourcing strategy decisions. This paper proposes a series of models for the design of agile supply chains using dynamic programming modeling. These provide decision-makers with a systematic way of analyzing one of the key decisions of sourcing strategy, namely the trade-off between the number of supply partners and reliability. The efficacy of the models is demonstrated through their application to a Chinese bus and coach manufacturer by way of an empirical illustration. The results show that this approach is effective for this application, and it can be applied in other related decision-making scenarios. The methods offered in this paper provide managers with a practical tool to design their agile supply chains while considering the trade-offs between the number of partners and the reliability of the entire agile supply chain. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

However, supply chains are susceptible to unanticipated events that make responsive supply chain management a challenging task. One such disruption event is a product stockout at the retailer. In this paper, we investigate retail stockouts through the development of an agent-based simulation model in order to develop a better understanding of the effect of different stockout lengths for different products (with different consumer response profiles to stockouts) on both the retailer and the manufacturer of the product. We consider the change of market share as a measure of resilience for both the manufacturer and the retailer to examine the impact of the stockout. Insights are developed for manufacturers and retailers in responding to the stockout disruption. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The necessity for creating flexible and agile supply chains and adapt on the continuously changing and quite competitive e-commerce logistics market, has made warehousing a strategically critical component of the supply chains. In response to that, new logistics concepts such as on-demand logistics and shared warehousing popped up recently, which with the help of the e-marketplaces offer innovative logistics solutions through a single access point and support the logistics actors to: easily optimize the capacity of their warehouse, avoid the fixed costs of owning a warehouse; implement short-term supply chain planning and finally come closer to the end-customer. Although several on-demand warehousing practices can be seen worldwide, the Greek economic crisis delayed until recently the emergence of such trends so, little is known on how the Greek market would respond to such changes. In response to that, this paper introduces briefly the first on-demand warehousing platform to be operating in Greece and closes the knowledge gap on the Greek market’s response following a three-step methodological process: conducting a dedicated questionnaire survey circulated to different types of businesses, arranging logistics expert groups and carrying out extensive desktop research. The paper shows that the Greek stakeholders are quite familiar to shared warehousing solutions and they are open to digital changes such as using an on-demand warehousing platform. However, they are less willing to apply such innovations to their daily business. Therefore, specific platform requirements for increasing the attractiveness of such tools to the Greek market are also highlighted. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={We consider a financially constrained supply chain in which a supplier (leader) sells products to a retailer (follower) who has no access to bank financing due to her low credit rating. However, the supplier can borrow from a bank and offer trade credit to the retailer to alleviate her financial constraint. Failure to pay off a bank loan or trade credit incurs a variable default cost. We analyze the centralized version of the supply chain to obtain new coordination requirements. We then examine whether revenue-sharing, buyback, and all-unit quantity discount contracts can coordinate our supply chain. We show that the all-unit quantity discount contract fails to coordinate. However, the revenue-sharing and buyback contracts can coordinate the supply chain, but only when the supply chain has a sufficient total working capital. Moreover, they cannot allocate profit flexibly unless the supplier has a large enough working capital. Finally, we design a generalized revenue-sharing contract that coordinates the supply chain with flexible profit allocation, and also show by numerical examples its superiority over the revenue-sharing and buyback contracts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Modern distributed applications are embedding an increasing degree of dynamism, from dynamic supply-chain management, enterprise federations, and virtual collaborations to dynamic resource acquisitions and service interactions across organizations. Such dynamism leads to new challenges in security and dependability. Collaborating services in a system with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) may belong to different security realms but often need to be engaged dynamically at runtime. If their security realms do not have a direct cross-realm authentication relationship, it is technically difficult to enable any secure collaboration between the services. A potential solution to this would be to locate intermediate realms at runtime, which serve as an authentication path between the two separate realms. However, the process of generating an authentication path for two distributed services can be highly complicated. It could involve a large number of extra operations for credential conversion and require a long chain of invocations to intermediate services. In this paper, we address this problem by designing and implementing a new cross-realm authentication protocol for dynamic service interactions, based on the notion of service-oriented multiparty business sessions. Our protocol requires neither credential conversion nor establishment of any authentication path between the participating services in a business session. The correctness of the protocol is formally analyzed and proven, and an empirical study is performed using two production-quality Grid systems, Globus 4 and CROWN. The experimental results indicate that the proposed protocol and its implementation have a sound level of scalability and impose only a limited degree of performance overhead, which is for example comparable with those security-related overheads in Globus 4. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Frequent natural hazards such as flooding and the devastating consequences of severe events make the humanitarian supply chain particularly important in alleviating the suffering of those communities impacted by such events. However, the ambiguity of information and the different goals of stakeholders demand that the humanitarian supply chain must be resilient. This research adopts the use of literature review and expert opinions to identify the indicators that affect the resilience of the humanitarian supply chain using the flood event in Hechuan District, China in 2020 as an example. Based on the combination of fuzzy Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and Analytic Network Process (fuzzy-DEMATEL-ANP), the interrelationships between the indicators and the weights of each indicator are calculated. The research results indicate that decision-makers in the humanitarian supply chain should vigorously coordinate the cooperation among stakeholders, ensure the effective transmission of information, and formulate forward-looking strategic plans. At the same time, these key decision makers should also be aware of the need to adjust their strategies at different stages of the flooding event in order to achieve a flexible humanitarian supply chain that responds to the varying demands over the course of a flooding event. The results of this study will help professionals involved in humanitarian supply chains to develop strategies and plans to become more resilient thus helping to reduce losses from natural hazards such as floods. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={With increasing frequency and intensity of disasters and large number of people being affected by them, the subject needs more attention and a planned approach. And in order to reduce the adverse impact of disasters and to improve the disaster relief practices, academicians and practitioners are emphasizing on a number of diverse factors of humanitarian supply chain by segmenting them into different clusters. This research is intended to address the critical success factors (CSFs) of humanitarian supply chain which emerges during disaster preparedness and immediate response phase. Through a review of literature and expert consultation, 12 critical success factors leading to responsive humanitarian supply chains have been identified. In this paper, the authors have used Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) approach to interpret the interdependency among the selected CSFs. In addition, MICMAC (Matrice d'Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement (cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification)) analysis is also used to illustrate the relative driving and dependence power among the selected factors. This paper argues that, Government policies and Organizational structure is the most dominating factor which has the highest driving power and the minimum dependence power as it drive others factors and forms the base of interpretive structure model. The outcome of this research presents the insight of humanitarian supply chain practices and discussion from both a researcher and managerial perspective is also summarized. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Resilience is a basic and important property of supply chain system and has attracted great interest during recent years. In cell biology field, cell elasticity is also an important property to determine cell movement and deformation. So considering the similarities between supply chain system and cell biology and based on cell elasticity theory, in this paper we focus on a pharmaceutical supply chain and provide a resilience characteristic factor set of this supply chain. Then we propose a quantitative model and analyze the resilience adaptation and recovery process of the pharmaceutical supply chain under impacts of sudden risk events. Finally, a numeral example is given for illustrative purposes. The result shows that the pharmaceutical supply chain can adapt to external shocks at the beginning and then recover to normal condition gradually after it disappears. Our research may provide a new and effective method for supply chain resilience measurement and enrich pharmaceutical supply chain risk management system. © 2012 ISSN 1881-803X.},

abstract={Innovation is the continuous source of power for the survival and development of SMEs, but the complexity of innovation and the limitation of resources make SMEs trapped in the di-lemma of “innovation difficulty.” A moderated mediating model was constructed based on social network theory and resource view, and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used to empirically study the influence mechanism between network relationship characteristics and SMEs’ innovation and the configuration path to achieve SMEs’ high innovation performance. The results show that the characteristics of network relationships positively affect the innovation performance of SMEs. Supply chain dynamic capability plays an intermediary role between network relationships and SMEs’ innovation relationships. Different geographical proximity levels of the supply chain lead to different coordination interaction and knowledge sharing efficiency between upstream and downstream, which not only positively moderates the relationship between supply chain dynamic capability and SMEs’ innovation performance, but also moderates its mediating effect. Furthermore, the fs QCA analysis results show three configurations for SMEs’ high innovation performance based on the characteristics of network relations: geographic proximity regulating type, network relationship dominant type, and dynamic coordination and integration type. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={This paper studies a two-period supply chain that consists of a retailer and a supplier. A newsvendor-like retailer is capital constrained and orders products using a supplier's trade credits to satisfy uncertain market demand. Most existing studies show that the retailer always postpones payment until the due date. To recall the loans earlier, we present a case in which the supplier, as a Stackelberg leader, offers an incentive of a discounted wholesale price in the second order to entice the retailer to choose flexible early payment. The proposed incentive is related to the retailer's early payment time in the first period. In the presence of bankruptcy risks for both the retailer and supplier, we propose a continuous newsvendor model of a two-period supply chain to analyze the decisions involved in the flexible trade credit contract. The analytic forms confirm that such an incentive can improve the decentralized supply chain efficiency and decreases the supplier's trade credit risk. The retailer always prefers early payment to payment around the due date to increase revenues. Furthermore, the action of paying early might help the retailer adjust cash flow between the two periods. We also find that a revenue sharing contract significantly affects the retailer's payment behavior and supplier's wholesale price. The numerical simulations support our results. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Nowadays, a trend of forming dynamic supply chains with different trading partners over different e-marketplaces has emerged. These supply chains, which are called "supply mesh," generally refer to heterogeneous electronic marketplaces in which dynamic supply chains, as per project (often make-to-order), are formed across different parties. Conceptually, in a supply mesh a dynamic supply chain is formed vertically, mediating several companies for a project. Companies that are on the same level horizontally are either competitors or cohorts. A complex scenario such as this makes it challenging to find the right group of members for a dynamic supply chain. Earlier on, a multiagent model called the collaborative single machine earliness/tardiness (CSET) model was proposed for the optimal formation of make-to-order supply chains. This paper contributes the particular agent designs, for enabling the mediation of CSET in a supply mesh, and the possibilities are discussed. It is demonstrated via a computer simulation, based on samples from the U.S. textile industry, that by using intelligent agents under the CSET model it is possible to automatically find an ideal group of trading partners from a supply mesh. © 2014 Hang Yang et al.},

abstract={A new e-Service model called dynamic supply chain is characterized by their dynamic nature in easily being formed and disbanded with the seamless connectivity provided by e-Marketplace. The new term "supply mesh" was coined to represent this virtual community of companies in which dynamic supply chains, as per project (also known as make-to-order), are formed across different tiers of suppliers. In a supply mesh, a dynamic supply chain can be formed vertically, from the top to the bottom layers, mediating different companies for a project. Companies that are on the same level laterally are usually competitors, and the companies that are linked vertically as supply chains are trading partners. From a global view, the companies that are connected in the supply mesh can be viewed as individual entities that have self-interest. They may compete for survival as well as collaborate with each other for jobs. Given such complex relations the challenge is to find an optimal group of members for a dynamic supply chain in the supply mesh. A multi-agent model called the collaborative single machine earliness/tardiness (CSET) model was recently proposed for the optimal formation of make-to-order supply chains. This paper investigates the possibilities of applying CSET in a supply mesh, and the corresponding allocation schemes are experimentally studied in simulations. One scheme called Cost-driven principle leads to destructive competition while the other one namely Pareto-optimal evolves into a cooperative competition that tries to mutually benefit every participant. The results, based on samples from the U.S. textile industry, show that a cooperative competition scheme is superior in terms of optimal allocation, which obtains maximum satisfaction for all participants. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Recovery of the industrial waste heat is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach for the energy supply in cities. The industrial waste heat supply chain is a typical multi-objective closed-loop system that aims at optimizing both the economic and environmental benefits through proper operations during supply, purchase, distribution, and consumption. Different from conventional waste heat recovery (WHR), the mobile waste heat recovery (M-WHR) implanted recovery vehicles to facility heat collection and distribution. As a new and cost-sensitive channel for the WHR industry, the dynamic supply chain of the M-WHR has seldom been studied. This study proposed a numerical model to investigate such a dynamic system and conducted a case study to verify the models. The results suggested that by optimizing the production plan based on the market demand, the supply chain can reach the Pareto state and minimize its production cost and idle production recourses. The results of the designed numerical examples verify the robustness of the operation strategy. Also, with proper government subsidies, the investment in constructing the WHR supply chain is profitable and the payback period can be reduced. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={Value co-creation provides an effective way to prevent and control risks in supply chain enterprises. By building a three-stage supply chain game decision model under risk conditions, rational derivation is made on the dynamic relationship between supply chain flexibility management costs, flexible benefits, unit product costs, and supply chain value creation to investigate conditions required to achieve supply chain value co-creation and optimal flexibility management. Some useful conclusions were finding that the functional relationship between flexibility management cost and supply chain value co-creation is represented as the envelope curve of optimal supply chain value creation and supply chain risks, flexible benefit, and unit product cost exert a significant impact on supply chain flexibility management effect. This article proposes that under certain supply chain risks, companies should maximise the marginal benefits of supply chain flexibility management inputs, so that supply chain flexibility management inputs show positive benefits rather than cost effects.

abstract={In the context of the digital economy, establishing close strategic partnerships to cope with market uncertainties is an important strategic choice for firms seeking to achieve sustainable development in developing countries, particularly in Eastern culture. However, research on how strategic partnerships affect enterprise performance remains controversial. To address this issue, based on the supply chain management practices of Chinese enterprises in the era of the digital economy, and according to resource dependence theory, social network theory, and transaction cost theory, a chain multiple intermediary model was constructed and 243 Chinese enterprises information was collected for an empirical test. The results show that strategic partnership has a significant direct positive impact on information sharing, supply chain flexibility, and enterprise performance. Information sharing has a significant direct positive impact on enterprise performance and plays a partial mediating role between strategic partnership and enterprise performance. Supply chain flexibility was also found to positively impact enterprise performance and plays a partial mediating role between strategic partnership and enterprise performance. The findings also showed that information sharing and supply chain flexibility play a chain mediating role between strategic partnership and enterprise performance. This study explores the effects of strategic partnership on enterprise performance, which provides an important supplement to theoretical studies of supply chain management. The results help provide targeted solutions on how to effectively implement supply chain management for enterprises in emerging and developing nations. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to systematically review the academic literature on Supply Chain Learning (SCL), including the definitions, drivers, sources, barriers and consequences of SCL, and to propose an integrated conceptual model. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review has been conducted, with an analysis of 123 papers in peer-reviewed academic journals published from 1998 up to March 2018. Findings: Through analysis and synthesis of the literature, this paper identifies and classifies the concepts of SCL into four types, that is, process orientation, structure orientation, consequence orientation and other informal definitions. Based on the Extended Resource-Based View (ERBV), the authors develop an integrated conceptual framework, which brings together various constructs. Within the framework, the authors identify the drivers and sources of SCL at intra- and inter-organizational levels. SCL consists of exploratory and exploitive learning capabilities, and the outcomes of SCL are dynamic supply chain management capabilities and sustainable supply chain performance. Originality/value: The authors propose a capability perspective of SCL and develop a conceptual model and a number of associated propositions of SCL based on the ERBV and review findings, which is subject to future empirical testing and propose five future research directions. The findings of this paper can be extended beyond the dyad and be applied in multi-tier supply chain context. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Supply chain resilience has been suggested to curb the impact of disruptions on supply chains. While this proposition seems coherent in theory, empirical evidence supporting this is limited, as existing literature has centred on exploring the impact of supply chain resilience on disruptions which are based on set time frames, non-supply chain specific as well as examining non-dynamic disruptive events. This study contends that resilience strategies are dynamic and as such their applications within supply chains differ. Therefore examining the impact of resilience will be appropriate on a dynamic disruption within a specific supply chain. In view of this, the paper examines through existing literature the applicability of agility within the pharmaceutical supply chain when dynamic disruptions like drug shortages occur. The study finds alertness, accessibility, connectivity and visibility as dimensions of supply chain agility that are capable of reducing the impact of drug shortages. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Objective: This paper proposes a multi attribute decision support model in a supply chain in order to solve complex decision problems. The paper provides a platform to ease decision process through the integration of quality function deployment (QFD) and grey relational analysis (GRA) in demonstrating main supply chain drivers under fuzzy environment. Methodology: The proposed method is important because of several points: First of all, in a supply chain system, evaluation factors are not really independent and must be addressed in relation to the external factors such as customer requirements. Hence, we have applied QFD tool. Second, due to the constant uncertainty in the supply chain environment, fuzziness among the factors has to be considered. So, an interval valued fuzzy model was implemented. Third, to examine the proposed decision system in reality, it was applied in Risk and Uncertain Conditions for Agriculture Production Systems (RUC-APS) project. Contribution: An integrated version of QFD and GRA is presented. It is assumed that QFD can act to measure optimal solutions based on the distance to ideal solutions. In an interval-valued fuzzy environment the enormous volume of computation by Euclidean distance doesn't allow decision makers to obtain the results easily. This drawback is addressed using gray relational analysis. The gray relational coefficient is integrated to the fuzzy QFD to measure the distance of potential solutions from ideal solutions. This integration facilitates decision making process in further problems once big data are available. Results: To obtain the importance degrees of logistic indicators in the supply chain, expert team considered the environmental, social & cultural, and economic factors as external dimension of the QFD. The other dimension of QFD includes supply chain drivers such as quality, environmental management system, supply chain flexibility, corporate social responsibility, transportation service condition, and financial stability. The decision model is solved and the ranking of indicators is achieved. A sensitivity analysis helps to test and check the performance of the decision model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Extant studies identify different strategic approaches for businesses to integrate environment management (EM) into corporate supply chain management (SCM) to create different competitive market advantages. With increasing market uncertainties, stakeholder complexities, constraints of resources, companies nowadays are required to develop more context-specific solutions for mitigating sustainability risk and improving market performance in supply chain sustainability practices. To address the challenges faced by businesses, this study aims to explore how a company adapts green supply chain strategies for a competitive transformation. Specifically, we aim to identify different green supply chain capabilities that form hybrid choices of green solutions for a company to leverage an adaptive green shift. Through an extensive literature review, this study proposes a conceptual framework for exploration which is based on a qualitative in-depth case study in the electronics industry—one of the most polluting manufacturing sectors in China. The findings show that supply chain characteristics play a significant role in the selection of different green SCM solutions by businesses. We find different hybrid choices of strategic decisions are being made by the case company operating with high-volume and high-value supply chains respectively. High-volume supply chains adopt both operational pollution and waste control strategies and incremental green product strategies to balance cost of operational change and develop a competitive eco-efficient market expansion. In contrast, high-value supply chains adopt radical green product innovation strategies and operational waste prevention strategies to balance cost of product innovation and build operational efficiency to expand in a competitive eco-differentiation market. A mix of dynamic capabilities involved in different supply chain green transformations are also identified. © 2022 by the authors.},

The global COVID-19 outbreak, combined with the growing complexity of supply chain networks, has exposed supply chains’ vulnerability to disruption. Therefore, improving the supply chain viability is the primary way to deal with the risk of supply chain disruption. Using the method of literature research, this conceptual paper systematically reviewed and sorted out relevant literature, extracted corresponding capabilities, and put forward relevant research propositions. From the perspective of the resource-based view and resource-dependent theory, this study investigates specific dimensions of the blockchain-enabled supply chain capability: connectivity, network capability, and supply chain reconfiguration and the impact of external resource-dependent capability on the viability of the supply chain. The propositions show that the blockchain-enabled supply chain capability, and external resource-dependent capability will positively impact supply chain viability.

abstract={Purpose: As the event industry is supported by a wide range of suppliers that provide different products and services, all these partners in the supply chain can play a crucial role in green practices. The industry needs to have a sufficient degree of supply chain flexibility to cater to the demands in today’s dynamic environment and the flexibility in the supply chain will help event businesses to be sustainable. This study aims to explore the role of the supply chain flexibility fit between event planner’s requirements and supplier offerings on the implementation of green practices. The study also attempted to provide insights into the adoption of green event practices by identifying the moderating roles of green organization image and public pressure. Design/methodology/approach: Data analysis was conducted based on 207 useable responses from event planners. Polynomial regression and response surface analysis were performed to verify the hypothesized relationships. Additionally, hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the moderating effects of green organization image and public pressure on the proposed relationships. Findings: Results revealed that product flexibility fit was positively related to green practices; however, such effect was not found in the volume flexibility fit model. Findings also showed that public pressure significantly improved the positive effect of product flexibility fit on green practices. However, the green organization image was found to have no significant moderating effect. Practical implications: The adoption of green practices requires well-designed collaboration among supply chain partners. This study offers empirical evidence regarding the importance of achieving product flexibility fit between event planners’ requirements and supplier offerings when conducting green practices. The findings provide useful implications that can be applied for successful green event management. Originality/value: Despite the significance and relevance of the topic, barely any study has been conducted to assess supply chain flexibility and its relationship with green event practices. The study adopted resource orchestration theory to examine the role of supply chain flexibility on green event practices by focusing on the planner-supplier flexibility fit. A number of implications regarding supply chain management and future research are identified. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop research frameworks for two types of green supply chains based on Fisher's seminal work. In spite of Fisher's contribution to the literature, his study has rarely been extended into green supply chain contexts, except in a few conceptual arguments. The current study explores how Fisher's perspective of efficient versus responsive supply chains can be a stepping stone to the development of two green supply chains: eco-efficient and eco-responsive supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: Toward the above end, a case methodology is employed (Yin). Two Korean global companies, Pohang Iron and Steel Company (POSCO) and Samsung Electronics (SEC), are selected to explore eco-efficient and eco-responsive supply chains. POSCO (steel products) is selected to enable the understanding of how efficient and eco-efficient supply chains work. SEC (mobile phone products) is chosen to understand responsive and eco-responsive supply chains. Findings: The findings suggest that POSCO tends to stress process technology innovation as a means to address green pressures, while SEC accentuates the green product strategy; while an eco-efficient supply chain focuses on keeping to an environmental standard across the supply chains, an eco-responsive supply chain centers on the collaboration of suppliers and distributors in greening the supply chain; and SEC takes more initiatives to educate and encourage consumers to engage in recycling activities than POSCO does. Originality/value: Few studies have examined the green supply chain using the perspective of Fisher's framework (efficient vs responsive supply chains). By addressing the timely topic, this study fills a research gap in green supply chain literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The exchange of information sharing, however, may not ensure the expected quality outcomes of information. To test the mediating role of mutual trust between information sharing and information quality, this study uniquely examines four contexts of information sharing (receiving information from customers; receiving information from suppliers; providing information to customers; and providing information to suppliers). With two theoretical lenses, attribution theory and transaction cost theory, this study empirically investigates the interrelationships among information sharing, information quality, mutual trust, and supply chain flexibility with data from 74 Korean steel firms. The results suggest that: 1 attribution error (i.e., self-service bias) is likely to happen when it comes to providing information context 2 mutual trust plays a crucial role in transferring information sharing into information quality. Implications as well as future research opportunities are provided. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This article discusses how supply chain information capabilities are instrumental to achieve performance outcomes. We identify critical components of supply chain information capabilities in terms of inter-organizational information system capacity and inter-organizational relational competency. In view of the high degree of industry concentration in Korea, this article presents and tests a research model using a sample of Korean steel suppliers. Empirical tests are conducted using the structural equation modeling, PLS (partial least squares). The results of this study suggest that Korean manufacturing (e.g., automobile, shipbuilding, construction, and mobile industries) are heavily influenced by the competitiveness of the steel industry in terms of supply chain information capabilities and performance outcomes - supply chain-level (i.e., supply chain flexibility) and firm-level performance outcomes (i.e., customer responsiveness and cost reductions). Future research may extend the findings of this study in other country contexts to accomplish both customer responsiveness and cost reductions through supply chain information capabilities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Although flexibility has been considered critical in responding to uncertainty in a business environment, few studies have explored firms' flexibility in sustainable development. To understand the nature of firms that can respond better to uncertainty in their sustainable development practices, this study defines sustainable development flexibility and investigates the mechanism underlying its formation. The study proposes a conceptual framework on the interactions of managers' environmental attitude and cognitive style, as well as firms' information integration on sustainable development flexibility. A questionnaire survey was developed to test the corresponding hypotheses, and 241 valid responses were received from middle- and top-level managers in Chinese firms. The results show that (a) the higher the manager's environmental attitude, the higher the firm's information integration and greater sustainable supply chain flexibility, and (b) the more intuitive the manager's cognitive style, the greater the impact of environmental attitude on sustainable development flexibility. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a case study of comparative four companies in order to obtain an in-depth knowledge of the environmental conditions under which the companies implement different types of supply chain risk management (SCRM) strategies: logistics flexibility and relationship flexibility. Findings: The case analysis not only distinguished the different effects of objective and perceived environmental uncertainty on supply chain flexibility, but also established the propositions about the effects of the consistency between objective and perceived environmental uncertainty on logistics flexibility and relationship flexibility in SCRM. Originality/value: In principle, supply chain flexibility aims to cope with complex and turbulent environments. Yet, empirical findings about the effects of environmental uncertainty on supply chain flexibility are inconclusive.

To investigate the approach to enhance supply chain flexibility, the purpose of this paper is to propose that both internal and external information integration contribute to reactive and proactive supply chain flexibilities, which elicit high operational performance. Design/methodology/approach – Using a sample of 84 food companies that have been listed three years in China and content analysis based on their annual reports, evidence was collected to test the hypotheses through hierarchical regressions. Findings – The results reveal that external information integration results in both reactive and proactive flexibilities, which further improve operational performance. Internal information integration positively affects both reactive and proactive flexibilities, but its mediating role was not determined in the study.

abstract={A highly volatile and uncertain environment has accelerated the operational speed of supply chains, with an increasing number of manufacturers implementing quicker and more flexible strategies in their supply chain management. Recognizing that greater cross-functional and cross-company efforts to increase flexibility were making a focus limited to manufacturing flexibility insufficient to deal with a more complex and turbulent environment, a growing body of literature began to look beyond the flexible factory to the flexible supply chain. Although researchers reach an agreement with a depiction of flexibility as a capability of responding to uncertainty at minimal cost, the effect of environmental uncertainty on flexibility is not consistent in different empirical studies, representing at least three perspectives: a positive effect, a negative effect, and no effect. Measuring objective environment uncertainty (OEU) and perceived environment uncertainty (PEU) separately, this study explores their effects on supply chain flexibility. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Effective demand management is an essential part of operations management, especially in the fashion industry. It helps enterprises avoid sales losses, increase inventory turnover, and raise firm performance. The major sources of effective and efficient demand management practices derive from the improvement in demand chain alignment competence (DCAC). By integrating dynamic capability theory and upper echelon theory, the present research discusses the role of DCAC and explores its main antecedents and consequences. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and hierarchical linear regression are conducted to analyze the data collected from 156 fashion enterprises. The results from qualitative interviews and quantitative analysis indicate that managerial cognition (MC) is a critical antecedent of DCAC. In addition, supply chain flexibility has a significantly positive moderating effect on the relationship between MC and DCAC. Further, DCAC primarily predicts firm performance. Finally, novel theoretical and empirical insights are discussed. © Vilnius University, 2002-2017.},

abstract={As part of the supposed approach to strengthen the competitive capacity of industrial companies based on the implementation of the control of innovative activities in the supply chain, the flexible evaluation system was developed, differentiated according to the strategic and tactical objectives of the existing growth of competitive capacity. The strategic management of innovation process supposes achievement of competitive advantages based upon maximal usage of the experience of innovative supply chain activity organization and accounting of new factors, which influence on their change. To solve this problem have been analyzed conditions that determine the appearance and replace the six models of innovative process, allocated based on the modern world scientific experience. The logic of their development allows us to see the important characteristics of their changes, explain the effectiveness of the change process models, through the manifestation of the cumulative and complementary effects. The authors proposed a system of indicators to monitor the degree of manifestation of these effects in the study. In the course of the calculations have been identified changes in the patterns of the innovation process in the Russian mining and metallurgical complex and at the same time as there was a cumulative and complementary effect in changing patterns, and thus the efficiency of controlling innovation. The results suggest that the implementation of controlling innovation in mining and metallurgical enterprises cannot be called successful. Sustained growth was observed on single indicators.

abstract={With the ever-increasing need for clean and accessible energy sources, biomass has long been considered as a potential prospect. Malaysia is one of the leading suppliers and has the largest palm oil plantation in the world. Therefore, biomass from the palm oil industry appears to be a very promising alternative source of raw materials, including for renewable energy, in Malaysia. However, ensuring the environmental sustainability of the biomass supply chain (BSC) is one of the major challenges faced by the biomass industry. Therefore, this paper aims to assess the effect of changing the efficiency of transportation technology (TT) and production technology (PT) on the environmental sustainability of the palm oil BSC. We developed a dynamic simulation model to explore the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 50 years (2000–2050) for three palm biomass suppliers (Johor, Perak and Pahang) in Malaysia. Results show that supplier in Perak produced the highest rate of GHG emissions in the whole system. Also, suppliers in Johor and Perak had the highest GHG emissions with 180–240 million tonnes (mt) CO2 equivalent (CO2e) and 375–400 mt CO2e, respectively, from transportation of empty fruit bunches (EFB) product. In terms of production, the supplier in Perak had the highest (and constant value) of GHG emissions (up to 160 mt CO2e). The analysis shows that the supplier in Pahang generated the lowest level of GHG emissions. Our findings suggest that improvement of the transportation and production efficiency of BSC should be the priority to work towards the sustainable development of the palm biomass industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Manufacturing digitalisation and the growth of big data promises to foster more responsive supply chains and to close gaps between manufacturers and consumers, leading to highly-connected manufacturing operations, mass customisation and more sustainable production. There is widespread recognition that manufacturing in broad terms is entering a new period of transition and change, aided by new technologies and business models and with multiple predictions that there will be significant reconfigurations in the geographical and inclusive distribution of manufacturing operations. A concept that can be used to describe this process of transformation is called redistributed manufacturing. This concept encompasses the empowerment of consumer-inclusive co-creation. In this paper, we investigate whether and how big data can facilitate redistributed manufacturing in consumer goods industries. The research sheds light on how businesses are starting to redistribute their functions among various stakeholders including consumers and co-creating value. The paper proposes a conceptual framework to stimulate and organise thinking about emerging interrelationships between big data, co-creation and redistributed manufacturing, built upon an extensive literature review and qualitative analysis of 15 cases from the consumer goods industry using primary and secondary data. Through these cases, we analyse existing co-creation practices in consumer goods industries, and how they are evolving their manufacturing configurations, their underlying drivers, the role of big data applications, and their impacts on the redistribution of manufacturing. Our analysis finds that big data applications are supporting and prompting redistributed manufacturing approaches in these consumer goods industries. © 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This article studies port strategy from a supply chain perspective considering the case of Hong Kong. Hong Kong port used to be the world's busiest container port, but it is now in danger of losing its hub status due to rising competition from neighboring lower-cost rivals. The analysis shows that Hong Kong's free port status and world-class customs clearance offer the port a sustainable and considerable advantage to shorten transit time. The port is thus a strategic fit for the shipping of high-value and time-sensitive cargoes, and should pursue an agile strategy for a responsive supply chain. It is imperative for the port to strengthen its core competencies in agility by retaining a favorable position in port rotation with shipping lines and raising the efficiency of barging. Further reducing cost substantially would be beneficial, but might not be feasible and should not be the primary nor sole focus of policy makers and port operators. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The advertisement can increase the consumers demand; therefore it is one of the most important marketing strategies in the operations management of enterprises. This paper aims to analyze the impact of advertising investment on a discrete dynamic supply chain network which consists of suppliers, manufactures, retailers, and demand markets associated at different tiers under random demand. The impact of advertising investment will last several planning periods besides the current period due to delay effect. Based on noncooperative game theory, variational inequality, and Lagrange dual theory, the optimal economic behaviors of the suppliers, the manufactures, the retailers, and the consumers in the demand markets are modeled. In turn, the supply chain network equilibrium model is proposed and computed by modified project contraction algorithm with fixed step. The effectiveness of the model is illustrated by numerical examples, and managerial insights are obtained through the analysis of advertising investment in multiple periods and advertising delay effect among different periods. © 2014 Guitao Zhang et al.},

abstract={We consider a supply chain in which a manufacturer stimulates his retailers investing more local advertising expenditures through a cooperative advertising program (Co-op). Co-op advertising programs usually involve two important contractual terms, a participation rate and an accrual rate. While previous literatures have discussed the participation rate excessively, they seldom study the role of the accrual rate in cooperative advertising. To investigate the impact of the accrual rate on cooperative advertising decisions, we develop a dynamic cooperative advertising model for a single manufacturer–single retailer supply chain that incorporates the participation rate and the accrual rate simultaneously. We derive the equilibrium co-op decisions of two channel members, including the manufacturer’s national advertising efforts and his participation rate, as well as the retailer’s local advertising expenditure. Our analysis of the equilibrium solutions shows that an increase in participation rate will not always increase the retailer’s advertising efforts because of the accrual rate. Also, both the manufacturer and retailer can benefit from a high accrual rate. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This paper studies the setting in which a one-of-a-kind production (OKP) firm offers two types of orders (due-date guaranteed and due-date unguaranteed) at different prices to the sequentially arriving customers, who are also OKP production firms. The prices for two types of orders are quoted to each customer on its arrival. We study two problems in this setting. First, we model a dynamic pricing strategy (DPS) and compare our DPS with a constant pricing strategy (CPS). Through a numerical test, we show that both the firm and its customers are better off when our DPS is employed, so that the DPS improves overall performance of the supply chain. Through an industry case, a custom window production firm, we show how to apply the proposed DPS when products are complex. We also develop a method to adaptively estimate the firms available capacity, the number of future arrivals and the distributions of the customers willingness to pay and impatience factor. The simulation result shows that, when multiple distribution parameters are unknown, the proposed parameter estimating method results in estimates close to the true values. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Purpose: Intellectual capital reflects the sum of existing knowledge a manufacturer is able to leverage and plays a critical role in new product development. The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the mechanisms through which intellectual capital enhances product innovation performance and how economic and institutional environments affect the mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: Using a knowledge-based view and institutional theory, this study proposes a model on the relationships among intellectual capital, supplier knowledge integration, supply chain adaptability, and product innovation performance. The hypotheses are empirically tested using multiple group structural equation modelling and data collected from 300 Chinese and 200 Indian manufacturers. Findings: The authors find that intellectual capital improves product innovation performance both directly and indirectly through supplier knowledge integration. However, the effects are different in China and India. In particular, the direct effect of intellectual capital on product innovation performance is significantly higher in China than that in India, and intellectual capital improves product innovation performance indirectly through supplier knowledge integration only in India. The authors also find that supplier knowledge integration improves product innovation performance indirectly through supply chain adaptability in both China and India. Originality/value: Using a moderated mediation model, this study provides insights into the joint effects of intellectual capital, supplier knowledge integration, and supply chain adaptability on product innovation performance. The findings enhance current understandings of how supply chain management helps a manufacturer develop new products using existing knowledge and the influences of economic and institutional environments on knowledge and supply chain management. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Supply chain network is more complex and dynamic under the uncertain demand and the lead time. Robustness is a key index of the stable operation for the supply chain network. We investigate a fuzzy robust strategy to realize the robust operation of the supply chain network with the production lead times and the ordering lead times under the uncertain customer demand. A discrete switched model of the dynamic supply chain network with the lead times and the uncertain customer demand is established based on T-S fuzzy systems. Then a fuzzy switched strategy is proposed to control the switching actions among subsystems. Furthermore, by introducing the inhibition rate γ, a fuzzy control strategy for the dynamic supply chain network is put forward to suppress the impacts of the lead times and the uncertain customer demand on the operation of the dynamic supply chain network. The fuzzy robust strategy composed of the fuzzy switched strategy and the fuzzy control strategy can guarantee the robust operation of the supply chain network at low cost. Finally, the simulation researches show the advantage of the proposed fuzzy robust strategy through the comparisons with the common robust strategy. © 2018 Songtao Zhang et al.},

abstract={A supply chain is a system which moves products from a supplier to customers, which plays a very important role in all economic activities. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for a supply chain network design inspired by biological principles of nutrients’ distribution in protoplasmic networks of slime mould Physarum polycephalum. The algorithm handles supply networks where capacity investments and product flows are decision variables, and the networks are required to satisfy product demands. Two features of the slime mould are adopted in our algorithm. The first is the continuity of flux during the iterative process, which is used in real-time updating of the costs associated with the supply links. The second feature is adaptivity. The supply chain can converge to an equilibrium state when costs are changed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the practicality and flexibility of the proposed method algorithm. © 2016, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Recommender systems have been extensively used by the entertainment industry, business marketing and the biomedical industry. In addition to its capacity of providing preference-based recommendations as an unsupervised learning methodology, it has been also proven useful in sales forecasting, product introduction and other production related businesses. Since some consumers and companies need a recommendation or prediction for future budget, labor and supply chain coordination, dynamic recommender systems for precise forecasting have become extremely necessary. In this article, we propose a new recommendation method, namely the dynamic tensor recommender system (DTRS), which aims particularly at forecasting future recommendation. The proposed method utilizes a tensor-valued function of time to integrate time and contextual information, and creates a time-varying coefficient model for temporal tensor factorization through a polynomial spline approximation. Major advantages of the proposed method include competitive future recommendation predictions and effective prediction interval estimations. In theory, we establish the convergence rate of the proposed tensor factorization and asymptotic normality of the spline coefficient estimator. The proposed method is applied to simulations, IRI marketing data and Last.fm data. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of future time forecasting. © 2021 Yanqing Zhang, Xuan Bi, Niansheng Tang and Annie Qu.},

abstract={Offsite construction (OSC) has demonstrated various benefits, but its wide adoption is constrained by complex and dynamic supply chains. It is vital to establish a comprehensive performance measurement system for OSC supply chains, which however has seldom been explored in detail. This paper aims to identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) of OSC supply chains through a systematic review of the literature published from December 2000 to March 2021. A total of 65 KPIs were extracted from 84 articles, including 35 economic, 19 social, and 11 environmental KPIs. A consistent KPI framework was initially proposed to describe how the KPIs jointly assess OSC supply chains. The results indicate that previous research mainly focused on the economic aspect of OSC supply chains while social and environmental performance were largely overlooked. Under each aspect, several indicators were ascertained as frequently cited KPIs, while some others received relatively little attention. This paper contributes to a better understanding of OSC supply chain performance by investigating current measurement efforts from a multidimensional perspective. To practically develop a quantifiable assessment method, further research should build on the framework and pay more attention to the overall or total performance and the neglected KPIs, particularly in social and environmental aspects. © 2021 Proceedings of the International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction.

abstract={Currently, the supply chain management model has been widely adopted worldwide. Internationally renowned companies such as IBM and Walmart have made significant achievements in supply chain management and have played a greater role in promoting the growth of their interests. However, while they are enjoying their own interests, they are also facing various risks in the supply chain. From the perspective of systems engineering, this paper uses complex network theory as a research tool to study supply chain networks and systematically study the important issues of supply chain network risks. This paper analyzes the new characteristics of the relationship between enterprises and suppliers in the supply chain and which indicators should be selected as the basis for evaluating suppliers from the perspective of cooperation and development, which more comprehensively reflects the characteristics of the new enterprise–supplier relationship in the supply chain environment. This highlights the evaluation of the supplier’s cooperation ability and development ability. Aiming at the problem of supply chain network system identification and integrated evaluation, a supply chain security evaluation model and index system research framework model are proposed, and the intercompany business risk and supply chain in supply chain network evaluation are introduced. As a model for evaluating transition parameters, the study of supply chain risk propagation introduces the theory of dynamic propagation in complex networks, the law of evolution, and the supplier's dynamic supply chain risk model. The experimental results of this paper show that when the global reputation value is 0.5 and the local reputation value is 0.8 and 0.7, the trust degree changes with the change of the confidence factor; when the value of the confidence factor decreases, the degree of trust converges more and more to the global reputation and vice versa. It can be seen that this model has high feasibility. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Through the development and usage of an agent-based model, this article investigates firms' adaptive strategies against disruptions in a supply chain network. Viewing supply chain networks as complex adaptive systems, we first construct and analyze a realworld supply chain network among 2,971 firms spanning 90 industry sectors. We then develop an agent-based simulation to show how the model of firms' adaptive behaviors can leverage competition relationships within a supply chain network. The simulation also models how disruptions propagate in the supply chain network through cascading failures. With the simulation, we seek to understand if a firm's adaptive behaviors can reduce the impact of disruptions in supply chain networks. Therefore, we propose, evaluate, and analyze two types of adaptive strategies a firm can leverage to reduce the negative effects of supply chain network disruptions. First, we deploy in our model a reactive strategy, which restructures the network in response to a disruption event among first-tier suppliers. Next, we develop and propose proactive strategies, which are used when a distant disruption is observed but has not yet hit the focal firm. We discuss the implications related to how and when firms can improve their resilience against supply disruptions by leveraging adaptive strategies. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.},

abstract={Under the real circumstances of service supply chain, there is one demand appearing as the sensitive feature, to face the increasing uncertainty. It could be elaborated upon the decision variables such as price, quantity, and efforts. The member behaviors are operated and coordinated in the process of multiperiod dynamic game. Based on the multiperiod dynamic game theory, the service demand and price, quantity of goods, and efforts of members in the secondary service supply chain are considered. The paper discusses the reputation effect and ratchet effect in the multiperiod dynamic game service supply chain. Additionally, the paper describes this problem, builds a programming model based on the multiperiod dynamic game, and deduces the optimal solution. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the impact of reputation effect and ratchet effect on the agent's revenue. Through the simulation, it is found that the agency efforts are a combination result of reputation effect and ratchet effect in the process of multiperiod dynamic game. Through the long-term dynamic game, the short-term moral risk in service supply chain can be restrained so that the result under the asymmetric information is the same as that under the complete information. © 2015 Guanglan Zhou and Chunhua Ju.},

abstract={In the face of an external environment featuring a high level of risk, multiple changes, and high uncertainty, the supply chain’s emergency replenishment, collaborative management, regulation of organic commodity, and low-cost rapid response will promote its’ sustainable growth and development, which is necessary for today’s economic development. The digitization and flexibility of the supply chain are of great value in obtaining the sustainable development of the supply chain. When dealing with an uncertain environment and market risk, current supply chain flexibility not only functions through its internal organizational flexibility, but also through collaborative creation and an extended supply chain network which will proactively form a replenishment supply sub-chain driven by the need for change responsiveness. This article constructs an associated model consisting of digitization, supply chain flexibility, and sustainability using an empirical analysis method to explore the implicit correlation of these factors. The analysis results of the mediating effect model show that both digitization and flexibility have significant positive effects on the sustainable development of the supply chain. Collaborative knowledge creation and supply chain flexibility play multiple mediating roles while market uncertainty positively moderates the impact of supply chain flexibility on supply chain sustainable development. © 2021 by the authors.

The paper presents a supply chain model with duopolistic competition in terms of decentralized and centralized decision making processes that consider the network effect. First, by establishing the differential equation of network size that is a function of the network investment, the paper presents the supply chain model with dynamic competition. Then, in order to maximize the supply chain profit, the optimal value of the optimal strategy is obtained by solving the differential game. The optimal value of the optimal policy about wholesale production, retail price and effort rate is obtained. In results, in the first stage of network cycle, the profits of supply chain system with centralized decision is lower than that with decentralized decision-making, but with the passage of time, the profits will be phased in over decentralized decision situation with the greater gap. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Recent technologies (both software and hardware) have been designed to facilitate supply chain collaboration and partnership. Due to the different operational environment throughout the supply chain, the application of these technologies are very often disconnected, causing various operational wastes. We investigate this problem and propose the concept of flexible technology. We use RFID system as an example and investigate the issues related to the electromagnetic regulation in various health care environments. We propose a flexible technology system framework that automatically learns and evolves to accommodate environmental variations throughout the supply chain. Our results show that flexible technology can greatly increase supply chain productivity and collaboration efficacy.

abstract={Shipbuilding materials are characterized by diverse kinds, large quantities and wide distribution of suppliers, which make the supply network complicated. Complex networks have led to increasing uncertainties that may cause disruptions in the supply chain. Flexibility is an effective measure to cope with uncertainty, thus this paper aims to integrate flexibility into the supply chain of shipbuilding materials and explore supply, logistics, organization and quality flexibility by focusing on the requirements of shipbuilding enterprises. This paper combines Quality Function Deployment (QFD), fuzzy theory and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to guide practical design. After determining five customer requirements (CRs) and 24 design requirements (DRs), QFD links CRs and DRs to determine the most important feasible DRs for improvement of supply chain flexibility. Research results reveal that the most important design requirements can be summarized into four aspects, namely domestic procurement, supply chain member cooperation, supplier supervision, and emergency response construction. Moreover, it is found that long‐term strategic partnerships with suppliers and strategic logistics outsourcing are effective strategies. This paper provides insight into implications for strategic decisions of shipbuilding enterprises. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={In order to monitor the pressure safety status of municipal water supply network, the dynamic calculation model of pressure safety monitoring of municipal water supply network with the function of eliminating interference between neighboring nodes was studied by using the Internet of things and data processing technology. Based on the calculation of the attenuation coefficient of pressure wave in municipal pipe network, this paper discusses the establishment method of neighbor coordinates between monitoring points by the constraint of pressure wave attenuation distance, and then combines the data processing technologies such as pressure mean value, pressure difference, pressure variance, pressure variance growth rate, etc., to construct a dynamic monitoring calculation model of pressure safety state with the function of eliminating interference between neighboring nodes. The research shows that the model can complete the dynamic calculation and real-time warning of the pressure safety state monitoring of the municipal water supply network through the acquisition, processing and feedback of the pressure of the municipal water supply network, realize the pressure safety state monitoring of the municipal water supply network, and improve the dynamic information safety management level of the municipal water supply network. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The reconfiguration of supply chain is becoming a crucial concept used to deal with market disruptions and changes such as the COVID-19 pandemic, demand uncertainty, and new technologies. It can be defined as the ability of the supply chain to change its structure and functions in order to adapt to new changes. Its assessment requires an understanding of its quantitative factors to provide indicators that are easy to interpret. Effective reconfigurability assessment can be achieved by measuring quantitatively its six characteristics (modularity, integrability, convertibility, diagnosability, scalability, and customization). This paper aims at identifying the quantitative factors of each characteristic and their inter-relationships by using Total Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM). The structural model obtained by TISM is applied to understand the dependency quantitative factors. Based on TISM results, a classification of quantitative factors is determined using “Matrice d′Impacts Croisés, Multiplication Appliquée à un Classement” (MICMAC) analysis. This article provides a better understanding of the six characteristics previously mentioned to improve the reconfigurability of supply chains by considering the interactions between their factors. Thus, this analysis helps managers to understand the characteristics that influence the change of the supply chain structure and those that enable changing the supply chain functions in order to optimize the supply chain reconfiguration process. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

The decision-making process for the reconfiguration of supply chains must take into consideration the uncertainty and imprecision related to the judgments of the decision-makers. This paper deals with uncertainty in the decision-making process of supply chain reconfiguration using the Dempster-Shafer theory. An approach to reconfigure supply chain business processes under uncertainty is also proposed to improve the decision-making process for supply chain reconfiguration. The reconfiguration of the supply chain involves selecting the most appropriate configuration, process, actor and role that should be reconfigured in advance in order to optimise the reconfiguration using the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. To reduce the imprecision and uncertainty related to the judgments and preferences of the decision-makers, the Dempster-Shafer theory is applied and, to validate the introduced approach, a case study is conducted. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We also show the importance of integrating the direction of flows, i.e. inbound and outbound flows in the calculation of modularity and, in particular, its impact on lead time.

abstract={The COVID 19 pandemic, fluctuating demand, market uncertainty and the emergence of new technologies explain the need for a more flexible and agile supply chain. In fact, several important factors should be taken into account in the process of building an adaptive and reconfigurable supply chain. Reconfigurability is used to measure quantitatively the capability of supply chain to change easily their structure and functions. The aim of this work is to evaluate the level of reconfigurability of a supply chain. Quantitative measures of six indicators that characterize reconfigurability are presented in this paper. Then, an index of reconfigurability in supply chain is developed based on The Multi-Attribute Utility Theory in order to choose the most reconfigurable configuration. An illustrative example is also given. From the discussion, it is deduced that the characteristics of the reconfigurable supply chain impacts positively on the degree of reconfigurability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This contribution presents the application of a systematic tool for the synthesis of flexible supply networks under uncertain conditions. The proposed methodology consists of four steps during which an inflexible supply network constructed under nominal conditions progressively develops into a flexible network. First-stage variables are determined by a two-scenario mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model in which uncertain parameters deviate through specified ranges from their nominal values. The second-stage variables are determined by one-scenario Monte Carlo stochastic optimization. The approach is demonstrated on an illustrative case study of an agricultural biogas supply network with the objective being to maximize economic, eco- and viability profits. Flexible biogas supply networks with 28 uncertain parameters were achieved with acceptable computational effort. The expected economic and viability profits decreased compared to nominal profits by around 8%, while the eco-profit increased slightly as a result of higher utilization of less burdensome raw materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Planning in supply chains is characterized by uncertainties. These can be disruptive as well as operational risks, but also business opportunities. To deal with uncertainties, various approaches suggest supply chains that are robust, resilient, and agile (RoRA). To accomplish this, flexibility is necessary. Aspects of flexibility in supply chain management (SCM) have been analyzed from different angles. But still a holistic concept on how flexibility planning can be integrated in the process of supply chain planning does not exist. This paper gives an overview on optimization models used for flexibility planning in supply chains and identifies the characteristics of such a planning process. Which tasks of SCM the components of flexibility planning have to be integrated in is discussed along the structure of the supply chain planning matrix. An outlook on further research on flexibility planning in RoRA-SCM is also given. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={Purpose: Research has not yet captured nor synthesized the supply chain (SC) adaptations exercised by various base of the pyramid (BoP) initiators for successful BoP business. This is a crucial shortcoming that the study has taken a step to address, with the aim of advancing theory in BoP supply chain management (SCM). The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw on Carter et al.’s (2015) theory of the SC and use a multi-method approach combining systematic literature review and embedded case studies based on the secondary data. Findings: The authors compare BoP SC adaptations of MNCs, local companies, NGOs, social enterprises and governments and develop propositions. The authors find that SC adaptations exercised by BoP initiators are influenced by their sense making of institutional and agency drivers at the BoP, and contingent on whether the poor are engaged as recipients or value co-creators. Practical implications: The authors develop a multi-initiator understanding of SC adaptations for BoP business. This is useful for BoP initiators who struggle to leverage their BoP business as well as for those who are considering entering the BoP. The authors offer these entities insights for aligning strategy and developing capabilities for BoP markets. Originality/value: The authors develop an original model of BoP initiator-based configurations of SC adaptations for BoP business. As such, the authors contribute toward advancing BoP SCM theory and practice by mapping substantive concepts and their relationships associated with BoP SC adaptations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Supplier selection is nowadays one of the critical topics in supply chain management. This paper presents a new decision making approach for group multi-criteria supplier selection problem, which clubs supplier selection process with order allocation for dynamic supply chains to cope market variations. More specifically, the developed approach imitates the knowledge acquisition and manipulation in a manner similar to the decision makers who have gathered considerable knowledge and expertise in procurement domain. Nevertheless, under many conditions, exact data are inadequate to model real-life situation and fuzzy logic can be incorporated to handle the vagueness of the decision makers. As per this concept, fuzzy-AHP method is used first for supplier selection through four classes (CLASS I: Performance strategy, CLASS II: Quality of service, CLASS III: Innovation and CLASS IV: Risk), which are qualitatively meaningful. Thereafter, using simulation based fuzzy TOPSIS technique, the criteria application is quantitatively evaluated for order allocation among the selected suppliers. As a result, the approach generates decision-making knowledge, and thereafter, the developed combination of rules order allocation can easily be interpreted, adopted and at the same time if necessary, modified by decision makers. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, an illustrative example is presented and the results analyzed. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={To better understand the different effects of the myopic and far-sighted behaviors on the advertising coordination in dynamic supply chain, this paper takes the reference price effect into consideration and formulates four differential game models for the two-level supply chain composed of a manufacturer and a retailer in the situation of Stackelberg game. In our models, the market demand is assumed to be affected by the goodwill, reference price, and the advertising investment, in which the advertising investment can promote the construction of goodwill and such goodwill can further enhance the reference price. The results show that the participating members in the supply chain should invest more in advertisement to improve the goodwill and the relative reference price reflected in the minds of consumers. A far-sighted manufacturer will invest more in the advertisement and charge a higher wholesale price regardless of the behavior choice of the retailer. However, such kind of ignorance leads to different results on the retail pricing strategies of the retailer. The numerical analyses are given in the end to verify the effectiveness of the conclusions which provide the theoretical support to the dynamic supply chain coordination in practice. © 2017 Yafei Zu and Lianghua Chen.},

abstract={The term Industry 4.0 is now commonly used to outline the many strands of increased digitization that will lead to smarter factories and streamlined production. Industry 4.0, or Digital Manufacturing is the overarching blueprint for the fourth industrial revolution that encompasses the IIoT, autonomous manufacturing systems, business systems and people to deliver increased supply chain flexibility, greater product customization and shorter lead times. IIoT is already having a significant impact on industrial performance in two primary areas: asset performance management and operator efficiency. In the production system of the future, entire plants will be digitally linked, allowing the balancing of capacity utilization across the network. Automatic adaptation of production lines to ordering capacities will be made possible through the simple, rapid extension or reduction of the manufacturing facilities. These new environments will be characterized by closer collaboration between humans and technology, with improved sensor capabilities. Industry 4.0 isn't restricted to the adoption of new technologies. It will also require a fundamental change in the way that managers and shopfloor employees carry out their roles within production environments.},
